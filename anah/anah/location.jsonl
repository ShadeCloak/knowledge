{"name": "Wyoming", "documents": ["# Wyoming\nWyoming (/waɪˈoʊmɪŋ/ (listen)) is a state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States. It is bordered by Montana to the north and northwest, South Dakota and Nebraska to the east, Idaho to the west, Utah to the southwest, and Colorado to the south. With a population of 576,851 in the 2020 United States census, Wyoming is the least populous state despite being the 10th largest by area, with the second-lowest population density after Alaska. The state capital and most populous city is Cheyenne, which had an estimated population of 63,957 in 2018.\nWyoming's western half is covered mostly by the ranges and rangelands of the Rocky Mountains, while the eastern half of the state is high-elevation prairie called the High Plains. It is drier and windier than the rest of the country, being split between semi-arid and continental climates with greater temperature extremes. Almost half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the federal government, generally protected for public uses. The state ranks 6th by area and fifth by proportion of a state's land owned by the federal government. Federal lands include two national parks (Grand Teton and Yellowstone), two national recreation areas, two national monuments, several national forests, historic sites, fish hatcheries, and wildlife refuges.\nIndigenous peoples inhabited the region for thousands of years. Historic and current federally recognized tribes include the Arapaho, Crow, Lakota, and Shoshone. During European exploration, the Spanish Empire was the first to \"claim\" southern Wyoming. With Mexican independence, it became part of that republic. After defeat in the Mexican–American War, Mexico ceded this territory to the U.S. in 1848.\nThe region was named \"Wyoming\" in a bill introduced to Congress in 1865 to provide a temporary government for the territory of Wyoming. It had been used earlier by colonists for the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, and is derived from the Lenape language Munsee word xwé:wamənk, meaning \"at the big river flat\".\nBills for Wyoming Territory's admission to the union were introduced in both the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives in December 1889. On March 27, 1890, the House passed the bill and President Benjamin Harrison signed Wyoming's statehood bill; Wyoming became the 44th state in the union.\nHistorically, European Americans farmed and ranched here, with shepherds and cattle ranchers in conflict over lands. Today Wyoming's economy is largely based on tourism and the extraction of minerals such as coal, natural gas, oil, and trona. Agricultural commodities include barley, hay, livestock, sugar beets, wheat, and wool. It was the first state to allow women the right to vote and the right to assume elected office, as well as the first state to elect a female governor. Due to this part of its history, its main nickname is \"The Equality State\" and its official state motto is \"Equal Rights\". It has been a politically conservative state since the 1950s. The Republican presidential nominee has carried the state in every election since 1968.\n## History\nSeveral Native American groups originally inhabited the region today known as Wyoming. The Crow, Arapaho, Lakota, and Shoshone were but a few of the original inhabitants European explorers encountered when they first visited the region. What is now southwestern Wyoming was claimed by the Spanish Empire, which extended through the Southwest and Mexico. With Mexican independence in 1821, it was considered part of Alta California. U.S. expansion brought settlers who fought for control. Mexico ceded these territories after its defeat in 1848 in the Mexican–American War.\nFrom the late 18th century, French-Canadian trappers from Québec and Montréal regularly entered the area for trade with the tribes. French toponyms such as Téton and La Ramie are marks of that history.\nAmerican John Colter first recorded a description in English of the region in 1807. He was a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which was guided by French Canadian Toussaint Charbonneau and his young Shoshone wife, Sacagawea. At the time, Colter's reports of the Yellowstone area were considered fictional. On a return from Astoria, Robert Stuart and a party of five men discovered South Pass in 1812.\nThe Oregon Trail later followed that route as emigrants moved to the west coast. In 1850, mountain man Jim Bridger found what is now known as Bridger Pass. Bridger also explored Yellowstone, and filed reports on the region that, like Colter's, were largely regarded at the time as tall tales. The Union Pacific Railroad constructed track through Bridger Pass in 1868. It was used as the route for construction of Interstate 80 through the mountains 90 years later.\nThe region acquired the name Wyoming by 1865, when Representative James Mitchell Ashley of Ohio introduced a bill to Congress to provide a \"temporary government for the territory of Wyoming\". The territory was named after the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania. Thomas Campbell wrote his 1809 poem \"Gertrude of Wyoming\", inspired by the Battle of Wyoming in the American Revolutionary War. The name ultimately derives from the Lenape Munsee word xwé:wamənk (\"at the big river flat\").\nAfter the Union Pacific Railroad reached Cheyenne in 1867, population growth was stimulated. The federal government established the Wyoming Territory on July 25, 1868. Lacking significant deposits of gold and silver, unlike mineral-rich Colorado, Wyoming did not have such a population boom. But South Pass City had a short-lived boom after the Carissa Mine began producing gold in 1867. Copper was mined in some areas between the Sierra Madre Mountains and the Snowy Range near Grand Encampment.\nOnce government-sponsored expeditions to the Yellowstone country began, Colter's and Bridger's descriptions of the region's landscape were confirmed. In 1872, Yellowstone National Park was created as the world's first, to protect this area. Nearly all of the park lies within the northwestern corner of Wyoming.\nOn December 10, 1869, territorial Governor John Allen Campbell extended the right to vote to women, making Wyoming the first territory to do so. It kept that franchise when it established its state constitution. Women first served on juries in Wyoming (Laramie in 1870).\nWyoming was also a pioneer in welcoming women into electoral politics. It had the first female court bailiff (Mary Atkinson, Laramie, in 1870), and the first female justice of the peace in the country (Esther Hobart Morris, South Pass City, in 1870). In 1924, Wyoming was the first state to elect a female governor, Nellie Tayloe Ross, who took office in January 1925. Due to its civil-rights history, one of Wyoming's state nicknames is \"The Equality State\", and the official state motto is \"Equal Rights\".\nWyoming's constitution included women's suffrage and a pioneering article on water rights. Congress admitted Wyoming into the Union as the 44th state on July 10, 1890.\nWyoming was the location of the Johnson County War of 1892, which erupted between competing groups of cattle ranchers. The passage of the Homestead Act led to an influx of small ranchers. A range war broke out when either or both of the groups chose violent conflict over commercial competition in the use of the public land.\n## Geography\n### Climate\nWyoming's climate is generally semi-arid and continental (Köppen climate classification BSk) and is drier and windier in comparison to most of the United States with greater temperature extremes. Much of this is due to the topography of the state. Summers in Wyoming are warm with July high temperatures averaging between 80 and 90 °F (27 and 32 °C) in most of the state. With increasing elevation, however, this average drops rapidly with locations above 9,000 feet (2,700 m) averaging around 70 °F (21 °C). Summer nights throughout the state are characterized by a rapid cooldown with even the hottest locations averaging in the 50–60 °F (10–16 °C) range at night. In most of the state, most of the precipitation tends to fall in the late spring and early summer. Winters are cold, but are variable with periods of sometimes extreme cold interspersed between generally mild periods, with Chinook winds providing unusually warm temperatures in some locations.\nWyoming is a dry state with much of the land receiving less than 10 inches (250 mm) of rainfall per year. Precipitation depends on elevation with lower areas in the Big Horn Basin averaging 5–8 inches (130–200 mm), making the area nearly a true desert. The lower areas in the North and on the eastern plains typically average around 10–12 inches (250–300 mm), making the climate there semi-arid. Some mountain areas do receive a good amount of precipitation, 20 inches (510 mm) or more, much of it as snow, sometimes 200 inches (510 cm) or more annually. The state's highest recorded temperature is 114 °F (46 °C) at Basin on July 12, 1900, and the lowest recorded temperature is −66 °F (−54 °C) at Riverside on February 9, 1933.\nThe number of thunderstorm days vary across the state with the southeastern plains of the state having the most days of thunderstorm activity. Thunderstorm activity in the state is highest during the late spring and early summer. The southeastern corner of the state is the most vulnerable part of the state to tornado activity. Moving away from that point and westwards, the incidence of tornadoes drops dramatically with the west part of the state showing little vulnerability. Tornadoes, where they occur, tend to be small and brief, unlike some of those that occur farther east.\n### Location and size\nAs specified in the designating legislation for the Territory of Wyoming, Wyoming's borders are lines of latitude 41°N and 45°N, and longitude 104°3'W and 111°3'W (27 and 34 west of the Washington Meridian)—a geodesic quadrangle. Wyoming is one of only three states (the others being Colorado and Utah) to have borders defined by only \"straight\" lines. Due to surveying inaccuracies during the 19th century, Wyoming's legal border deviates from the true latitude and longitude lines by up to half of a mile (0.8 km) in some spots, especially in the mountainous region along the 45th parallel. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. It is the tenth largest state in the United States in total area, containing 97,814 square miles (253,340 km2) and is made up of 23 counties. From the north border to the south border it is 276 miles (444 km); and from the east to the west border is 365 miles (587 km) at its south end and 342 miles (550 km) at the north end.\n### Natural landforms\n#### Mountain ranges\nThe Great Plains meet the Rocky Mountains in Wyoming. The state is a great plateau broken by many mountain ranges. Surface elevations range from the summit of Gannett Peak in the Wind River Mountain Range, at 13,804 feet (4,207 m), to the Belle Fourche River valley in the state's northeast corner, at 3,125 feet (952 m). In the northwest are the Absaroka, Owl Creek, Gros Ventre, Wind River, and the Teton ranges. In the north central are the Big Horn Mountains; in the northeast, the Black Hills; and in the southern region the Laramie, Snowy, and Sierra Madre ranges.\nThe Snowy Range in the south central part of the state is an extension of the Colorado Rockies both in geology and in appearance. The Wind River Range in the west central part of the state is remote and includes more than 40 mountain peaks in excess of 13,000 ft (4,000 m) tall in addition to Gannett Peak, the highest peak in the state. The Bighorn Mountains in the north central portion are somewhat isolated from the bulk of the Rocky Mountains.\nThe Teton Range in the northwest extends for 50 miles (80 km), part of which is included in Grand Teton National Park. The park includes the Grand Teton, the second-highest peak in the state.\nThe Continental Divide spans north–south across the central portion of the state. Rivers east of the divide drain into the Missouri River Basin and eventually the Gulf of Mexico. They are the North Platte, Wind, Bighorn, and Yellowstone rivers. The Snake River in northwest Wyoming eventually drains into the Columbia River and the Pacific Ocean, as does the Green River through the Colorado River Basin.\nThe Continental Divide forks in the south central part of the state in an area known as the Great Divide Basin where water that precipitates onto or flows into it cannot reach an ocean—it all sinks into the soil and eventually evaporates.\nSeveral rivers begin in or flow through the state, including the Yellowstone River, Bighorn River, Green River, and the Snake River.\n#### Basins\nMuch of Wyoming is covered with large basins containing different eco-regions, from shrublands to smaller patches of desert. Regions of the state classified as basins contain everything from large geologic formations to sand dunes and vast unpopulated spaces. Basin landscapes are typically at lower elevations and include rolling hills, valleys, mesas, terraces and other rugged terrain, but also include natural springs as well as rivers and artificial reservoirs. They have common plant species such as various subspecies of sagebrush, juniper and grasses such as wheatgrass, but basins are known for their diversity of plant and animal species.\n#### Islands\nWyoming has 32 named islands; the majority are in Jackson Lake and Yellowstone Lake, within Yellowstone National Park in the northwest portion of the state. The Green River in the southwest also contains a number of islands.\n### Regions and administrative divisions\n#### Counties\nThe state of Wyoming has 23 counties.\nWyoming license plates have a number on the left that indicates the county where the vehicle is registered, ranked by an earlier census. Specifically, the numbers are representative of the property values of the counties in 1930. The county license plate numbers are:\n#### Cities and towns\nThe State of Wyoming has 99 incorporated municipalities.\nIn 2005, 50.6% of Wyomingites lived in one of the 13 most populous Wyoming municipalities.\n#### Metropolitan areas\nThe United States Census Bureau has defined two Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) and seven Micropolitan Statistical Areas (MiSA) for the State of Wyoming. In 2008, 30.4% of Wyomingites lived in either of the Metropolitan Statistical Areas, and 73% lived in either a Metropolitan Statistical Area or a Micropolitan Statistical Area.\n## Demographics\n### Population\nThe United States Census Bureau estimates the population of Wyoming was 578,759 in 2019. The center of population of Wyoming is in Natrona County.\nIn 2014, the United States Census Bureau estimated the population's racial composition was 92.7% white (82.9% non-Hispanic white), 2.7% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.6% Black or African American, 1.0% Asian American, and 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. As of 2011, 24.9% of Wyoming's population younger than age 1 were minorities. According to data from the American Community Survey, as of 2018, Wyoming was the only U.S. state where African Americans earn a higher median income than white workers.\nAccording to the 2010 census, the racial composition of the population was 90.7% white, 0.8% black or African American, 2.4% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.8% Asian American, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 2.2% from two or more races, and 3.0% from some other race. Ethnically, 8.9% of the total population was of Hispanic or Latino origin (they may be of any race) and 91.1% Non-Hispanic, with non-Hispanic whites constituting the largest non-Hispanic group at 85.9%.\nAs of 2015, Wyoming had an estimated population of 586,107, which was an increase of 1,954, or 0.29%, from the prior year and an increase of 22,481, or 3.99%, since the 2010 census. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 12,165 (33,704 births minus 21,539 deaths) and an increase from net migration of 4,035 into the state. Immigration resulted in a net increase of 2,264 and migration within the country produced a net increase of 1,771. In 2004, the foreign-born population was 11,000 (2.2%). In 2005, total births in Wyoming were 7,231 (birth rate of 14.04 per thousand). Sparsely populated, Wyoming is the least populous state of the United States. Wyoming has the second-lowest population density in the country (behind Alaska) and is the sparsest-populated of the 48 contiguous states. It is one of only two states (Vermont) with a population smaller than that of the nation's capital.\nAccording to the 2000 census, the largest ancestry groups in Wyoming were: German (26.0%), English (16.0%), Irish (13.3%), Norwegian (4.3%), and Swedish (3.5%).\n### Birth data\nNote: Births in table don't add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\nSince 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one Hispanic group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.\n### Languages\nIn 2010, 93.39% (474,343) of Wyomingites over age 5 spoke English as their primary language; 4.47% (22,722) spoke Spanish, 0.35% (1,771) spoke German, and 0.28% (1,434) spoke French. Other common non-English languages included Algonquian (0.18%), Russian (0.10%), Tagalog, and Greek (both 0.09%).\nIn 2007, the American Community Survey reported 6.2% (30,419) of Wyoming's population over five spoke a language other than English at home. Of those, 68.1% were able to speak English very well, 16.0% spoke English well, 10.9% did not speak English well, and 5.0% did not speak English at all.\n### Religion\nIn 2020, the Public Religion Research Institute determined that about 55% of Wyoming's adult population was Christian, primarily evangelical and mainline Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Mormon. The Public Religion Research Institute survery documented a decrease in religiosity from a 2014 Pew Research Center study; according to the Public Religion Research Institute, the irreligious made up 40% of the state population by 2020. According to a 2013 Gallup poll, Wyomingites' religious affiliations were 49% Protestant, 23% nonreligious or other, 18% Catholic, 9% Latter-day Saint (Mormons), and less than 1% Jewish.\nA 2010 ARDA report recognized as Wyoming's largest denominations the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), with 62,804 (11%); the Catholic Church, with 61,222 (10.8%); and the Southern Baptist Convention, with 15,812 (2.8%). The report counted 59,247 evangelical Protestants (10.5%), 36,539 mainline Protestants (6.5%), 785 Eastern Orthodox Christians; 281 Black Protestants; 65,000 adhering to other traditions; and 340,552 claiming no religious tradition.\n## Economy and infrastructure\nAccording to a 2012 United States Bureau of Economic Analysis report, Wyoming's gross state product was $38.4 billion. As of 2014, the population was growing slightly with the most growth in tourist-oriented areas such as Teton County. Boom conditions in neighboring states such as North Dakota were drawing energy workers away. About half of Wyoming's counties showed population loss. The state makes active efforts through Wyoming Grown, an internet-based recruitment program, to find jobs for young people educated in Wyoming who have emigrated but may wish to return.\nThe mineral extraction industry and travel and tourism sector are the main drivers of Wyoming's economy. The federal government owns about 50% of its landmass, while the state controls 6%. The total taxable value of mining production in Wyoming in 2001 was over $6.7 billion. The tourism industry accounts for over $2 billion in revenue.\nIn 2002, more than six million people visited Wyoming's national parks and monuments. Wyoming's main tourist attractions include Grand Teton National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Devils Tower National Monument, Independence Rock and Fossil Butte National Monument. Yellowstone, the world's first national park, receives three million visitors each year.\nHistorically, agriculture has been an important component of Wyoming's economy. Its overall importance to the economy has waned, but it is still an essential part of Wyoming's culture and lifestyle. The main agricultural commodities Wyoming produces include livestock (beef), hay, sugar beets, grain (wheat and barley), and wool. More than 91% of Wyoming's land is classified as rural.\nWyoming is the home of only a handful of companies with a regional or national presence. Taco John's and Sierra Trading Post, both in Cheyenne, are privately held. Cloud Peak Energy in Gillette and U.S. Energy Corp. (NASDAQ: USEG) in Riverton are Wyoming's only publicly traded companies.\n### Mineral and energy production\nWyoming's mineral commodities include coal, natural gas, coalbed methane, crude oil, uranium, and trona.\nWyoming produced 277 million short tons (251.29 million metric tons) of coal in 2019, a 9% drop from 2018. Wyoming's coal production peaked in 2008, when 514 million short tons (466.3 million metric tons) were produced. Wyoming has a reserve of 68.7 billion tons (62.3 billion metric tons) of coal. Major coal areas include the Powder River Basin and the Green River Basin. The boom for coalbed methane (CBM) began in the mid-1990s. CBM is methane gas extracted from Wyoming's coal bed seams. It is a means of natural gas production. There has been substantial CBM production in the Powder River Basin. In 2002, the CBM production yield was 327.5 billion cubic feet (9.3 km3). Wyoming produced 53.4 million barrels (8.49×10^6 m3) of crude oil in 2007. The state ranked fifth nationwide in oil production in 2007. Petroleum is most often used as a motor fuel, but is also used in the manufacture of plastics, paints, and synthetic rubber. The Kelsey Lake Diamond Mine in Colorado, less than 1,000 feet (300 m) from the Wyoming border, produced gem-quality diamonds for several years. The Wyoming craton, which hosts the kimberlite volcanic pipes that were mined, underlies most of Wyoming. Wyoming produced 1.77 trillion cubic feet (50.0 billion m3) of natural gas in 2016, ranking the state ranked 6th nationwide in natural gas production. Major markets for natural gas include industrial, commercial, and domestic heating. Wyoming possesses the world's largest known reserve of trona, a mineral used in manufacturing glass, paper, soaps, baking soda, water softeners, and pharmaceuticals. In 2008, Wyoming produced 46 million short tons (41.7 million metric tons) of trona, 25% of the world's production. Because of its geography and altitude, the potential for wind power in Wyoming is one of the highest of any U.S. state. The Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project is the largest commercial wind generation facility under development in North America. Carbon County is home to the largest proposed wind farm in the nation. Construction plans have been halted because of proposed new taxes on wind power energy production. Although uranium mining in Wyoming is much less active than in previous decades, recent increases in uranium's price have generated new interest in prospecting and mining.\n### Taxes\nUnlike most other states, Wyoming levies no individual or corporate income tax. It also assesses no tax on retirement income earned and received from another state. Wyoming has a state sales tax of 4%. Counties have the option to collect an additional 1% tax for general revenue and a 1% tax for specific purposes, if approved by voters. Food for human consumption is not subject to sales tax. A county lodging tax varies from 2% to 5%. The state collects a use tax of 5% on items purchased elsewhere and brought into Wyoming. All property tax is based on the proprety's assessed value; Wyoming's Department of Revenue's Ad Valorem Tax Division supports, trains, and guides local government agencies in the uniform assessment, valuation and taxation of locally assessed property. \"Assessed value\" means taxable value; \"taxable value\" means a percentage of the fair market value of property in a particular class. Statutes limit property tax increases. For county revenue, the property tax rate cannot exceed 12 mills (or 1.2%) of assessed value. For cities and towns, the rate is limited to eight mills (0.8%). With very few exceptions, state law limits the property tax rate for all governmental purposes.\nPersonal property held for personal use is tax-exempt. Inventory held for resale, pollution control equipment, cash, accounts receivable, stocks and bonds are also exempt. Other exemptions include property used for religious, educational, charitable, fraternal, benevolent and government purposes and improvements for handicapped access. Mine lands, underground mining equipment, and oil and gas extraction equipment are exempt from property tax, but companies must pay a gross products tax on minerals and a severance tax on mineral production.\nWyoming does not collect inheritance taxes. There is limited estate tax related to federal estate tax collection.\nIn 2008, the Tax Foundation reported that Wyoming had the most \"business-friendly\" tax climate of any U.S. state. Wyoming state and local governments in fiscal year 2007 collected $2.242 billion in taxes, levies, and royalties from the oil and gas industry. The state's mineral industry, including oil, gas, trona, and coal, provided $1.3 billion in property taxes from 2006 mineral production. As of 2017, Wyoming receives more federal tax dollars as a percentage of state general revenue than any state except Montana.\nAs of 2016, Wyoming does not require the beneficial owners of LLCs to be disclosed in the filing, which creates an opportunity for a tax haven, according to Clark Stith of Clark Stith & Associates.\n### Transportation\nWyoming's largest airport is Jackson Hole Airport, with more than 500 employees. Three interstate highways and 13 U.S. highways pass through Wyoming. The Wyoming state highway system also serves the state.\nInterstate 25 enters Wyoming south of Cheyenne and runs north, intersecting Interstate 80 immediately west of Cheyenne. It passes through Casper and ends at Interstate 90, near Buffalo. Interstate 80 crosses the Utah border west of Evanston and runs east through the southern third of the state, passing through Cheyenne before entering Nebraska near Pine Bluffs. Interstate 90 comes into Wyoming near Parkman and cuts through the northeastern part of the state. It serves Gillette and enters South Dakota east of Sundance.\nU.S. Routes 14, 16, and the eastern section of U.S. 20 have their western terminus at the eastern entrance to Yellowstone National Park and pass through Cody. U.S. 14 runs eastward before joining I-90 at Gillette. U.S. 14 then follows I-90 to the South Dakota border. U.S. 16 and 20 split off of U.S. 14 at Greybull and U.S. 16 turns east at Worland while U.S. 20 continues south Shoshoni. U.S. Route 287 runs from Fort Collins, Colorado, to Laramie, Wyoming, through a pass between the Laramie Mountains and the Medicine Bow Mountains, then merges with US 30 and I-80 until it reaches Rawlins, where it continues north, passing Lander. Outside of Moran, U.S. 287 is part of a large interchange with U.S. Highways 26, 191, and 89, before continuing north to Yellowstone's southern entrance. U.S. 287 continues north of Yellowstone, but the park separates the two sections.\nOther U.S. highways that pass through Wyoming are 18, 26, 30, 85, 87, 89, 189, 191, 212, and 287.\nWyoming is one of only two states (the other is South Dakota) in the 48 contiguous states not served by Amtrak. It was once served by Amtrak's San Francisco Zephyr and Pioneer lines. While no passenger trains roll through Wyoming today, intercity buses continue to connect residents across the state. Intercity bus carriers in the state include Express Arrow, Greyhound Lines, and Jefferson Lines.\n### Major interstates\nI-25 (300.5 mi) connects Denver, Cheyenne, Casper and Buffalo. Most of the highway is connected with US 87. Major junctions include Interstate 80, US 30, US 85, US 26, US Routes 18 & 20 and US 16 before its northern terminus at Interstate 90 in Buffalo. I-80 (402.8 mi) connects Evanston, Rock Springs, Rawlins, Laramie and Cheyenne. Major junctions include US 191, US 287, I-25, and US 85 & I-180. I-90 (208.8 mi) connects Sheridan, Buffalo and Gillette. Primarily in northeastern Wyoming. Major junctions include US 14, I-25 and US 16.\n#### Wind River Indian Reservation\nThe Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes share the Wind River Indian Reservation in central western Wyoming, near Lander. The reservation is home to 2,500 Eastern Shoshone and 5,000 Northern Arapaho.\nChief Washakie established the reservation in 1868 as the result of negotiations with the federal government in the Fort Bridger Treaty, but the federal government forced the Northern Arapaho onto the Shoshone reservation in 1876 after it failed to provide a promised separate reservation.\nToday the Wind River Indian Reservation is jointly owned, with each tribe having a 50% interest in the land, water, and other natural resources. It is a sovereign, self-governed land with two independent governing bodies: the Eastern Shoshone Tribe and the Northern Arapaho Tribe. Until 2014, the Shoshone Business Council and Northern Arapaho Business Council met jointly as the Joint Business Council to decide matters that affect both tribes. Six elected council members from each tribe served on the joint council.\n#### Public lands\nThe federal government owns nearly half of Wyoming's land (about 30,099,430 acres (121,808.1 km2)); the state owns another 3,864,800 acres (15,640 km2). Most of it is administered by the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service in numerous national forests and a national grassland, not to mention vast swaths of \"public\" land and an air force base near Cheyenne.\nThere are also areas managed by the National Park Service and agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\nGrand Teton National Park Yellowstone National Park—first designated national park in the world\nThe John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway connects Yellowstone and Grand Teton.\nBighorn Canyon National Recreation Area Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area (managed by the Forest Service as part of Ashley National Forest)\nDevils Tower National Monument—first national monument in the U.S. Fossil Butte National Monument\nCalifornia National Historic Trail Fort Laramie National Historic Site Independence Rock National Historic Landmark Medicine Wheel/Medicine Mountain National Historic Landmark Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail National Register of Historic Places listings in Wyoming Oregon National Historic Trail Pony Express National Historic Trail\nJackson National Fish Hatchery Saratoga National Fish Hatchery\nNational Elk Refuge Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge\nYellowstone National Park Devils Tower National Monument Thunder Basin National Grassland Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge\n## Education\nThe state superintendent of public instruction, an elected state official, directs public education. The State Board of Education, a nine-member board appointed by the governor, sets educational policy. The constitution prohibits the state from establishing curriculum and textbook selections; these are the prerogative of local school boards. The Wyoming School for the Deaf was the only in-state school dedicated to supporting deaf students before it closed in the summer of 2000.\n### Higher education\nWyoming has a public four-year institution, the University of Wyoming in Laramie, and a private four-year college, Wyoming Catholic College, in Lander. There are also seven two-year community colleges.\nBefore the passing of a new law in 2006, Wyoming had hosted unaccredited institutions, many of them suspected diploma mills. The 2006 law requires unaccredited institutions to make one of three choices: move out of Wyoming, close down, or apply for accreditation. The Oregon State Office of Degree Authorization predicted in 2007 that in a few years the problem of diploma mills in Wyoming might be resolved.\n## Media\nWyoming's media market consists of 16 broadcast TV stations, radio stations and dozens of small to medium-sized newspapers. There are also a few small independent news sources such as the nonprofit news site Wyofile.com and Oil City News.\n## Government and politics\n### State government\nWyoming's Constitution established three branches of government: the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The state legislature comprises a House of Representatives with 60 members and a Senate with 30 members. The executive branch is headed by the governor and includes a secretary of state, auditor, treasurer, and superintendent of public instruction. As Wyoming does not have a lieutenant governor, the secretary of state is first in the line of succession.\nWyoming's sparse population warrants the state only one at-large seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, and hence only three votes in the Electoral College.\nThe Wyoming State Liquor Association is the state's sole legal wholesale distributor of spirits, making it an alcoholic beverage control state. With the exception of wine, state law prohibits the purchase of alcoholic beverages for resale from any other source.\n### Judicial system\nWyoming's highest court is the Supreme Court of Wyoming, with five justices presiding over appeals from the state's lower courts. Wyoming is unusual in that it does not have an intermediate appellate court, like most states. This is largely attributable to the state's population and correspondingly lower caseload. Appeals from the state district courts go directly to the Wyoming Supreme Court. Wyoming also has state circuit courts (formerly county courts), of limited jurisdiction, which handle certain types of cases, such as civil claims with lower dollar amounts, misdemeanor criminal offenses, and felony arraignments. Circuit court judges also commonly hear small claims cases as well.\nBefore 1972, Wyoming judges were selected by popular vote on a nonpartisan ballot. This earlier system was criticized by the state bar who called for the adoption of the Missouri Plan, a system designed to balance judiciary independence with judiciary accountability. In 1972, an amendment to Article 5 of the Wyoming Constitution, which incorporated a modified version of the plan, was adopted by the voters. Since the adoption of the amendment, all state court judges in Wyoming are nominated by the Judicial Nominating Commission and appointed by the Governor. They are then subject to a retention vote by the electorate one year after appointment.\n### Political history\nWyoming's political history defies easy classification. The state was the first to grant women the right to vote and to elect a woman governor. On December 10, 1869, John Allen Campbell, the first Governor of the Wyoming Territory, approved the first law in United States history explicitly granting women the right to vote. This day was later commemorated as Wyoming Day. On November 5, 1889, voters approved the first constitution in the world granting full voting rights to women.\nWhile the state elected notable Democrats to federal office in the 1960s and 1970s, politics have become decidedly more conservative since the 1980s as the Republican Party came to dominate the state's congressional delegation. Today, Wyoming is represented in Washington by its two Senators, John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, and its one member of the House of Representatives, Congresswoman Liz Cheney. All three are Republicans; a Democrat has not represented Wyoming in the Senate since 1977 or in the House since 1978. The state has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964, one of only eight times since statehood. At present, there is only one relatively reliably Democratic county, affluent Teton, and one swing county, college county Albany. In the 2004 presidential election, George W. Bush won his second-largest victory, with 69% of the vote. Former Vice President Dick Cheney is a Wyoming resident and represented the state in Congress from 1979 to 1989.\nRepublicans are no less dominant at the state level. They have held a majority in the state senate continuously since 1936 and in the state house since 1964, though Democrats held the governorship for all but eight years between 1975 and 2011. Uniquely, Wyoming elected Democrat Nellie Tayloe Ross as the first woman in United States history to serve as state governor. She served from 1925 to 1927, winning a special election after her husband, William Bradford Ross, unexpectedly died a little more than a year into his term.\nIn a 2020 study, Wyoming was ranked as the 25th hardest state for citizens to vote in.\n## Culture\n### Sports\nDue to its sparse population, Wyoming lacks any major professional sports teams; the Wyoming Mustangs, an indoor football team based in Gillette that began play in 2021, is the only professional team in the state. However, the Wyoming Cowboys and Cowgirls—particularly the football and basketball teams—are quite popular; their stadiums in Laramie are about 7,200 feet (2,200 m) above sea level, the highest in NCAA Division I. The Wyoming High School Activities Association also sponsors twelve sports and there are three junior ice hockey teams, all of which are members of the NA3HL. Casper has hosted the College National Finals Rodeo since 2001.\n### State symbols\nList of all Wyoming state symbols:\nState bird: western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) State coin: Sacagawea dollar State dinosaur: Triceratops State emblem: Bucking Horse and Rider State fish: cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) State flag: Flag of the State of Wyoming State flower: Wyoming Indian paintbrush (Castilleja linariifolia) State fossil: Knightia State gemstone: Wyoming nephrite jade State grass: western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii) State insect: Sheridan's green hairstreak butterfly (Callophrys sheridanii) State mammal: American bison (Bison bison) State motto: Equal Rights State nicknames: Equality State; Cowboy State; Big Wyoming State reptile: horned lizard (Phrynosoma douglassi brevirostre) State seal: Great Seal of the State of Wyoming State song: \"Wyoming\" by Charles E.

Wyoming became the 44th state of the union on July 10, 1890. It ranks 10th among the 50 U.S. states in terms of total area. It shares boundaries with six other Great Plains and Mountain states: Montana to the north and northwest, South Dakota and Nebraska to the east, Colorado to the south, Utah to the southwest, and Idaho to the west. Cheyenne, the capital, is located in the southeastern corner of the state.\nYellowstone River\nThe word Wyoming is derived from a Delaware word meaning “land of vast plains,” an apt description of the state’s spacious natural environment, which is home to nearly as many pronghorn as people. Wyoming’s residents are spread across the land in small ranching and farming towns, in mining settlements, and in communities offering unparalleled outdoor recreational opportunities. Each year millions of people visit Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. Moreover, the state has a low crime rate and little pollution. One of Wyoming’s nicknames is the Equality State, because it was the first state in the country to approve a constitution that included a provision granting women the right to vote.

The broad basins are synclines. The mountains dominating Wyoming’s horizon were formed during a period of mountain-building activity known as the Laramide orogeny, which affected the region from about 70 million to 40 million years ago. The land surface of Wyoming has a mean elevation of 6,700 feet (2,040 metres) above sea level, the highest of any state except Colorado. Three-fourths of Wyoming lies more than 1 mile (1.6 km) in elevation, and two-fifths exceeds 7,000 feet (2,100 metres). The state’s lowest point, at 3,125 feet (953 metres), lies in the channel of the Belle Fourche River as it flows from the state into South Dakota; its highest point, Gannett Peak, part of the Wind River Range in west-central Wyoming, reaches 13,804 feet (4,207 metres) in elevation.\nWyoming has six physiographic regions: the Black Hills; the Great Plains; the Southern, Middle, and Northern Rocky Mountains; and the Wyoming Basin. The Black Hills extend into South Dakota and are of generally low relief. Wyoming’s Great Plains region occupies the easternmost one-third of the state, gradually increasing in elevation from the state’s eastern border to the many mountain ranges that mark the region’s western margin.\nThe Southern Rocky Mountains extend from northeastern Colorado along the Laramie, Medicine Bow, and Sierra Madre ranges, making their farthest extension into Wyoming along the Laramie Range, where the mountain system terminates just south of the North Platte River near the city of Casper. The Northern Rocky Mountain region extends south from Canada across the states of Montana and Idaho and enters Wyoming at the northwestern corner of Yellowstone Park. The much larger Middle Rocky Mountain region occupies most of the northwestern quarter of the state, extending south along the Idaho-Wyoming border into Utah. Included in this region are the scenic Bighorn and Wind River mountain ranges, the geysers and fumaroles of Yellowstone Park, the igneous Absaroka Plateau on the park’s eastern margins, and Gannett Peak.\nThe Wyoming Basin borders the Continental Divide between the Southern and Middle Rocky Mountains and is composed of interspersed smaller mountains and intermontane basins. This region includes Flaming Gorge, created by the erosive action of the Green River, and the Great Divide Basin, which encloses an area of interior drainage with no outlet.\n## Drainage\nThe Continental Divide crosses Wyoming from the south-central portion of the state, trending northwest and leaving the state through Yellowstone National Park. Partly because of the presence of the divide, Wyoming contributes to the headwaters of four major North American drainage systems—the Colorado, Columbia, and Missouri rivers and the Great Salt Lake. The most significant of these to the state is the Missouri system, which drains approximately three-fourths of Wyoming’s land area. It is estimated that three-fourths of the state’s contributions to these drainage systems originate as snowmelt in Wyoming’s mountain ranges.\n## Soils\nWyoming’s several hundred soil types may be grouped into three broad categories determined largely on the basis of the state’s variable elevation and climatic zones. Varieties of mountain soils are found throughout the many ranges in Wyoming, with their greatest concentration in the northwest. These soils are frequently acidic and of limited value to commercial cropping, although they may support alpine meadows used for summer pasture and scattered forests used for timber products.\nThe southwestern to north-central portions of the state contain numerous varieties of desert soils that are frequently alkaline and used mostly for winter range, although others are suitable for agricultural crops when irrigated and sustain significant yields of grain. Plains soils, found in the eastern third of Wyoming, are of reasonable fertility and provide substantial forage for livestock; they also support moderate levels of dryland farming, including the production of wheat.\n## Relief\nWyoming featuresGrand Teton National Park: Teton RangeWyoming’s topography is dominated by several large basins and the ranges of the Rocky Mountains that border them.

{"name": "Low Countries", "documents": ["# Low Countries\nThe term Low Countries, also known as the Low Lands (Dutch: de Lage Landen, French: les Pays-Bas, Luxembourgish: déi Niddereg Lännereien) and historically called the Netherlands (Dutch: de Nederlanden), Flanders, or Belgica, is a coastal lowland region in Northwestern Europe forming the lower basin of the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta and consisting of three countries: Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Geographically and historically, the area also includes parts of France and Germany such as the French Flanders and the German regions of East Frisia and Cleves. During the Middle Ages, the Low Countries were divided into numerous semi-independent principalities.\nHistorically, the regions without access to the sea linked themselves politically and economically to those with access to form various unions of ports and hinterland, stretching inland as far as parts of the German Rhineland. Because of this, nowadays some parts of the Low Countries are hilly or elevated, including Luxembourg and the south of Belgium. Within the European Union, the region's political grouping is still referred to as the Benelux (short for Belgium-Netherlands-Luxembourg).\nDuring the Roman Empire, the region contained a militarised frontier and contact point between Rome and Germanic tribes. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Low Countries were the scene of the early independent trading centres that marked the reawakening of Europe in the 12th century. In that period, they rivalled northern Italy as one of the most densely populated regions of Western Europe. Guilds and councils governed most of the cities along with a figurehead ruler; interaction with their ruler was regulated by a strict set of rules describing what the latter could and could not expect. All of the regions mainly depended on trade, manufacturing and the encouragement of the free flow of goods and craftsmen. Dutch and French dialects were the main languages used in secular city life.\n## Terminology\nHistorically, the term Low Countries arose at the Court of the Dukes of Burgundy, who used the term les pays de par deçà (\"the lands over here\") for the Low Countries as opposed to les pays de par delà (\"the lands over there\") for the Duchy of Burgundy and the Free County of Burgundy, which were part of their realm but geographically disconnected from the Low Countries. Governor Mary of Hungary used both the expressions les pays de par deça and Pays d'Embas (\"lands down here\"), which evolved to Pays-Bas or Low Countries. Today the term is typically fitted to modern political boundaries and used in the same way as the term Benelux.\nThe name of the country of the Netherlands has the same etymology and origin as the name for the region Low Countries, due to \"nether\" meaning \"low\". In the Dutch language itself De Lage Landen is the modern term for Low Countries, and De Nederlanden (plural) is in use for the 16th century domains of Charles V, the historic Low Countries, while Nederland (singular) is the normal Dutch name for the country of the Netherlands. However, in official use, the name of the Dutch kingdom is still Kingdom of the Netherlands, Koninkrijk der Nederlanden (plural). This name derives from the 19th-century origins of the kingdom which originally included present-day Belgium.\nIn Dutch, and to a lesser extent in English, the Low Countries colloquially means the Netherlands and Belgium, sometimes the Netherlands and Flanders—the Dutch-speaking north of Belgium. For example, a Low Countries derby (Derby der Lage Landen), is a sports event between Belgium and the Netherlands.\nBelgium separated in 1830 from the (northern) Netherlands. The new country took its name from Belgica, the Latinised name for the Low Countries, as it was known during the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648). The Low Countries were in that war divided in two parts. On one hand, the northern Federated Netherlands or Belgica Foederata rebelled against King Philip II of Spain; on the other, the southern Royal Netherlands or Belgica Regia remained loyal to the Spanish king. This divide laid the early foundation for the later modern states of Belgium and the Netherlands.\n## History\nThe region politically had its origins in the Carolingian empire; more precisely, most of the people were within the Duchy of Lower Lotharingia. After the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia, the Low Countries were brought under the rule of various lordships until they came to be in the hands of the Valois Dukes of Burgundy. Hence, a large part of the Low Countries came to be referred to as the Burgundian Netherlands. After the reign of the Valois Dukes ended, much of the Low Countries were controlled by the House of Habsburg. This area was referred to as the Habsburg Netherlands, which was also called the Seventeen Provinces up to 1581. Even after the political secession of the autonomous Dutch Republic (or \"United Provinces\") in the north, the term \"Low Countries\" continued to be used to refer collectively to the region. The region was temporarily united politically between 1815 and 1839, as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, before this split into the three modern countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.\n### Early history\nThe Low Countries were part of the Roman provinces of Gallia Belgica and Germania Inferior. They were inhabited by Belgic and Germanic tribes. In the 4th and 5th century, Frankish tribes had entered this Roman region and came to run it increasingly independently. They came to be ruled by the Merovingian dynasty, under which dynasty the southern part (below the Rhine) was re-Christianised.\n### Frankish empire\nBy the end of the 8th century, the Low Countries formed a core part of a much expanded Francia and the Merovingians were replaced by the Carolingian dynasty. In 800, the Pope crowned and appointed Charlemagne Emperor of the re-established Roman Empire.\nAfter the death of Charlemagne, Francia was divided in three parts among his three grandsons. The middle slice, Middle Francia, was ruled by Lothair I, and thereby also came to be referred to as \"Lotharingia\" or \"Lorraine\". Apart from the original coastal County of Flanders, which was within West Francia, the rest of the Low Countries were within the lowland part of this, \"Lower Lorraine\".\nAfter the death of Lothair, the Low Countries were coveted by the rulers of both West Francia and East Francia. Each tried to swallow the region and to merge it with their spheres of influence. Thus, the Low Countries consisted of fiefs whose sovereignty resided with either the Kingdom of France or the Holy Roman Empire. While the further history the Low Countries can be seen as the object of a continual struggle between these two powers, the title of Duke of Lothier was coveted in the low countries for centuries.\n### Duchy of Burgundy\nIn the 14th and 15th century, separate fiefs came gradually to be ruled by a single family through royal intermarriage. This process culminated in the rule of the House of Valois, who were the rulers of the Duchy of Burgundy. At the height of Burgundian influence, the Low Countries became the political, cultural, and economic centre of Northern Europe, noted for its crafts and luxury goods, notably early Netherlandish painting, which is the work of artists who were active in the flourishing cities of Bruges, Ghent, Mechelen, Leuven, Tournai and Brussels, all in present-day Belgium. Musicians of the Franco-Flemish School were highly sought by the leading classes of all Europe.\n### Seventeen Provinces\nIn 1477 the Burgundian holdings in the area passed through an heiress—Mary of Burgundy—to the Habsburgs. Charles V, who inherited the territory in 1506, was named ruler by the States General and styled himself as Heer der Nederlanden (\"Lord of the Netherlands\"). He continued to rule the territories as a multitude of duchies and principalities until the Low Countries were eventually united into one indivisible territory, the Seventeen Provinces, covered by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, while retaining existing customs, laws, and forms of government within the provinces.\nThe Pragmatic Sanction transformed the agglomeration of lands into a unified entity, of which the Habsburgs would be the heirs. By streamlining the succession law in all Seventeen Provinces and declaring that all of them would be inherited by one heir, Charles effectively united the Netherlands as one entity. After Charles' abdication in 1555, the Seventeen Provinces passed to his son, Philip II of Spain.\n### Division\nThe Pragmatic Sanction is said to be one example of the Habsburg contest with particularism that contributed to the Dutch Revolt. Each of the provinces had its own laws, customs and political practices. The new policy, imposed from the outside, angered many inhabitants, who viewed their provinces as distinct entities. It and other monarchical acts, such as the creation of bishoprics and promulgation of laws against heresy, stoked resentments, which fired the eruption of the Dutch Revolt.\nAfter the northern Seven United Provinces of the seventeen declared their independence from Habsburg Spain in 1581, the ten provinces of the Southern Netherlands remained occupied by the Army of Flanders under Spanish service and are therefore sometimes called the Spanish Netherlands. In 1713, under the Treaty of Utrecht following the War of the Spanish Succession, what was left of the Spanish Netherlands was ceded to Austria and thus became known as the Austrian Netherlands.\nKenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer defending the walls during the Siege of Haarlem (1572–1573) Sack of Maastricht by the Tercios de Flandes (Flemish Regiments) in 1579 Siege and capture of Tournai (1581) Map of Ostend during the siege in 1601\n### Late Modern Period\nThe United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815–1830) temporarily united the Low Countries again before it split into the three modern countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.\nDuring the early months of World War I (around 1914), the Central Powers invaded the Low Countries of Luxembourg and Belgium in what has been come to be known as the German invasion of Belgium. It led to the German occupation of the two countries. However, the German advance into France was quickly halted, causing a military stalemate for most of the war. In the end, a total of approximately 56,000 people were killed in the invasion.\nWorld War II started in this region, when Adolf Hitler's gaze turned his strategy west toward France. The Low Countries were an easy route around the imposing French Maginot Line. He ordered a conquest of the Low Countries with the shortest possible notice, to forestall the French, and prevent Allied air power from threatening the strategic Ruhr Area of Germany. It would also provide the basis for a long-term air and sea campaign against Britain. As much as possible of the border areas in northern France should be occupied. Germany's Blitzkrieg tactics rapidly overpowered the defences of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.\nAll three countries were occupied from May 1940 until early 1945. During the occupation, their governments were forced into exiled in Britain. In 1944, they signed the London Customs Convention, laying the foundation for the eventual Benelux Economic Union, an important forerunner of the EEC (later the EU).\n## Literature\nOne of the Low Countries' earliest literary figures is the blind poet Bernlef, from c. 800, who sang both Christian psalms and pagan verses. Bernlef is representative of the coexistence of Christianity and Germanic polytheism in this time period.: 1–2 \nThe earliest examples of written literature include the Wachtendonck Psalms, a collection of twenty five psalms that originated in the Moselle-Frankish region around the middle of the 9th century.: 3"], "selected_questions": ["What were the main languages used in secular city life in the Low Countries?", "Which family came to rule the Low Countries in the 14th and 15th century?", "What did the Pragmatic Sanction do in relation to the Low Countries?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The main languages used in secular city life in the Low Countries were Dutch and French dialects.", "The House of Valois came to rule the Low Countries in the 14th and 15th century.", "The Pragmatic Sanction transformed the fragmented lands of the Low Countries into a unified entity known as the Seventeen Provinces.

{"name": "Mediterranean Sea", "documents": ["# Mediterranean Sea\nThe Mediterranean Sea is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Western and Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The Sea has played a central role in the history of Western civilization. Although the Mediterranean is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, it is usually referred to as a separate body of water. Geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago, the Mediterranean was cut off from the Atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years during the Messinian salinity crisis before being refilled by the Zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago.\nThe Mediterranean Sea covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 (970,000 sq mi), representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface, but its connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar—the narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates the Iberian Peninsula in Europe from Morocco in Africa—is only 14 km (9 mi) wide. In oceanography, it is sometimes called the Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea, the European Mediterranean Sea or the African Mediterranean Sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere. The Mediterranean Sea encompasses a vast number of islands, some of them being of volcanic origin. The two by far largest islands are Sicily and Sardinia.\nThe Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m (4,900 ft) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m (17,280 ft) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea. It lies between latitudes 30° and 46° N and longitudes 6° W and 36° E. Its west–east length, from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Gulf of Iskenderun, on the southeastern coast of Turkey, is about 4,000 kilometres (2,500 mi). The north–south length varies greatly between different shorelines and whether only straight routes are considered. Also including longitudal changes, the shortest shipping route between the multinational Gulf of Trieste and the Libyan coastline of Gulf of Sidra is about 1,900 kilometres (1,200 mi). The water temperatures are mild in winter and warm in summer and give name to the mediterranean climate type due to the majority of precipitation falling in the cooler months. Its southern and eastern coastlines are lined with hot deserts not far inland, but the immediate coastline on all sides of the Mediterranean tends to have strong maritime moderation.\nThe sea was an important route for merchants and travelers of ancient times, facilitating trade and cultural exchange between peoples of the region. The history of the Mediterranean region is crucial to understanding the origins and development of many modern societies. The Roman Empire maintained nautical hegemony over the sea for centuries.\nThe countries surrounding the Mediterranean in clockwise order are Spain, France, Monaco, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco; Malta and Cyprus are island countries in the sea. In addition, the disputed territory of North Cyprus, and some enclaves, notably Gibraltar and Ceuta, have coastlines on the sea. Alexandria is the largest coastal settlement. The drainage basin encompasses a large number of other countries, the Nile being the longest river ending in the Mediterranean Sea.\n## History\n### Ancient civilizations\nSome of the world's greatest ancient civilizations that were the base of the entire Western culture were located around the Mediterranean shores and were greatly influenced by their proximity to the sea. It provided routes for trade, colonization, and war, as well as food (from fishing and the gathering of other seafood) for numerous communities throughout the ages.\nDue to the shared climate, geology, and access to the sea, cultures centered on the Mediterranean tended to have some extent of intertwined culture and history.\nThe most notable Mediterranean civilizations in classical antiquity were the Greek city states, Persians and the Phoenicians, both of which extensively colonized the coastlines of the Mediterranean. Later, when Augustus founded the Roman Empire, the Romans referred to the Mediterranean as Mare Nostrum (\"Our Sea\"). For the next 400 years, the Roman Empire completely controlled the Mediterranean Sea and virtually all its coastal regions from Gibraltar to the Levant.\nDarius I of Persia, who conquered Ancient Egypt, built a canal linking the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. Darius's canal was wide enough for two triremes to pass each other with oars extended, and required four days to traverse.\nIn 2019, the archaeological team of experts from Underwater Research Center of the Akdeniz University (UA) revealed a shipwreck dating back 3,600 years in the Mediterranean Sea in Turkey. 1.5 tons of copper ingots found in the ship were used to estimate its age. The Governor of Antalya Munir Karaloğlu described this valuable discovery as the \"Göbeklitepe of the underwater world”. It has been confirmed that the shipwreck, dating back to 1600 BC, is older than the \"Uluburun Shipwreck\" dating back to 1400 BC.\n### Middle Ages and empires\nThe Western Roman Empire collapsed around 476 AD. Temporarily the east was again dominant as Roman power lived on in the Byzantine Empire formed in the 4th century from the eastern half of the Roman Empire. Another power arose in the 7th century, and with it the religion of Islam, which soon swept across from the east; at its greatest extent, the Arabs, under the Umayyads, controlled most of the Mediterranean region and left a lasting footprint on its eastern and southern shores.\nThe Arab invasions disrupted the trade relations between Western and Eastern Europe while disrupting trade routes with Eastern Asian Empires. This, however, had the indirect effect of promoting the trade across the Caspian Sea. The export of grains from Egypt was re-routed towards the Eastern world. Products from East Asian empires, like silk and spices, were carried from Egypt to ports like Venice and Constantinople by sailors and Jewish merchants. The Viking raids further disrupted the trade in western Europe and brought it to a halt. However, the Norsemen developed the trade from Norway to the White Sea, while also trading in luxury goods from Spain and the Mediterranean. The Byzantines in the mid-8th century retook control of the area around the north-eastern part of the Mediterranean. Venetian ships from the 9th century armed themselves to counter the harassment by Arabs while concentrating trade of Asian goods in Venice.\nThe Fatimids maintained trade relations with the Italian city-states like Amalfi and Genoa before the Crusades, according to the Cairo Geniza documents. A document dated 996 mentions Amalfian merchants living in Cairo. Another letter states that the Genoese had traded with Alexandria. The caliph al-Mustansir had allowed Amalfian merchants to reside in Jerusalem about 1060 in place of the Latin hospice.\nThe Crusades led to flourishing of trade between Europe and the outremer region. Genoa, Venice and Pisa created colonies in regions controlled by the Crusaders and came to control the trade with the Orient. These colonies also allowed them to trade with the Eastern world. Though the fall of the Crusader states and attempts at banning of trade relations with Muslim states by the Popes temporarily disrupted the trade with the Orient, it however continued.\nEurope started to revive, however, as more organized and centralized states began to form in the later Middle Ages after the Renaissance of the 12th century.\nOttoman power based in Anatolia continued to grow, and in 1453 extinguished the Byzantine Empire with the Conquest of Constantinople. Ottomans gained control of much of the sea in the 16th century and maintained naval bases in southern France (1543–1544), Algeria and Tunisia. Barbarossa, the famous Ottoman captain is a symbol of this domination with the victory of the Battle of Preveza (1538). The Battle of Djerba (1560) marked the apex of Ottoman naval domination in the Mediterranean. As the naval prowess of the European powers increased, they confronted Ottoman expansion in the region when the Battle of Lepanto (1571) checked the power of the Ottoman Navy. This was the last naval battle to be fought primarily between galleys.\nThe Barbary pirates of Northwest Africa preyed on Christian shipping and coastlines in the Western Mediterranean Sea. According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th centuries, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million Europeans as slaves.\nThe development of oceanic shipping began to affect the entire Mediterranean. Once, most of the trade between Western Europe and the East was passing through the region, but after the 1490s the development of a sea route to the Indian Ocean allowed the importation of Asian spices and other goods through the Atlantic ports of western Europe.\nThe sea remained strategically important. British mastery of Gibraltar ensured their influence in Africa and Southwest Asia. Especially after the naval battles of Abukir (1799, Battle of the Nile) and Trafalgar (1805), the British had for a long time strengthened their dominance in the Mediterranean. Wars included Naval warfare in the Mediterranean during World War I and Mediterranean theatre of World War II.\nWith the opening of the lockless Suez Canal in 1869, the flow of trade between Europe and Asia changed fundamentally. The fastest route now led through the Mediterranean towards East Africa and Asia. This led to a preference for the Mediterranean countries and their ports like Trieste with the direct connections to Central and Eastern Europe experienced a rapid economic rise. In the 20th century, the 1st and 2nd World War as well as the Suez Crisis and the Cold War led to a shift of trade routes to the European northern ports, which changed again towards the southern ports through European integration, the activation of the Silk Road and free world trade.\n### 21st century and migrations\nIn 2013, the Maltese president described the Mediterranean Sea as a \"cemetery\" due to the large number of migrants who drowned there after their boats capsized. European Parliament president Martin Schulz said in 2014 that Europe's migration policy \"turned the Mediterranean into a graveyard\", referring to the number of drowned refugees in the region as a direct result of the policies. An Azerbaijani official described the sea as \"a burial ground ... where people die\".\nFollowing the 2013 Lampedusa migrant shipwreck, the Italian government decided to strengthen the national system for the patrolling of the Mediterranean Sea by authorising \"Operation Mare Nostrum\", a military and humanitarian mission in order to rescue the migrants and arrest the traffickers of immigrants. In 2015, more than one million migrants crossed the Mediterranean Sea into Europe.\nItaly was particularly affected by the European migrant crisis. Since 2013, over 700,000 migrants have landed in Italy, mainly sub-Saharan Africans.\n## Geography\nThe Mediterranean Sea connects:\nto the Atlantic Ocean by the Strait of Gibraltar (known in Homer's writings as the \"Pillars of Hercules\") in the west to the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea, by the Straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosporus respectively, in the east\nThe 163 km (101 mi) long artificial Suez Canal in the southeast connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea without ship lock, because the water level is essentially the same.\nThe westernmost point of the Mediterranean is located at the transition from the Alborán Sea to the Strait of Gibraltar, the easternmost point is on the coast of the Gulf of Iskenderun in southeastern Turkey. The northernmost point of the Mediterranean is on the coast of the Gulf of Trieste near Monfalcone in northern Italy while the southernmost point is on the coast of the Gulf of Sidra near the Libyan town of El Agheila.\nLarge islands in the Mediterranean include:\nCyprus, Crete, Euboea, Rhodes, Lesbos, Chios, Kefalonia, Corfu, Limnos, Samos, Naxos, and Andros in the Eastern Mediterranean Sicily, Cres, Krk, Brač, Hvar, Pag, Korčula, and Malta in the central Mediterranean Sardinia, Corsica, and the Balearic Islands: Ibiza, Majorca, and Menorca in the Western Mediterranean\nThe Alpine arc, which also has a great meteorological impact on the Mediterranean area, touches the Mediterranean in the west in the area around Nice.\nThe typical Mediterranean climate has hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Crops of the region include olives, grapes, oranges, tangerines, carobs and cork.\n### Marginal seas\nThe Mediterranean Sea includes 15 marginal seas:\nList of seas Category:Marginal seas of the Mediterranean Category:Gulfs of the Mediterranean Category:Straits of the Mediterranean Sea Category:Channels of the Mediterranean Sea\nNote 1: The International Hydrographic Organization defines the area as generic Mediterranean Sea, in the Western Basin. It does not recognize the label Sea of Sardinia.\nNote 2: Thracian Sea and Myrtoan Sea are seas that are part of the Aegean Sea.\nNote 3: The Black Sea is not considered part of it.\n### Extent\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Mediterranean Sea as follows: Stretching from the Strait of Gibraltar in the west to the entrances to the Dardanelles and the Suez Canal in the east, the Mediterranean Sea is bounded by the coasts of Europe, Africa, and Asia and is divided into two deep basins:\nWestern Basin: On the west: A line joining the extremities of Cape Trafalgar (Spain) and Cape Spartel (Africa) On the northeast: The west coast of Italy. In the Strait of Messina, a line joining the north extreme of Cape Paci (15°42′E) with Cape Peloro, the east extreme of the Island of Sicily. The north coast of Sicily On the east: A line joining Cape Lilibeo the western point of Sicily (37°47′N 12°22′E﻿ / ﻿37.783°N 12.367°E﻿ / 37.783; 12.367), through the Adventure Bank to Cape Bon (Tunisia) Eastern Basin: On the west: The northeastern and eastern limits of the Western Basin On the northeast: A line joining Kum Kale (26°11′E) and Cape Helles, the western entrance to the Dardanelles On the southeast: The entrance to the Suez Canal On the east: The coasts of Lebanon, Syria, and Israel\n### Hydrography\nThe drainage basin of the Mediterranean Sea is particularly heterogeneous and extends much further than the Mediterranean region. Its size has been estimated between 4,000,000 km2 (1,500,000 sq mi) and 5,500,000 km2 (2,100,000 sq mi), depending on whether non-active parts (deserts) are included or not. The longest river ending in the Mediterranean Sea is the Nile, which takes its sources in equatorial Africa. The basin of the Nile constitutes about two-thirds of the Mediterranean drainage basin and encompasses areas as high as the Ruwenzori Mountains. Among other important rivers in Africa, are the Moulouya and the Chelif, both on the north side of the Atlas Mountains. In Asia, are the Ceyhan and Seyhan, both on the south side of the Taurus Mountains. In Europe, the largest basins are those of the Rhône, Ebro, Po, and Maritsa. The basin of the Rhône is the largest and extends up as far north as the Jura Mountains, encompassing areas even on the north side of the Alps. The basins of the Ebro, Po, and Maritsa, are respectively south of the Pyrenees, Alps, and Balkan Mountains, which are the major ranges bordering Southern Europe.\nTotal annual precipitation is significantly higher on the European part of the Mediterranean basin, especially near the Alps (the 'water tower of Europe') and other high mountain ranges. As a consequence, the river discharges of the Rhône and Po are similar to that of the Nile, despite the latter having a much larger basin. These are the only three rivers with an average discharge of over 1,000 m3/s (35,000 cu ft/s). Among large natural fresh bodies of water are Lake Victoria (Nile basin), Lake Geneva (Rhône), and the Italian Lakes (Po). While the Mediterranean watershed is bordered by other river basins in Europe, it is essentially bordered by endorheic basins or deserts elsewhere.\nThe following countries are in the Mediterranean drainage basin while not having a coastline on the Mediterranean Sea:\nIn Europe, through various rivers: Andorra, Bulgaria, Kosovo, North Macedonia, San Marino, Serbia, and Switzerland. In Africa, through the Nile: Congo, Burundi, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.\n### Coastal countries\nThe following countries have a coastline on the Mediterranean Sea:\nNorthern shore (from west to east): Spain, France, Monaco, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Greece, Turkey. Eastern shore (from north to south): Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Egypt. Southern shore (from west to east): Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt. Island nations: Malta, Cyprus.\nSeveral other territories also border the Mediterranean Sea (from west to east):\nthe British overseas territory of Gibraltar the Spanish autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla and nearby islands the Sovereign Base Areas on Cyprus the Palestinian Gaza Strip\n### Exclusive economic zone\nExclusive economic zones in Mediterranean Sea:\n### Coastline length\nThe Coastline length is about 46,000 km.\n### Coastal cities\nMajor cities (municipalities), with populations larger than 200,000 people, bordering the Mediterranean Sea include:\nAlgeria: Algiers, Annaba, Oran Egypt: Alexandria, Damietta, Port Said France: Marseille, Toulon, Nice Greece: Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras, Heraklion Israel: Ashdod, Haifa, Netanya, Rishon LeZion, Tel Aviv Italy: Bari, Catania, Genoa, Messina, Naples, Palermo, Rome, Taranto, Trieste, Venice Lebanon: Beirut, Tripoli Libya: Benghazi, Misrata, Tripoli, Zawiya, Zliten Malta: Valletta Morocco: Tétouan, Tangier Palestine: Gaza City Spain: Alicante, Almería, Badalona, Barcelona, Cartagena, Málaga, Palma de Mallorca, Valencia. Syria: Latakia, Tartus Tunisia: Sfax, Sousse, Tunis Turkey: Alanya, Antalya, Çanakkale, İskenderun, İzmir, Mersin\n### Subdivisions\nThe International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) divides the Mediterranean into a number of smaller waterbodies, each with their own designation (from west to east):\nthe Strait of Gibraltar the Alboran Sea, between Spain and Morocco the Balearic Sea, between mainland Spain and its Balearic Islands the Ligurian Sea between Corsica and Liguria (Italy) the Tyrrhenian Sea enclosed by Sardinia, Italian peninsula and Sicily the Ionian Sea between Italy, Albania and Greece the Adriatic Sea between Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Albania the Aegean Sea between Greece and Turkey\n#### Other seas\nSome other seas whose names have been in common use from the ancient times, or in the present:\nthe Sea of Sardinia, between Sardinia and Balearic Islands, as a part of the Balearic Sea the Sea of Sicily between Sicily and Tunisia the Libyan Sea between Libya and Crete In the Aegean Sea, the Thracian Sea in its north the Myrtoan Sea between the Cyclades and the Peloponnese the Sea of Crete north of Crete the Icarian Sea between Kos and Chios the Cilician Sea between Turkey and Cyprus the Levantine Sea at the eastern end of the Mediterranean\nMany of these smaller seas feature in local myth and folklore and derive their names from such associations.\n#### Other features\nIn addition to the seas, a number of gulfs and straits are recognised:\nthe Saint George Bay in Beirut, Lebanon the Ras Ibn Hani cape in Latakia, Syria the Ras al-Bassit cape in northern Syria. the Minet el-Beida (\"White Harbour\") bay near ancient Ugarit, Syria the Strait of Gibraltar, connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Spain from Morocco the Bay of Algeciras, at the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula the Gulf of Corinth, an enclosed sea between the Ionian Sea and the Corinth Canal the Pagasetic Gulf, the gulf of Volos, south of the Thermaic Gulf, formed by the Mount Pelion peninsula the Saronic Gulf, the gulf of Athens, between the Corinth Canal and the Mirtoan Sea the Thermaic Gulf, the gulf of Thessaloniki, located in the northern Greek region of Macedonia the Kvarner Gulf, Croatia the Gulf of Almeria, southeast of Spain the Gulf of Lion, south of France the Gulf of Valencia, east of Spain the Strait of Messina, between Sicily and Calabrian peninsula the Gulf of Genoa, northwestern Italy the Gulf of Venice, northeastern Italy the Gulf of Trieste, northeastern Italy the Gulf of Taranto, southern Italy the Gulf of Saint Euphemia, southern Italy, with the international airport nearby the Gulf of Salerno, southwestern Italy the Gulf of Gaeta, southwestern Italy the Gulf of Squillace, southern Italy the Strait of Otranto, between Italy and Albania the Gulf of Haifa, northern Israel the Gulf of Sidra, between Tripolitania (western Libya) and Cyrenaica (eastern Libya) the Strait of Sicily, between Sicily and Tunisia the Corsica Channel, between Corsica and Italy the Strait of Bonifacio, between Sardinia and Corsica the Gulf of Antalya, between west and east shores of Antalya (Turkey) the Gulf of İskenderun, between İskenderun and Adana (Turkey) the Gulf of İzmir, in İzmir (Turkey) the Gulf of Fethiye, in Fethiye (Turkey) the Gulf of Kuşadası, in İzmir (Turkey) the Bay of Kotor, in south-western Montenegro and south-eastern Croatia the Malta Channel, between Sicily and Malta the Gozo Channel, between Malta Island and Gozo\n### Largest islands\nThe Mediterranean Sea encompasses about 10,000 islands and islets, of which about 250 are permanently inhabited. In the table below are listed the ten largest by size.\n### Climate\nMuch of the Mediterranean coast enjoys a hot-summer Mediterranean climate. However, most of its southeastern coast has a hot desert climate, and much of Spain's eastern (Mediterranean) coast has a cold semi-arid climate, while most of Italy's northern (Adriatic) coast has a humid subtropical climate. Although they are rare, tropical cyclones occasionally form in the Mediterranean Sea, typically in September–November.\n## Oceanography\nBeing nearly landlocked affects conditions in the Mediterranean Sea: for instance, tides are very limited as a result of the narrow connection with the Atlantic Ocean. The Mediterranean is characterised and immediately recognised by its deep blue colour.\nEvaporation greatly exceeds precipitation and river runoff in the Mediterranean, a fact that is central to the water circulation within the basin. Evaporation is especially high in its eastern half, causing the water level to decrease and salinity to increase eastward. The average salinity in the basin is 38 PSU at 5 m depth. The temperature of the water in the deepest part of the Mediterranean Sea is 13.2 °C (55.8 °F).\nThe net water influx from the Atlantic Ocean is ca. 70,000 m³/s or 2.2×1012 m3/a (7.8×1013 cu ft/a). Without this Atlantic water, the sea level of the Mediterranean Sea would fall at a rate of about 1 m per year.\n### General circulation\nWater circulation in the Mediterranean can be attributed to the surface waters entering from the Atlantic through the Strait of Gibraltar (and also low salinity water entering the Mediterranean from the Black Sea through the Bosphorus). The cool and relatively low-salinity Atlantic water circulates eastwards along the North African coasts. A part of the surface water does not pass the Strait of Sicily, but deviates towards Corsica before exiting the Mediterranean. The surface waters entering the eastern Mediterranean basin circulate along the Libyan and Israeli coasts. Upon reaching the Levantine Sea, the surface waters having warmed and increased its salinity from its initial Atlantic state, is now denser and sinks to form the Levantine Intermediate Waters (LIW). Most of the water found anywhere between 50 and 600 m deep in the Mediterranean originates from the LIW. LIW are formed along the coasts of Turkey and circulate westwards along the Greek and South Italian coasts. LIW are the only waters passing the Sicily Strait westwards. After the Strait of Sicily, the LIW waters circulate along the Italian, French and Spanish coasts before exiting the Mediterranean through the depths of the Strait of Gibraltar. Deep water in the Mediterranean originates from three main areas: the Adriatic Sea, from which most of the deep water in the eastern Mediterranean originates, the Aegean Sea, and the Gulf of Lion. Deep water formation in the Mediterranean is triggered by strong winter convection fueled by intense cold winds like the Bora. When new deep water is formed, the older waters mix with the overlaying intermediate waters and eventually exit the Mediterranean. The residence time of water in the Mediterranean is approximately 100 years, making the Mediterranean especially sensitive to climate change.\n### Other events affecting water circulation\nBeing a semi-enclosed basin, the Mediterranean experiences transitory events that can affect the water circulation on short time scales. In the mid-1990s, the Aegean Sea became the main area for deep water formation in the eastern Mediterranean after particularly cold winter conditions. This transitory switch in the origin of deep waters in the eastern Mediterranean was termed Eastern Mediterranean Transient (EMT) and had major consequences on water circulation of the Mediterranean.\nAnother example of a transient event affecting the Mediterranean circulation is the periodic inversion of the North Ionian Gyre, which is an anticyclonic ocean gyre observed in the northern part of the Ionian Sea, off the Greek coast. The transition from anticyclonic to cyclonic rotation of this gyre changes the origin of the waters fueling it; when the circulation is anticyclonic (most common), the waters of the gyre originate from the Adriatic Sea. When the circulation is cyclonic, the waters originate from the Levantine Sea. These waters have different physical and chemical characteristics, and the periodic inversion of the North Ionian Gyre (called Bimodal Oscillating System or BiOS) changes the Mediterranean circulation and biogeochemistry around the Adriatic and Levantine regions.\n### Climate change\nBecause of the short residence time of waters, the Mediterranean Sea is considered a hot-spot for climate change effects. Deep water temperatures have increased by 0.12 °C (0.22 °F) between 1959 and 1989. According to climate projections, the Mediterranean Sea could become warmer. The decrease in precipitation over the region could lead to more evaporation ultimately increasing the Mediterranean Sea salinity. Because of the changes in temperature and salinity, the Mediterranean Sea may become more stratified by the end of the 21st century, with notable consequences on water circulation and biogeochemistry. The stratification and warming have already led to the eastern Mediterranean to become a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere  notably during summer. This strong summer degassing, combined with the prolonged and pronounced stratification results in the formation of aragonite crystals abiotically in the water column. The cumulative warming at the surface of the Mediterranean has a significant impact on the ecological system. Extreme warming has led to biodiversity loss  and presents an existential threat to some habitats  while making conditions more hospitable to invasive tropical species.\n## Biogeochemistry\nIn spite of its great biodiversity, concentrations of chlorophyll and nutrients in the Mediterranean Sea are very low, making it one of the most oligotrophic ocean regions in the world. The Mediterranean Sea is commonly referred to as an LNLC (Low-Nutrient, Low-Chlorophyll) area. The Mediterranean Sea fits the definition of a desert in which its nutrient contents are low, making it difficult for plants and animals to develop.\nThere are steep gradients in nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll concentrations and primary productivity in the Mediterranean. Nutrient concentrations in the western part of the basin are about double the concentrations in the eastern basin. The Alboran Sea, close to the Strait of Gibraltar, has a daily primary productivity of about 0.25 g C (grams of carbon) m−2 day−1 whereas the eastern basin has an average daily productivity of 0.16 g C m−2 day−1. For this reason, the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea is termed \"ultraoligotrophic\". The productive areas of the Mediterranean Sea are few and small. High (i.e. more than 0.5 grams of Chlorophyll a per cubic meter) productivity occurs in coastal areas, close to the river mouths which are the primary suppliers of dissolved nutrients. The Gulf of Lion has a relatively high productivity because it is an area of high vertical mixing, bringing nutrients to the surface waters that can be used by phytoplankton to produce Chlorophyll a.\nPrimary productivity in the Mediterranean is also marked by an intense seasonal variability. In winter, the strong winds and precipitation over the basin generate vertical mixing, bringing nutrients from the deep waters to the surface, where phytoplankton can convert it into biomass. However, in winter, light may be the limiting factor for primary productivity. Between March and April, spring offers the ideal trade-off between light intensity and nutrient concentrations in surface for a spring bloom to occur. In summer, high atmospheric temperatures lead to the warming of the surface waters. The resulting density difference virtually isolates the surface waters from the rest of the water column and nutrient exchanges are limited. As a consequence, primary productivity is very low between June and October.\nOceanographic expeditions uncovered a characteristic feature of the Mediterranean Sea biogeochemistry: most of the chlorophyll production does not occur on the surface, but in sub-surface waters between 80 and 200 meters deep. Another key characteristic of the Mediterranean is its high nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio (N:P). Redfield demonstrated that most of the world's oceans have an average N:P ratio around 16. However, the Mediterranean Sea has an average N:P between 24 and 29, which translates a widespread phosphorus limitation.\nBecause of its low productivity, plankton assemblages in the Mediterranean Sea are dominated by small organisms such as picophytoplankton and bacteria.\n## Geology\nThe geologic history of the Mediterranean Sea is complex. Underlain by oceanic crust, the sea basin was once thought to be a tectonic remnant of the ancient Tethys Ocean; it is now known to be a structurally younger basin, called the Neotethys, which was first formed by the convergence of the African and Eurasian plates during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic. Because it is a near-landlocked body of water in a normally dry climate, the Mediterranean is subject to intensive evaporation and the precipitation of evaporites. The Messinian salinity crisis started about six million years ago (mya) when the Mediterranean became landlocked, and then essentially dried up. There are salt deposits accumulated on the bottom of the basin of more than a million cubic kilometres—in some places more than three kilometres thick.\nScientists estimate that the sea was last filled about 5.3 million years ago (mya) in less than two years by the Zanclean flood. Water poured in from the Atlantic Ocean through a newly breached gateway now called the Strait of Gibraltar at an estimated rate of about three orders of magnitude (one thousand times) larger than the current flow of the Amazon River.\nThe Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of 1,500 m (4,900 ft) and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m (17,280 ft) in the Calypso Deep in the Ionian Sea. The coastline extends for 46,000 km (29,000 mi). A shallow submarine ridge (the Strait of Sicily) between the island of Sicily and the coast of Tunisia divides the sea in two main subregions: the Western Mediterranean, with an area of about 850,000 km2 (330,000 mi2); and the Eastern Mediterranean, of about 1.65 million km2 (640,000 mi2). Coastal areas have submarine karst springs or vruljas, which discharge pressurised groundwater into the water from below the surface; the discharge water is usually fresh, and sometimes may be thermal.\n### Tectonics and paleoenvironmental analysis\nThe Mediterranean basin and sea system were established by the ancient African-Arabian continent colliding with the Eurasian continent. As Africa-Arabia drifted northward, it closed over the ancient Tethys Ocean which had earlier separated the two supercontinents Laurasia and Gondwana. At about that time in the middle Jurassic period (roughly 170 million years ago) a much smaller sea basin, dubbed the Neotethys, was formed shortly before the Tethys Ocean closed at its western (Arabian) end. The broad line of collisions pushed up a very long system of mountains from the Pyrenees in Spain to the Zagros Mountains in Iran in an episode of mountain-building tectonics known as the Alpine orogeny. The Neotethys grew larger during the episodes of collisions (and associated foldings and subductions) that occurred during the Oligocene and Miocene epochs (34 to 5.33 mya); see animation: Africa-Arabia colliding with Eurasia. Accordingly, the Mediterranean basin consists of several stretched tectonic plates in subduction which are the foundation of the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea. Various zones of subduction contain the highest oceanic ridges, east of the Ionian Sea and south of the Aegean. The Central Indian Ridge runs east of the Mediterranean Sea south-east across the in-between of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula into the Indian Ocean.\n#### Messinian salinity crisis\nDuring Mesozoic and Cenozoic times, as the northwest corner of Africa converged on Iberia, it lifted the Betic-Rif mountain belts across southern Iberia and northwest Africa. There the development of the intramontane Betic and Rif basins created two roughly parallel marine gateways between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Dubbed the Betic and Rifian corridors, they gradually closed during the middle and late Miocene: perhaps several times. In the late Miocene the closure of the Betic Corridor triggered the so-called \"Messinian salinity crisis\" (MSC), characterized by the deposition of a thick evaporitic sequence - with salt deposits up to 2 km thick in the Levantine sea - and by a massive drop in water level in much of the Basin. This event was for long the subject of acute scientific controversy, now much appeased, regarding its sequence, geographic range, processes leading to evaporite facies and salt deposits. The start of the MSC was recently estimated astronomically at 5.96 mya, and it persisted for some 630,000 years until about 5.3 mya; see Animation: Messinian salinity crisis, at right.\nAfter the initial drawdown and re-flooding, there followed more episodes—the total number is debated—of sea drawdowns and re-floodings for the duration of the MSC. It ended when the Atlantic Ocean last re-flooded the basin—creating the Strait of Gibraltar and causing the Zanclean flood—at the end of the Miocene (5.33 mya). Some research has suggested that a desiccation-flooding-desiccation cycle may have repeated several times, which could explain several events of large amounts of salt deposition. Recent studies, however, show that repeated desiccation and re-flooding is unlikely from a geodynamic point of view.\n#### Desiccation and exchanges of flora and fauna\nThe present-day Atlantic gateway, the Strait of Gibraltar, originated in the early Pliocene via the Zanclean Flood. As mentioned, there were two earlier gateways: the Betic Corridor across southern Spain and the Rifian Corridor across northern Morocco. The Betic closed about 6 mya, causing the Messinian salinity crisis (MSC); the Rifian or possibly both gateways closed during the earlier Tortonian times, causing a \"Tortonian salinity crisis\" (from 11.6 to 7.2 mya), long before the MSC and lasting much longer. Both \"crises\" resulted in broad connections between the mainlands of Africa and Europe, which allowed migrations of flora and fauna—especially large mammals including primates—between the two continents. The Vallesian crisis indicates a typical extinction and replacement of mammal species in Europe during Tortonian times following climatic upheaval and overland migrations of new species: see Animation: Messinian salinity crisis (and mammal migrations), at right.\nThe almost complete enclosure of the Mediterranean basin has enabled the oceanic gateways to dominate seawater circulation and the environmental evolution of the sea and basin. Circulation patterns are also affected by several other factors—including climate, bathymetry, and water chemistry and temperature—which are interactive and can induce precipitation of evaporites. Deposits of evaporites accumulated earlier in the nearby Carpathian foredeep during the Middle Miocene, and the adjacent Red Sea Basin (during the Late Miocene), and in the whole Mediterranean basin (during the MSC and the Messinian age). Many diatomites are found underneath the evaporite deposits, suggesting a connection between their formations.\nToday, evaporation of surface seawater (output) is more than the supply (input) of fresh water by precipitation and coastal drainage systems, causing the salinity of the Mediterranean to be much higher than that of the Atlantic—so much so that the saltier Mediterranean waters sink below the waters incoming from the Atlantic, causing a two-layer flow across the Strait of Gibraltar: that is, an outflow submarine current of warm saline Mediterranean water, counterbalanced by an inflow surface current of less saline cold oceanic water from the Atlantic. In the 1920s, Herman Sörgel proposed the building of a hydroelectric dam (the Atlantropa project) across the Straits, using the inflow current to provide a large amount of hydroelectric energy. The underlying energy grid was also intended to support a political union between Europe and, at least, the Maghreb part of Africa (compare Eurafrika for the later impact and Desertec for a later project with some parallels in the planned grid).\n#### Shift to a \"Mediterranean climate\"\nThe end of the Miocene also marked a change in the climate of the Mediterranean basin. Fossil evidence from that period reveals that the larger basin had a humid subtropical climate with rainfall in the summer supporting laurel forests. The shift to a \"Mediterranean climate\" occurred largely within the last three million years (the late Pliocene epoch) as summer rainfall decreased. The subtropical laurel forests retreated; and even as they persisted on the islands of Macaronesia off the Atlantic coast of Iberia and North Africa, the present Mediterranean vegetation evolved, dominated by coniferous trees and sclerophyllous trees and shrubs with small, hard, waxy leaves that prevent moisture loss in the dry summers. Much of these forests and shrublands have been altered beyond recognition by thousands of years of human habitation. There are now very few relatively intact natural areas in what was once a heavily wooded region.\n## Paleoclimate\nBecause of its latitude and its landlocked position, the Mediterranean is especially sensitive to astronomically induced climatic variations, which are well documented in its sedimentary record. Since the Mediterranean is subject to the deposition of eolian dust from the Sahara during dry periods, whereas riverine detrital input prevails during wet ones, the Mediterranean marine sapropel-bearing sequences provide high-resolution climatic information. These data have been employed in reconstructing astronomically calibrated time scales for the last 9 Ma of the Earth's history, helping to constrain the time of past geomagnetic reversals. Furthermore, the exceptional accuracy of these paleoclimatic records has improved our knowledge of the Earth's orbital variations in the past.\n## Biodiversity\nUnlike the vast multidirectional ocean currents in open oceans within their respective oceanic zones; biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea is that of a stable one due to the subtle but strong locked nature of currents which affects favourably, even the smallest macroscopic type of volcanic life form. The stable marine ecosystem of the Mediterranean Sea and sea temperature provides a nourishing environment for life in the deep sea to flourish while assuring a balanced aquatic ecosystem excluded from any external deep oceanic factors. It is estimated that there are more than 17,000 marine species in the Mediterranean Sea with generally higher marine biodiversity in coastal areas, continental shelves, and decreases with depth.\nAs a result of the drying of the sea during the Messinian salinity crisis, the marine biota of the Mediterranean are derived primarily from the Atlantic Ocean. The North Atlantic is considerably colder and more nutrient-rich than the Mediterranean, and the marine life of the Mediterranean has had to adapt to its differing conditions in the five million years since the basin was reflooded.\nThe Alboran Sea is a transition zone between the two seas, containing a mix of Mediterranean and Atlantic species. The Alboran Sea has the largest population of bottlenose dolphins in the Western Mediterranean, is home to the last population of harbour porpoises in the Mediterranean, and is the most important feeding grounds for loggerhead sea turtles in Europe. The Alboran Sea also hosts important commercial fisheries, including sardines and swordfish. The Mediterranean monk seals live in the Aegean Sea in Greece. In 2003, the World Wildlife Fund raised concerns about the widespread drift net fishing endangering populations of dolphins, turtles, and other marine animals such as the spiny squat lobster.\nThere was a resident population of orcas in the Mediterranean until the 1980s, when they went extinct, probably due to long-term PCB exposure. There are still annual sightings of orca vagrants.\n## Environmental issues\nFor 4,000 years, human activity has transformed most parts of Mediterranean Europe, and the \"humanisation of the landscape\" overlapped with the appearance of the present Mediterranean climate. The image of a simplistic, environmental determinist notion of a Mediterranean paradise on Earth in antiquity, which was destroyed by later civilisations, dates back to at least the 18th century and was for centuries fashionable in archaeological and historical circles. Based on a broad variety of methods, e.g. historical documents, analysis of trade relations, floodplain sediments, pollen, tree-ring and further archaeometric analyses and population studies, Alfred Thomas Grove's and Oliver Rackham's work on \"The Nature of Mediterranean Europe\" challenges this common wisdom of a Mediterranean Europe as a \"Lost Eden\", a formerly fertile and forested region, that had been progressively degraded and desertified by human mismanagement. The belief stems more from the failure of the recent landscape to measure up to the imaginary past of the classics as idealised by artists, poets and scientists of the early modern Enlightenment.\nThe historical evolution of climate, vegetation and landscape in southern Europe from prehistoric times to the present is much more complex and underwent various changes. For example, some of the deforestation had already taken place before the Roman age. While in the Roman age large enterprises such as the latifundia took effective care of forests and agriculture, the largest depopulation effects came with the end of the empire. Some assume that the major deforestation took place in modern times—the later usage patterns were also quite different e.g. in southern and northern Italy. Also, the climate has usually been unstable and there is evidence of various ancient and modern \"Little Ice Ages\", and plant cover accommodated to various extremes and became resilient to various patterns of human activity.\nHuman activity was therefore not the cause of climate change but followed it. The wide ecological diversity typical of Mediterranean Europe is predominantly based on human behaviour, as it is and has been closely related to human usage patterns. The diversity range was enhanced by the widespread exchange and interaction of the longstanding and highly diverse local agriculture, intense transport and trade relations, and the interaction with settlements, pasture and other land use. The greatest human-induced changes, however, came after World War II, in line with the \"1950s syndrome\" as rural populations throughout the region abandoned traditional subsistence economies. Grove and Rackham suggest that the locals left the traditional agricultural patterns and instead became scenery-setting agents for tourism. This resulted in more uniform, large-scale formations. Among further current important threats to Mediterranean landscapes are overdevelopment of coastal areas, abandonment of mountains and, as mentioned, the loss of variety via the reduction of traditional agricultural occupations.\n### Natural hazards\nThe region has a variety of geological hazards which have closely interacted with human activity and land use patterns. Among others, in the eastern Mediterranean, the Thera eruption, dated to the 17th or 16th century BC, caused a large tsunami that some experts hypothesise devastated the Minoan civilisation on the nearby island of Crete, further leading some to believe that this may have been the catastrophe that inspired the Atlantis legend. Mount Vesuvius is the only active volcano on the European mainland, while others, Mount Etna and Stromboli, are on neighbouring islands. The region around Vesuvius including the Phlegraean Fields Caldera west of Naples are quite active and constitute the most densely populated volcanic region in the world where an eruptive event may occur within decades.\nVesuvius itself is regarded as quite dangerous due to a tendency towards explosive (Plinian) eruptions. It is best known for its eruption in AD 79 that led to the burying and destruction of the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.\nThe large experience of member states and regional authorities has led to exchange on the international level with the cooperation of NGOs, states, regional and municipality authorities and private persons. The Greek–Turkish earthquake diplomacy is a quite positive example of natural hazards leading to improved relations between traditional rivals in the region after earthquakes in İzmir and Athens in 1999. The European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) was set up to respond to major natural disasters and express European solidarity to disaster-stricken regions within all of Europe. The largest amount of funding requests in the EU relates to forest fires, followed by floods and earthquakes. Forest fires, whether man-made or natural, are a frequent and dangerous hazard in the Mediterranean region. Tsunamis are also an often underestimated hazard in the region. For example, the 1908 Messina earthquake and tsunami took more than 123,000 lives in Sicily and Calabria and were among the most deadly natural disasters in modern Europe.\n### Invasive species\nThe opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 created the first salt-water passage between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The Red Sea is higher than the Eastern Mediterranean, so the canal functions as a tidal strait that pours Red Sea water into the Mediterranean. The Bitter Lakes, which are hyper-saline natural lakes that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonise the Eastern Mediterranean. The Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the Atlantic, so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the salty and nutrient-poor Eastern Mediterranean. Accordingly, Red Sea species invade the Mediterranean biota, and not vice versa; this phenomenon is known as the Lessepsian migration (after Ferdinand de Lesseps, the French engineer) or Erythrean (\"red\") invasion. The construction of the Aswan High Dam across the Nile River in the 1960s reduced the inflow of freshwater and nutrient-rich silt from the Nile into the Eastern Mediterranean, making conditions there even more like the Red Sea and worsening the impact of the invasive species.\nInvasive species have become a major component of the Mediterranean ecosystem and have serious impacts on the Mediterranean ecology, endangering many local and endemic Mediterranean species. A first look at some groups of exotic species shows that more than 70% of the non-indigenous decapods and about 63% of the exotic fishes occurring in the Mediterranean are of Indo-Pacific origin, introduced into the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal. This makes the Canal the first pathway of arrival of alien species into the Mediterranean. The impacts of some Lessepsian species have proven to be considerable, mainly in the Levantine basin of the Mediterranean, where they are replacing native species and becoming a familiar sight.\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature definition, as well as Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and Ramsar Convention terminologies, they are alien species, as they are non-native (non-indigenous) to the Mediterranean Sea, and they are outside their normal area of distribution which is the Indo-Pacific region. When these species succeed in establishing populations in the Mediterranean Sea, compete with and begin to replace native species they are \"Alien Invasive Species\", as they are an agent of change and a threat to the native biodiversity. In the context of CBD, \"introduction\" refers to the movement by human agency, indirect or direct, of an alien species outside of its natural range (past or present). The Suez Canal, being an artificial (man-made) canal, is a human agency. Lessepsian migrants are therefore \"introduced\" species (indirect, and unintentional). Whatever wording is chosen, they represent a threat to the native Mediterranean biodiversity, because they are non-indigenous to this sea. In recent years, the Egyptian government's announcement of its intentions to deepen and widen the canal have raised concerns from marine biologists, fearing that such an act will only worsen the invasion of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean, and lead to even more species passing through the canal.\n#### Arrival of new tropical Atlantic species\nIn recent decades, the arrival of exotic species from the tropical Atlantic has become noticeable. Whether this reflects an expansion of the natural area of these species that now enter the Mediterranean through the Gibraltar strait, because of a warming trend of the water caused by global warming; or an extension of the maritime traffic; or is simply the result of a more intense scientific investigation, is still an open question. While not as intense as the \"Lessepsian\" movement, the process may be of scientific interest and may, therefore, warrant increased levels of monitoring.\n### Sea-level rise\nBy 2100 the overall level of the Mediterranean could rise between 3 to 61 cm (1.2 to 24.0 in) as a result of the effects of climate change. This could have adverse effects on populations across the Mediterranean:\nRising sea levels will submerge parts of Malta. Rising sea levels will also mean rising salt water levels in Malta's groundwater supply and reduce the availability of drinking water. A 30 cm (12 in) rise in sea level would flood 200 square kilometres (77 sq mi) of the Nile Delta, displacing over 500,000 Egyptians. Cyprus wetlands are also in danger of being destroyed by the rising temperatures and sea levels.\nCoastal ecosystems also appear to be threatened by sea level rise, especially enclosed seas such as the Baltic, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. These seas have only small and primarily east–west movement corridors, which may restrict northward displacement of organisms in these areas. Sea level rise for the next century (2100) could be between 30 cm (12 in) and 100 cm (39 in) and temperature shifts of a mere 0.05–0.1 °C in the deep sea are sufficient to induce significant changes in species richness and functional diversity.\n### Pollution\nPollution in this region has been extremely high in recent years. The United Nations Environment Programme has estimated that 650,000,000 t (720,000,000 short tons) of sewage, 129,000 t (142,000 short tons) of mineral oil, 60,000 t (66,000 short tons) of mercury, 3,800 t (4,200 short tons) of lead and 36,000 t (40,000 short tons) of phosphates are dumped into the Mediterranean each year. The Barcelona Convention aims to 'reduce pollution in the Mediterranean Sea and protect and improve the marine environment in the area, thereby contributing to its sustainable development.' Many marine species have been almost wiped out because of the sea's pollution. One of them is the Mediterranean monk seal which is considered to be among the world's most endangered marine mammals. The Mediterranean is also plagued by marine debris. A 1994 study of the seabed using trawl nets around the coasts of Spain, France and Italy reported a particularly high mean concentration of debris; an average of 1,935 items per km2.\n#### Plastic pollution\nPlastic debris accounted for 76% of debris in a 1994 study, of which 94% was plastic bags.\n### Shipping\nSome of the world's busiest shipping routes are in the Mediterranean Sea. In particular, the Maritime Silk Road from Asia and Africa leads through the Suez Canal directly into the Mediterranean Sea to its deep-water ports in Piraeus, Trieste, Genoa, Marseilles and Barcelona. It is estimated that approximately 220,000 merchant vessels of more than 100 tonnes cross the Mediterranean Sea each year—about one-third of the world's total merchant shipping. These ships often carry hazardous cargo, which if lost would result in severe damage to the marine environment.\nThe discharge of chemical tank washings and oily wastes also represent a significant source of marine pollution. The Mediterranean Sea constitutes 0.7% of the global water surface and yet receives 17% of global marine oil pollution. It is estimated that every year between 100,000 t (98,000 long tons) and 150,000 t (150,000 long tons) of crude oil are deliberately released into the sea from shipping activities.\nApproximately 370,000,000 t (360,000,000 long tons) of oil are transported annually in the Mediterranean Sea (more than 20% of the world total), with around 250–300 oil tankers crossing the sea every day. An important destination is the Port of Trieste, the starting point of the Transalpine Pipeline, which covers 40% of Germany's oil demand (100% of the federal states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg), 90% of Austria and 50% of the Czech Republic. Accidental oil spills happen frequently with an average of 10 spills per year. A major oil spill could occur at any time in any part of the Mediterranean.\n### Tourism\nThe coast of the Mediterranean has been used for tourism since ancient times, as the Roman villa buildings on the Amalfi Coast or in Barcola show. From the end of the 19th century, in particular, the beaches became places of longing for many Europeans and travellers. From then on, and especially after World War II, mass tourism to the Mediterranean began with all its advantages and disadvantages. While initially, the journey was by train and later by bus or car, today the plane is increasingly used.\nTourism is today one of the most important sources of income for many Mediterranean countries, despite the man-made geopolitical conflicts in the region. The countries have tried to extinguish rising man-made chaotic zones that might affect the region's economies and societies in neighbouring coastal countries, and shipping routes. Naval and rescue components in the Mediterranean Sea are considered to be among the best due to the rapid cooperation between various naval fleets. Unlike the vast open oceans, the sea's closed position facilitates effective naval and rescue missions, considered the safest and regardless of any man-made or natural disaster.\nTourism is a source of income for small coastal communities, including islands, independent of urban centres. However, tourism has also played a major role in the degradation of the coastal and marine environment. Rapid development has been encouraged by Mediterranean governments to support the large numbers of tourists visiting the region, but this has caused serious disturbance to marine habitats by erosion and pollution in many places along the Mediterranean coasts.\nTourism often concentrates in areas of high natural wealth, causing a serious threat to the habitats of endangered species such as sea turtles and monk seals. Reductions in natural wealth may reduce the incentive for tourists to visit.\n### Overfishing\nFish stock levels in the Mediterranean Sea are alarmingly low. The European Environment Agency says that more than 65% of all fish stocks in the region are outside safe biological limits and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, that some of the most important fisheries—such as albacore and bluefin tuna, hake, marlin, swordfish, red mullet and sea bream—are threatened.\nThere are clear indications that catch size and quality have declined, often dramatically, and in many areas, larger and longer-lived species have disappeared entirely from commercial catches.\nLarge open-water fish like tuna have been a shared fisheries resource for thousands of years but the stocks are now dangerously low. In 1999, Greenpeace published a report revealing that the amount of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean had decreased by over 80% in the previous 20 years and government scientists warn that without immediate action the stock will collapse.\n### Marine heatwaves\nA study showed that climate change-related exceptional marine heatwaves in the Mediterranean Sea during 2015–2019 resulted in widespread mass sealife die-offs in five consecutive years.\n## Gallery\nCoast of Alexandria, view From Bibliotheca Alexandrina, Egypt Beach of Hammamet, Tunisia The beach of la Courtade in the Îles d'Hyères, France Sardinia's south coast, Italy Pretty Bay, Malta Panoramic view of Piran, Slovenia Panoramic view of Cavtat, Croatia View of Neum, Bosnia and Herzegovina A view of Sveti Stefan, Montenegro Ksamil Islands, Albania Navagio, Greece Ölüdeniz, Turquoise Coast, Turkey Paphos, Cyprus Burj Islam Beach, Latakia, Syria A view of Raouché off the coast of Beirut, Lebanon A view of Haifa, Israel Old city of Ibiza Town, Spain Les Aiguades near Béjaïa, Algeria El Jebha, a port town in Morocco Europa Point, Gibraltar Panoramic view of La Condamine, Monaco Sunset at the Deir al-Balah beach, Gaza Strip", "Mediterranean Sea\nIbiza\nMediterranean Sea, an intercontinental sea that stretches from the Atlantic Ocean on the west to Asia on the east and separates Europe from Africa.

{"name": "United States", "documents": ["Portsmouth, New HampshireUnited States, officially United States of America, abbreviated U.S. or U.S.A., byname America, country in North America, a federal republic of 50 states. Besides the 48 conterminous states that occupy the middle latitudes of the continent, the United States includes the state of Alaska, at the northwestern extreme of North America, and the island state of Hawaii, in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The conterminous states are bounded on the north by Canada, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The United States is the fourth largest country in the world in area (after Russia, Canada, and China). The national capital is Washington, which is coextensive with the District of Columbia, the federal capital region created in 1790. United StatesThe major characteristic of the United States is probably its great variety. Its physical environment ranges from the Arctic to the subtropical, from the moist rain forest to the arid desert, from the rugged mountain peak to the flat prairie. Although the total population of the United States is large by world standards, its overall population density is relatively low. The country embraces some of the world’s largest urban concentrations as well as some of the most extensive areas that are almost devoid of habitation.\nThe United States contains a highly diverse population. Unlike a country such as China that largely incorporated indigenous peoples, the United States has a diversity that to a great degree has come from an immense and sustained global immigration. Probably no other country has a wider range of racial, ethnic, and cultural types than does the United States. In addition to the presence of surviving Native Americans (including American Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos) and the descendants of Africans taken as enslaved persons to the New World, the national character has been enriched, tested, and constantly redefined by the tens of millions of immigrants who by and large have come to America hoping for greater social, political, and economic opportunities than they had in the places they left. (It should be noted that although the terms “America” and “Americans” are often used as synonyms for the United States and its citizens, respectively, they are also used in a broader sense for North, South, and Central America collectively and their citizens.)\nThe United States is the world’s greatest economic power, measured in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). The nation’s wealth is partly a reflection of its rich natural resources and its enormous agricultural output, but it owes more to the country’s highly developed industry. Despite its relative economic self-sufficiency in many areas, the United States is the most important single factor in world trade by virtue of the sheer size of its economy. Its exports and imports represent major proportions of the world total. The United States also impinges on the global economy as a source of and as a destination for investment capital. The country continues to sustain an economic life that is more diversified than any other on Earth, providing the majority of its people with one of the world’s highest standards of living.\nThe United States is relatively young by world standards, being less than 250 years old; it achieved its current size only in the mid-20th century. America was the first of the European colonies to separate successfully from its motherland, and it was the first nation to be established on the premise that sovereignty rests with its citizens and not with the government. In its first century and a half, the country was mainly preoccupied with its own territorial expansion and economic growth and with social debates that ultimately led to civil war and a healing period that is still not complete. In the 20th century the United States emerged as a world power, and since World War II it has been one of the preeminent powers. It has not accepted this mantle easily nor always carried it willingly; the principles and ideals of its founders have been tested by the pressures and exigencies of its dominant status. The United States still offers its residents opportunities for unparalleled personal advancement and wealth. However, the depletion of its resources, the contamination of its environment, and the continuing social and economic inequality that perpetuates areas of poverty and blight all threaten the fabric of the country.\nThe District of Columbia is discussed in the article Washington. For discussion of other major U.S. cities, see the articles Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Political units in association with the United States include Puerto Rico, discussed in the article Puerto Rico, and several Pacific islands, discussed in Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.\n## Land\nColorado River, Grand Canyon National ParkThe two great sets of elements that mold the physical environment of the United States are, first, the geologic, which determines the main patterns of landforms, drainage, and mineral resources and influences soils to a lesser degree, and, second, the atmospheric, which dictates not only climate and weather but also in large part the distribution of soils, plants, and animals. Although these elements are not entirely independent of one another, each produces on a map patterns that are so profoundly different that essentially they remain two separate geographies. (Since this article covers only the conterminous United States, see also the articles Alaska and Hawaii.)\n## Relief\nThe centre of the conterminous United States is a great sprawling interior lowland, reaching from the ancient shield of central Canada on the north to the Gulf of Mexico on the south. To east and west this lowland rises, first gradually and then abruptly, to mountain ranges that divide it from the sea on both sides. The two mountain systems differ drastically. The Appalachian Mountains on the east are low, almost unbroken, and in the main set well back from the Atlantic. From New York to the Mexican border stretches the low Coastal Plain, which faces the ocean along a swampy, convoluted coast. The gently sloping surface of the plain extends out beneath the sea, where it forms the continental shelf, which, although submerged beneath shallow ocean water, is geologically identical to the Coastal Plain. Southward the plain grows wider, swinging westward in Georgia and Alabama to truncate the Appalachians along their southern extremity and separate the interior lowland from the Gulf.\nWest of the Central Lowland is the mighty Cordillera, part of a global mountain system that rings the Pacific basin. The Cordillera encompasses fully one-third of the United States, with an internal variety commensurate with its size. At its eastern margin lie the Rocky Mountains, a high, diverse, and discontinuous chain that stretches all the way from New Mexico to the Canadian border. The Cordillera’s western edge is a Pacific coastal chain of rugged mountains and inland valleys, the whole rising spectacularly from the sea without benefit of a coastal plain. Pent between the Rockies and the Pacific chain is a vast intermontane complex of basins, plateaus, and isolated ranges so large and remarkable that they merit recognition as a region separate from the Cordillera itself.\nThese regions—the Interior Lowlands and their upland fringes, the Appalachian Mountain system, the Atlantic Plain, the Western Cordillera, and the Western Intermontane Region—are so various that they require further division into 24 major subregions, or provinces.\n## The Interior Lowlands and their upland fringes\nExplore the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, the Great Lakes, the Black Hills, and more in the American Midwest[See all videos for this article](/place/United-States/images-videos)Andrew Jackson is supposed to have remarked that the United States begins at the Alleghenies, implying that only west of the mountains, in the isolation and freedom of the great Interior Lowlands, could people finally escape Old World influences. Whether or not the lowlands constitute the country’s cultural core is debatable, but there can be no doubt that they comprise its geologic core and in many ways its geographic core as well.\nThis enormous region rests upon an ancient, much-eroded platform of complex crystalline rocks that have for the most part lain undisturbed by major orogenic (mountain-building) activity for more than 600,000,000 years. Over much of central Canada, these Precambrian rocks are exposed at the surface and form the continent’s single largest topographical region, the formidable and ice-scoured Canadian Shield.\nIn the United States most of the crystalline platform is concealed under a deep blanket of sedimentary rocks. In the far north, however, the naked Canadian Shield extends into the United States far enough to form two small but distinctive landform regions: the rugged and occasionally spectacular Adirondack Mountains of northern New York and the more-subdued and austere Superior Upland of northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. As in the rest of the shield, glaciers have stripped soils away, strewn the surface with boulders and other debris, and obliterated preglacial drainage systems. Most attempts at farming in these areas have been abandoned, but the combination of a comparative wilderness in a northern climate, clear lakes, and white-water streams has fostered the development of both regions as year-round outdoor recreation areas.\nMineral wealth in the Superior Upland is legendary. Iron lies near the surface and close to the deepwater ports of the upper Great Lakes. Iron is mined both north and south of Lake Superior, but best known are the colossal deposits of Minnesota’s Mesabi Range, for more than a century one of the world’s richest and a vital element in America’s rise to industrial power. In spite of depletion, the Minnesota and Michigan mines still yield a major proportion of the country’s iron and a significant percentage of the world’s supply.\nSouth of the Adirondack Mountains and the Superior Upland lies the boundary between crystalline and sedimentary rocks; abruptly, everything is different. The core of this sedimentary region—the heartland of the United States—is the great Central Lowland, which stretches for 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometres) from New York to central Texas and north another 1,000 miles to the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. To some, the landscape may seem dull, for heights of more than 2,000 feet (600 metres) are unusual, and truly rough terrain is almost lacking. Landscapes are varied, however, largely as the result of glaciation that directly or indirectly affected most of the subregion. North of the Missouri–Ohio river line, the advance and readvance of continental ice left an intricate mosaic of boulders, sand, gravel, silt, and clay and a complex pattern of lakes and drainage channels, some abandoned, some still in use. The southern part of the Central Lowland is quite different, covered mostly with loess (wind-deposited silt) that further subdued the already low relief surface. Elsewhere, especially near major rivers, postglacial streams carved the loess into rounded hills, and visitors have aptly compared their billowing shapes to the waves of the sea. Above all, the loess produces soil of extraordinary fertility. As the Mesabi iron was a major source of America’s industrial wealth, its agricultural prosperity has been rooted in Midwestern loess.\nThe Central Lowland resembles a vast saucer, rising gradually to higher lands on all sides. Southward and eastward, the land rises gradually to three major plateaus. Beyond the reach of glaciation to the south, the sedimentary rocks have been raised into two broad upwarps, separated from one another by the great valley of the Mississippi River. The Ozark Plateau lies west of the river and occupies most of southern Missouri and northern Arkansas; on the east the Interior Low Plateaus dominate central Kentucky and Tennessee. Except for two nearly circular patches of rich limestone country—the Nashville Basin of Tennessee and the Kentucky Bluegrass region—most of both plateau regions consists of sandstone uplands, intricately dissected by streams. Local relief runs to several hundreds of feet in most places, and visitors to the region must travel winding roads along narrow stream valleys. The soils there are poor, and mineral resources are scanty.\nEastward from the Central Lowland the Appalachian Plateau—a narrow band of dissected uplands that strongly resembles the Ozark Plateau and Interior Low Plateaus in steep slopes, wretched soils, and endemic poverty—forms a transition between the interior plains and the Appalachian Mountains. Usually, however, the Appalachian Plateau is considered a subregion of the Appalachian Mountains, partly on grounds of location, partly because of geologic structure. Unlike the other plateaus, where rocks are warped upward, the rocks there form an elongated basin, wherein bituminous coal has been preserved from erosion. This Appalachian coal, like the Mesabi iron that it complements in U.S. industry, is extraordinary. Extensive, thick, and close to the surface, it has stoked the furnaces of northeastern steel mills for decades and helps explain the huge concentration of heavy industry along the lower Great Lakes.\nHigh PlainsThe western flanks of the Interior Lowlands are the Great Plains, a territory of awesome bulk that spans the full distance between Canada and Mexico in a swath nearly 500 miles (800 km) wide. The Great Plains were built by successive layers of poorly cemented sand, silt, and gravel—debris laid down by parallel east-flowing streams from the Rocky Mountains. Seen from the east, the surface of the Great Plains rises inexorably from about 2,000 feet (600 metres) near Omaha, Nebraska, to more than 6,000 feet (1,825 metres) at Cheyenne, Wyoming, but the climb is so gradual that popular legend holds the Great Plains to be flat. True flatness is rare, although the High Plains of western Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and eastern Colorado come close. More commonly, the land is broadly rolling, and parts of the northern plains are sharply dissected into badlands.\nThe main mineral wealth of the Interior Lowlands derives from fossil fuels. Coal occurs in structural basins protected from erosion—high-quality bituminous in the Appalachian, Illinois, and western Kentucky basins; and subbituminous and lignite in the eastern and northwestern Great Plains. Petroleum and natural gas have been found in nearly every state between the Appalachians and the Rockies, but the Midcontinent Fields of western Texas and the Texas Panhandle, Oklahoma, and Kansas surpass all others. Aside from small deposits of lead and zinc, metallic minerals are of little importance.\n## Relief\nThe centre of the conterminous United States is a great sprawling interior lowland, reaching from the ancient shield of central Canada on the north to the Gulf of Mexico on the south.

It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, nine Minor Outlying Islands, and 326 Indian reservations. It is the third-largest country by both land and total area. The United States shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south. It has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations. With a population of over 331 million, it is the third most populous country in the world. The national capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city and financial center is New York City.\nPaleo-aboriginals migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago, and advanced cultures began to appear later on. These advanced cultures had almost completely declined by the time the Europeans had arrived in North America, who subsequently began to colonize the continent. The United States emerged from the Thirteen British Colonies when disputes with the British Crown over taxation and political representation led to the American Revolution (1765–1784), which established the nation's independence. In the late 18th century, the U.S. began expanding across North America, gradually obtaining new territories, sometimes through war, frequently displacing Native Americans, and admitting new states. By 1848, the United States spanned the continent from east to west. The controversy surrounding the practice of slavery culminated in the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861–1865). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment.\nBy 1900, the United States had become the world's largest economy, and the Spanish–American War and World War I established the country as a world power. After Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the Allied side. The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers. During the Cold War, both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance but avoided direct military conflict. They also competed in the Space Race, which culminated in the 1969 American spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Simultaneously, the civil rights movement led to legislation abolishing state and local Jim Crow laws and other codified racial discrimination against African Americans. The Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991 ended the Cold War, leaving the United States as the world's sole superpower. The September 11 attacks in 2001 resulted in the United States launching the war on terror which included the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) and the Iraq War (2003–2011).\nThe United States is a federal republic with three separate branches of government, including a bicameral legislature. It is a liberal democracy and market economy; it ranks high in international measures of human rights, quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, and education; and it has low levels of perceived corruption. It has high levels of incarceration and inequality, allows capital punishment, and lacks universal health care. As a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the U.S. has been shaped by centuries of immigration.\nThe United States is a highly developed country, and its economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP and is the world's largest by GDP at market exchange rates. By value, the United States is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter. Although it accounts for just over 4.2% of the world's total population, the U.S. holds over 30% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share held by any country. The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States, NATO, and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The country makes up more than a third of global military spending and is the foremost military power in the world and a leading political, cultural, and scientific force.\n## Etymology\nThe first known use of the name \"America\" dates to 1507, when it appeared on a world map produced by the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller in Saint Dié, Lorraine (now northeastern France). On his map, the name is shown in large letters on what would now be considered South America, honoring Amerigo Vespucci. The Italian explorer was the first to postulate that the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern limit but were part of a previously unknown landmass. In 1538, the Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator used the name \"America\" to refer to the entire Western Hemisphere.\nThe first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates from a January 2, 1776 letter written by Stephen Moylan to Joseph Reed, George Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his wish to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the revolutionary war effort. The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, on April 6, 1776.\nThe second draft of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, prepared by John Dickinson and completed no later than June 17, 1776, declared \"The name of this Confederation shall be the 'United States of America'.\" The final version of the Articles, sent to the states for ratification in late 1777, stated that \"The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'.\" In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his \"original Rough draught\" of the Declaration of Independence. This draft of the document did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation.\nThe phrase \"United States\" was originally plural in American usage. It described a collection of states—e.g., \"the United States are...\" The singular form became popular after the end of the Civil War and is now standard usage. A citizen of the United States is called an \"American\". \"United States\", \"American\", and \"U.S.\" refer to the country adjectivally (\"American values\", \"U.S. forces\"). In English, the word \"American\" rarely refers to topics or subjects not directly connected with the United States.\n## History\n### Indigenous peoples and pre-Columbian history\nIt is generally accepted that the first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 12,000 years ago; however, some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival. The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to represent the first wave of human settlement of the Americas. This was likely the first of three major waves of migration into North America; later waves brought the ancestors of present-day Athabaskans, Aleuts, and Eskimos.\nOver time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies. The city-state of Cahokia is the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States. In the Four Corners region, Ancestral Puebloan culture developed from centuries of agricultural experimentation. The Haudenosaunee, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries. Most prominent along the Atlantic coast were the Algonquian tribes, who practiced hunting and trapping, along with limited farming.\nEstimating the native population of North America during European contact is difficult. Douglas H. Ubelaker of the Smithsonian Institution estimated a population of 93 thousand in the South Atlantic states and a population of 473 thousand in the Gulf states, but most academics regard this figure as too low. Anthropologist Henry F. Dobyns believed the populations were much higher, suggesting around 1.1 million along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, 2.2 million people living between Florida and Massachusetts, 5.2 million in the Mississippi Valley and tributaries, and around 700,000 people in the Florida peninsula.\n### European settlements\nClaims of very early colonization of coastal New England by the Norse are disputed and controversial. The first documented arrival of Europeans in the continental United States is that of Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de León, who made his first expedition to Florida in 1513. The Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, sent by France to the New World in 1525, encountered native inhabitants of what is now New York Bay. Even earlier, Christopher Columbus had landed in Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage, and San Juan was settled by the Spanish a decade later. The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, such as Saint Augustine, often considered the nation's oldest city, and Santa Fe. The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico, notably New Orleans and Mobile.\nSuccessful English settlement of the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and with the Pilgrims' colony at Plymouth in 1620. The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses, was founded in 1619. Harvard College was established in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1636 as the first institution of higher education. The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies. Many English settlers were dissenting Christians who came seeking religious freedom. In 1784, the Russians were the first Europeans to establish a settlement in Alaska, at Three Saints Bay. The native population of America declined after European arrival for various reasons, primarily from diseases such as smallpox and measles.\nIn the early days of colonization, many European settlers experienced food shortages, disease, and conflicts with Native Americans, such as in King Philip's War. Native Americans were also often fighting neighboring tribes and European settlers. In many cases, however, the natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts; natives for guns, tools and other European goods. Natives taught many settlers to cultivate corn, beans, and other foodstuffs. European missionaries and others felt it was important to \"civilize\" the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural practices and lifestyles. However, with the increased European colonization of North America, Native Americans were displaced and often killed during conflicts.\nEuropean settlers also began trafficking African slaves into Colonial America via the transatlantic slave trade. Because of a lower prevalence of tropical diseases and relatively better treatment, slaves had a much higher life expectancy in North America than in South America, leading to a rapid increase in their numbers. Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and several colonies passed acts for or against the practice. However, by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves had supplanted European indentured servants as cash crop labor, especially in the American South.\nThe Thirteen Colonies that would become the United States of America were administered by the British as overseas dependencies. All nonetheless had local governments with elections open to most free men. With very high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations. The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest both in religion and in religious liberty.\nDuring the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), known in the U.S. as the French and Indian War, British forces captured Canada from the French. With the creation of the Province of Quebec, Canada's francophone population would remain isolated from the English-speaking colonial dependencies of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and the Thirteen Colonies. Excluding the Native Americans who lived there, the Thirteen Colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about a third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas. The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their unprecedented success motivated British monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.\n### Independence and early expansion\nThe American Revolution separated the Thirteen Colonies from the British Empire, and was the first successful war of independence by a non-European entity against a European power in modern history. By the 18th century the American Enlightenment and the political philosophies of liberalism were pervasive among leaders. Americans began to develop an ideology of \"republicanism\", asserting that government rested on the consent of the governed. They demanded their \"rights as Englishmen\" and \"no taxation without representation\". The British insisted on administering the colonies through a Parliament that did not have a single representative responsible for any American constituency, and the conflict escalated into war.\nIn 1774, the First Continental Congress passed the Continental Association, which mandated a colonies-wide boycott of British goods. The American Revolutionary War began the following year, catalyzed by events like the Stamp Act and the Boston Tea Party that were rooted in colonial disagreement with British governance. The Second Continental Congress, an assembly representing the United Colonies, unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776 (annually celebrated as Independence Day). In 1781, the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union established a decentralized government that operated until 1789. A celebrated early turn in the war for the Americans was George Washington leading the charge to cross the frozen Delaware River in a surprise attack the night of December 25–26, 1776. Another victory, in 1777, at the Battle of Saratoga resulted in the capture of a British army contingent, and led to France and Spain joining in the war against the British. After the surrender of a second British army at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty became internationally recognized, and the new nation took possession of substantial territory east of the Mississippi River, from what is today Canada in the north and Florida in the south.\nAs it became increasingly apparent that the Confederation was insufficient to govern the new country, nationalists advocated for and led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution to replace it, ratified in state conventions in 1788. Going into force in 1789, this constitution reorganized the government into a federation administered by three equal branches (executive, judicial and legislative), on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. George Washington, who had led the Continental Army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791. Tensions with Britain remained, however, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw.\nAlthough the federal government outlawed American participation in the Atlantic slave trade in 1807, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the use of slave labor. The Second Great Awakening, especially in the period 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism; in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.\nIn the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand further westward, some of them with a sense of manifest destiny. The 1803 Louisiana Purchase almost doubled the nation's area, Spain ceded Florida and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819, the Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845 during a period of expansionism, and the 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest. Additionally, the Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that forcibly resettled Indians. This further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets. This prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River from 1810 to at least 1890. and eventually, conflict with Mexico. Most of these conflicts ended with the cession of Native American territory and their confinement to Indian reservations. Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, and the U.S. spanned the continent. The California Gold Rush of 1848–1849 spurred migration to the Pacific coast, which led to the California Genocide and the creation of additional western states. Economic development was spurred by giving vast quantities of land, nearly 10% of the total area of the United States, to white European settlers as part of the Homestead Acts, as well as making land grants to private railroad companies and colleges. Prior to the Civil War, the prohibition or expansion of slavery into these territories exacerbated tensions over the debate around abolitionism.\n### Civil War and Reconstruction era\nIrreconcilable sectional conflict regarding the enslavement of Africans and African Americans ultimately led to the American Civil War. With the 1860 election of Republican Abraham Lincoln, conventions in eleven slave states declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America, while the federal government (the \"Union\") maintained that secession was unconstitutional and illegal. On April 12, 1861, the Confederacy initiated military conflict by bombarding Fort Sumter, a federal garrison in Charleston harbor, South Carolina. This would be the spark of the Civil War, which lasted for four years (1861–1865) and became the deadliest military conflict in American history. The war would result in the deaths of approximately 620,000 soldiers from both sides and upwards of 50,000 civilians, almost all of them in the South.\nReconstruction began in earnest following the war. While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, his assassination on April 14, 1865 drove a wedge between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans. They persisted until the Compromise of 1877, when the Republicans agreed to cease protecting the rights of African Americans in the South in order for Democrats to concede the presidential election of 1876. Southern white Democrats, calling themselves \"Redeemers\", took control of the South after the end of Reconstruction, beginning the nadir of American race relations. From 1890 to 1910, the Redeemers established so-called Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising most blacks and some impoverished whites throughout the region. Blacks would face racial segregation nationwide, especially in the South. They also occasionally experienced vigilante violence, including lynching.\n### Further immigration, expansion, and industrialization\nIn the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture. National infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West. After the American Civil War, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans. The later inventions of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life.\nMainland expansion also included the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867. In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the Spanish–American War. American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War. The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.\nRapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. The American economy boomed, becoming the world's largest. These dramatic changes were accompanied by growing inequality and social unrest, which prompted the rise of organized labor along with populist, socialist, and anarchist movements. This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms including health and safety regulation of consumer goods, the rise of labor unions, and greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.\n### World War I, Great Depression, and World War II\nThe United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I in 1914 until 1917 when it joined the war as an \"associated power\" alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However, the Senate refused to approve this and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations.\nAround this time, millions of rural African Americans began a mass migration from the South to northern urban centers; it would continue until about 1970. The last vestiges of the Progressive Era resulted in women's suffrage and alcohol prohibition. In 1920, the women's rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage. The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television. The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal. The Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.\nAt first neutral during World War II, the United States in March 1941 began supplying materiel to the Allies. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers, and in the following year, to intern about 120,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans. The U.S. pursued a \"Europe first\" defense policy, leaving the Philippines, an American colony, isolated and alone to fight Japan's invasion and occupation until the U.S.-led Philippines campaign (1944–1945). During the war, the United States was one of the \"Four Powers\" who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. The United States emerged relatively unscathed from the war, and with even greater economic and military influence.\nThe United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta conferences, which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe's postwar reorganization. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war. The United States and Japan then fought each other in the largest naval battle in history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945; the Japanese surrendered on September 2, ending World War II.\n### Cold War and late 20th century\nAfter World War II, the United States financed and implemented the Marshall Plan to help rebuild western Europe; disbursements paid between 1948 and 1952 would total $13 billion ($115 billion in 2021). Also at this time, geopolitical tensions between the United States and Russia led to the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored, sometimes pursuing direct action for regime change against left-wing governments. American troops fought the communist forces in the Korean War of 1950–1953, and the U.S. became increasingly involved in the Vietnam War (1955–1975), introducing combat forces in 1965. Their competition to achieve superior spaceflight capability led to the Space Race, which culminated in the U.S. becoming the first nation to land people on the Moon in 1969. While both countries engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear weapons, they avoided direct military conflict.\nAt home, the U.S. had experienced sustained economic expansion, urbanization, and a rapid growth of its population and middle class following World War II construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation's transportation infrastructure in decades to come. In 1959, the United States admitted Alaska and Hawaii to become the 49th and 50th states, formally expanding beyond the contiguous United States.\nThe growing civil rights movement used nonviolence to confront racism, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. President Lyndon B. Johnson initiated legislation that led to a series of policies addressing poverty and racial inequalities, in what he termed the \"Great Society\". The launch of a \"War on Poverty\" expanded entitlements and welfare spending, leading to the creation of the Food Stamp Program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, along with national health insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, made significant improvements. Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew, which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam War, the Black Power movement, and the sexual revolution. The women's movement in the U.S. broadened the debate on women's rights and made gender equality a major social goal. The 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City marked the beginning of the fledgling gay rights movement.\nThe United States supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War; in response, the country faced an oil embargo from OPEC nations, sparking the 1973 oil crisis. After a surge in female labor participation around the 1970s, by 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed. The 1970s and early 1980s also saw the onset of stagflation. After his election in 1980 President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free market-oriented reforms and initiated the more aggressive rollback strategy towards the Soviet Union. During Reagan's presidency, the federal debt held by the public nearly tripled in nominal terms, from $738 billion to $2.1 trillion. This led to the United States moving from the world's largest international creditor to the world's largest debtor nation. The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 ended the Cold War, ensuring a global unipolarity in which the U.S. was unchallenged as the world's dominant superpower.\nDue to the dot-com boom, stable monetary policy, and reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history. Fearing the spread of instability from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, in August 1991, President George H. W. Bush launched and led the Gulf War against Iraq, expelling Iraqi forces and restoring the Kuwaiti monarchy. Beginning in 1994, the U.S. signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), causing trade among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to soar.\n### 21st century\nOn September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorist hijackers flew passenger planes into the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people. In response, President George W. Bush launched the War on Terror, which included a nearly 20-year war in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021 and the 2003–2011 Iraq War. Government policy designed to promote affordable housing, widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance, and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve led to a housing bubble in 2006. This culminated in the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the Great Recession, the nation's largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.\nBarack Obama, the first multiracial president with African-American ancestry, was elected in 2008 amid the financial crisis. By the end of his second term, the stock market, median household income and net worth, and the number of persons with jobs were all at record levels, while the unemployment rate was well below the historical average. His signature legislative accomplishment was the Affordable Care Act (ACA), popularly known as \"Obamacare\". It represented the U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since Medicare in 1965. As a result, the uninsured share of the population was cut in half, while the number of newly insured Americans was estimated to be between 20 and 24 million. After Obama served two terms, Republican Donald Trump was elected as the 45th president in 2016. His election is viewed as one of the biggest political upsets in American history. Trump held office through the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting COVID-19 recession starting in 2020 that exceeded even the Great Recession earlier in the century.\nThe early 2020s saw the country become more divided, with various social issues sparking debate and protest. The murder of George Floyd in 2020 led to widespread civil unrest in urban centers and a national debate about police brutality and lingering institutional racism. The nationwide increase in the frequency of instances and number of deaths related to mass shootings added to the societal tensions. On January 6, 2021, supporters of the outgoing president, Trump, stormed the U.S. Capitol in an unsuccessful effort to disrupt the Electoral College vote count that would confirm Democrat Joe Biden as the 46th president. In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled that there is no constitutional right to an abortion, causing another wave of protests across the country and stoking international reactions as well. Despite these divisions, the country has remained unified against Russia after Vladimir Putin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with politicians and individuals across the political spectrum supporting arms shipments to Ukraine and many large American corporations pulling out of Russia and Belarus altogether.\n## Geography\nThe 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km2). Of this area, 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940 km2) is contiguous land, composing 83.65% of total U.S. land area. About 15% is occupied by Alaska, a state in northwestern North America, with the remainder in Hawaii, a state and archipelago in the central Pacific, and the five populated but unincorporated insular territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, and just ahead of Canada.\nThe United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and nearly equal to China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted, and how the total size of the United States is measured.\nThe coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont. The Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest. The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world's fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.\nThe Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado. Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave. The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges also reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California, and only about 84 miles (135 km) apart. At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and in North America. Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.\n### Climate\nThe United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.\nThe Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.\nStates bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South. Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country in the world.\nExtreme weather has become more frequent in the U.S., with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. Of the ten warmest years ever recorded in the 48 contiguous states, eight have occurred since 1998. In the American Southwest, droughts have become more persistent and more severe.\n### Biodiversity and conservation\nThe U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and more than 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland. The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, and 295 amphibians, and 91,000 insect species.\nThere are 63 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas, which are managed by the National Park Service. Altogether, the government owns about 28% of the country's land area, mostly in the western states. Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching, and about .86% is used for military purposes.\nEnvironmental issues include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation, and climate change. The most prominent environmental agency is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970. The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\nAs of 2020, the U.S. ranked 24th among nations in the Environmental Performance Index. The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016, and has many other environmental commitments. It withdrew from the Paris Agreement in 2020 but rejoined it in 2021.\n## Government and politics\nThe United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited island possessions. It is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a federal republic and a representative democracy \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law.\" In the American federal system, sovereignty is shared between two levels of government: federal and state. Citizens of the states are also governed by local governments, which are administrative divisions of the states. The territories are administrative divisions of the federal government.\nThe U.S. Constitution serves as the country's supreme legal document. The Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. The Constitution has been amended 27 times; the first ten amendments (Bill of Rights) and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review, and any law can be voided if the courts determine that it violates the Constitution. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803).\nThe United States has operated under a two-party system for most of its history. In American political culture, the center-right Republican Party is considered \"conservative\" and the center-left Democratic Party is considered \"liberal\". On Transparency International's 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index, its public sector position deteriorated from a score of 76 in 2015 to 69 in 2019. In 2021, the U.S. ranked 26th on the Democracy Index, and is described as a \"flawed democracy\".\n### Federal government\nThe federal government comprises three branches, which are headquartered in Washington, D.C. and regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the Constitution.\nLegislative: The bicameral Congress, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse, and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the federal government. Executive: The president is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies. Judicial: The Supreme Court and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the president with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.\nThe lower house, the House of Representatives, has 435 voting members, each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are apportioned among the states by population. Each state then draws single-member districts to conform with the census apportionment. The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories each have one member of Congress—these members are not allowed to vote.\nThe upper house, the Senate, has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at large to six-year terms; one-third of Senate seats are up for election every two years. The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories do not have senators. The Senate is unique among upper houses in being the most prestigious and powerful portion of the country's bicameral system; political scientists have frequently labeled it the \"most powerful upper house\" of any government.\nThe president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. The president is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia. The Supreme Court, led by the chief justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.\n### Political divisions\nEach of the 50 states holds jurisdiction over a geographic territory, where it shares sovereignty with the federal government. They are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington. Each state has the amount presidential electors equal to the number of their representatives plus senators in Congress, and the District of Columbia has three electors. Territories of the United States do not have presidential electors, therefore people there cannot vote for the president.\nCitizenship is granted at birth in all states, the District of Columbia, and all major U.S. territories except American Samoa. The United States observes limited tribal sovereignty of the American Indian nations, like states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states, tribes have some autonomy restrictions. They are prohibited from making war, engaging in their own foreign relations, and printing or issuing independent currency. Indian reservations are usually contained within one state, but there are 12 reservations that cross state boundaries.\n### Foreign relations\nThe United States has an established structure of foreign relations, and it had the world's second-largest diplomatic corps in 2019. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and home to the United Nations headquarters. The United States is also a member of the G7, G20, and OECD intergovernmental organizations. Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host formal diplomatic missions with United States, except Iran, North Korea, and Bhutan. Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close, if unofficial, relations. The United States also regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment.\nThe United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom and strong ties with Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Israel, and several European Union countries (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland). The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with nations in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United States–Mexico–Canada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States. The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau through the Compact of Free Association. Since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and began an invasion of Ukraine in 2022, significantly deteriorating relations with Russia in the process. The U.S. has also experienced a deterioration of relations with China and grown closer to Taiwan.\n### Military\nThe president is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Department of Defense, which is headquartered at the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., administers five of the six service branches, which are made up of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force. The Coast Guard is administered by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and can be transferred to the Department of the Navy in wartime. The United States spent $649 billion on its military in 2019, 36% of global military spending. At 4.7% of GDP, the percentage was the second-highest among all countries, after Saudi Arabia. It also has more than 40% of the world's nuclear weapons, the second-largest after Russia.\nIn 2019, all six branches of the U.S. Armed Forces reported 1.4 million personnel on active duty. The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors. Military service in the United States is voluntary, although conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System. The United States has the third-largest combined armed forces in the world, behind the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Indian Armed Forces.\nToday, American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy's 11 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with the Navy, and Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and 75th Ranger Regiment deployed by Air Force transport aircraft. The Air Force can strike targets across the globe through its fleet of strategic bombers, maintains the air defense across the United States, and provides close air support to Army and Marine Corps ground forces. The Space Force operates the Global Positioning System, operates the Eastern and Western Ranges for all space launches, and operates the United States's Space Surveillance and Missile Warning networks. The military operates about 800 bases and facilities abroad, and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.\n### Law enforcement and crime\nThere are about 18,000 U.S. police agencies from local to federal level in the United States. Law in the United States is mainly enforced by local police departments and sheriff's offices. The state police provides broader services, and federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, such as protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws. State courts conduct most civil and criminal trials, and federal courts handle designated crimes and appeals from the state criminal courts.\nAs of 2020, the United States has an intentional homicide rate of 7 per 100,000 people. A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States homicide rates \"were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher.\"\nThe United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and largest prison population in the world. In 2019, the total prison population for those sentenced to more than a year is 1,430,800, corresponding to a ratio of 419 per 100,000 residents and the lowest since 1995. Some estimates place that number higher, such Prison Policy Initiative's 2.3 million. Various states have attempted to reduce their prison populations via government policies and grassroots initiatives.\nAlthough most nations have abolished capital punishment, it is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and in 27 states out of 50 and in one territory. Several of these states have moratoriums on carrying out the penalty, each imposed by the state's governor. Since 1977, there have been more than 1,500 executions, giving the U.S. the sixth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt. However, the number is trended down nationally, with several states recently abolishing the penalty.\n## Economy\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) of $22.7 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 16% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity (PPP). From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7. The country ranks fifth in the world in nominal GDP per capita and seventh in GDP per capita at PPP. The country has been the world's largest economy since at least 1900.\nThe United States is the most technologically powerful and innovative nation, especially in artificial intelligence, computers, pharmaceuticals, and medical, aerospace, and military equipment. The nation's economy is fueled by abundant natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure, and high productivity. It has the second-highest total-estimated value of natural resources, valued at US$ 44.98 trillion in 2019, although sources differ on their estimates. Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD member states. In 2013, they had the sixth-highest median household income, down from fourth-highest in 2010.\nThe U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and is the world's foremost reserve currency, backed by its economy, its military, the petrodollar system and its linked eurodollar and large U.S. treasuries market. Several countries use it as their official currency and in others it is the de facto currency. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are the world's largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and trade volume.\nThe largest U.S. trading partners are China, the European Union, Canada, Mexico, India, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and Taiwan. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and the second-largest exporter. It has free trade agreements with several countries, including the USMCA. The U.S. ranked second in the Global Competitiveness Report in 2019, after Singapore. Of the world's 500 largest companies, 124 are headquartered in the U.S.\nWhile its economy has reached a post-industrial level of development, the United States remains an industrial power. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than most other high-income countries. The United States ranked the 41st highest in income inequality among 156 countries in 2017, and the highest compared to the rest of the developed world. On February 2, 2022, the United States had a national debt of $30 trillion.\n### Income and poverty\nAccounting for 4.24% of the global population, Americans collectively possess 30.2% of the world's total wealth as of 2021, the largest percentage of any country. The U.S. also ranks first in the number of dollar billionaires and millionaires in the world, with 724 billionaires (as of 2021) and nearly 22 million millionaires (2021). Wealth in the United States is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population own 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom 50% own just 2%. Income inequality in the U.S. remains at record highs, with the top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all income and giving the U.S. one of the widest income distributions among OECD members.\nThe United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation and is one of a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right. The United States also has a higher percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation, largely because of a weak collective bargaining system and lack of government support for at-risk workers.\nThere were about 567,715 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in January 2019, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program. Attempts to combat homelessness include the Section 8 housing voucher program and implementation of the Housing First strategy across all levels of government. In 2011, 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 845,000 U.S. children (1.1%) saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic. As of June 2018, 40 million people, roughly 12.7% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty, including 13.3 million children. Of those impoverished, 18.5 million live in \"deep poverty\", family income below one-half of the federal government's poverty threshold.\n### Science, technology, and energy\nThe United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts and the establishment of a machine tool industry enabled the U.S. to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles, and other items in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, factory electrification, the introduction of the assembly line, and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production. In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and development funding comes from the private sector. In 2020, the United States was the country with the second-highest number of published scientific papers and second most patents granted, both after China. In 2021, the United States launched a total of 51 spaceflights. (China reported 55.) The U.S. had 2,944 active satellites in space in December 2021, the highest number of any country.\nIn 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison's research laboratory developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera. The Wright brothers in 1903 made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight, and the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line in the early 20th century. The rise of fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 30s led many European scientists, such as Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States. During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age. During the Cold War, competition for superior missile capability ushered in the Space Race between the U.S. and Soviet Union. The invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key component in almost all modern electronics, led to the development of microprocessors, software, personal computers and the Internet. In 2022, the United States ranked 2nd in the Global Innovation Index.\nAs of 2019, the United States receives approximately 80% of its energy from fossil fuels. In 2019, the largest source of the country's energy came from petroleum (36.6%), followed by natural gas (32%), coal (11.4%), renewable sources (11.4%) and nuclear power (8.4%). Americans constitute less than 5% of the world's population, but consume 17% of the world's energy. They account for about 25% of the world's petroleum consumption, while producing only 6% of the world's annual petroleum supply. The U.S. ranks as second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases, exceeded only by China.\n### Transportation\nThe United States's rail network, nearly all standard gauge, is the longest in the world, and exceeds 293,564 km (182,400 mi). It handles mostly freight, with intercity passenger service provided by Amtrak to all but four states. The country's inland waterways are the world's fifth-longest, and total 41,009 km (25,482 mi).\nPersonal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads. The United States has the world's second-largest automobile market, and has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, with 816.4 vehicles per 1,000 Americans (2014). In 2017, there were 255 million non-two wheel motor vehicles, or about 910 vehicles per 1,000 people.\nThe civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned. The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways. Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Of the fifty busiest container ports, four are located in the United States, of which the busiest is the Port of Los Angeles.\n## Demographics\n### Population\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents as of April 1, 2020, making the United States the third most populous nation in the world, after China and India. According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock, on January 28, 2021, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 100 seconds, or about 864 people per day. In 2018, 52% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 32% had never been married. In 2020, the U.S. had a total fertility rate stood at 1.64 children per woman and the world's highest rate (23%) of children living in single-parent households.\nThe United States of America has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members. White Americans of European ancestry form the largest racial and ethnic group at 57.8% of the United States population. Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and are 18.7% of the United States population. African Americans constitute the nation's third-largest ancestry group and are 12.1% of the total United States population. Asian Americans are the country's fourth-largest group, composing 5.9% of the United States population, while the country's 3.7 million Native Americans account for about 1%. In 2020, the median age of the United States population was 38.5 years.\nIn 2018, there were almost 90 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for 28% of the overall U.S. population. In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants. The United States led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.\n### Language\nEnglish (specifically, American English) is the de facto national language of the United States. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English, and most states have declared English as the official language. Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English, including Hawaii (Hawaiian), Alaska (twenty Native languages), South Dakota (Sioux), American Samoa (Samoan), Puerto Rico (Spanish), Guam (Chamorro), and the Northern Mariana Islands (Carolinian and Chamorro). In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English.\nAccording to the American Community Survey, in 2010 some 229 million people (out of the total U.S. population of 308 million) spoke only English at home. More than 37 million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language in the United States. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (2.8 million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), Korean (1.1 million), and German (1 million).\nThe most widely taught foreign languages in the United States, in terms of enrollment numbers from kindergarten through university undergraduate education, are Spanish (around 7.2 million students), French (1.5 million), and German (500,000). Other commonly taught languages include Latin, Japanese, American Sign Language, Italian, and Chinese.\n### Religion\nThe First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment. The Latter-day Saints (commonly known as Mormons) and the Jehovah's Witnesses are the two largest religions founded in the United States, while European colonists imported more typical religions such as Catholicism and Protestantism from Europe.\nPew Research Center studies during the late 2010s and early 2020s found that about 90% of Americans believe in God, 65% of Americans report that religion plays an important or very important role in their lives, 61% report praying weekly or more, and 43% report attending religious services at least monthly, proportions which are unique among developed countries. The United States has the world's largest Christian population. Protestantism is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United States, accounting for almost half of all Americans. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism at 15.4%, and the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest individual Protestant denomination at 5.3% of the U.S. population. The remaining Protestants are either in other denominations, nondenominational, or not specified in the survey. In the so-called Bible Belt, located primarily within the Southern United States, socially conservative evangelical Protestantism plays a significant role culturally. By contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and the Western United States.\nIn a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults in the United States identified themselves as Christians, and 5.9% claimed a non-Christian religion. These include Judaism (1.9%), Islam (1.1%), Hinduism (0.7%), and Buddhism (0.7%). The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion. Membership in a house of worship fell from 70% in 1999 to 47% in 2020, much of the decline related to the number of Americans expressing no religious preference. However, membership also fell among those who identified with a specific religious group.\n### Urbanization\nAbout 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs; about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000. In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston) had populations exceeding two million. Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.\n### Health\nIn a preliminary report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that U.S. life expectancy at birth had dropped to 76.1 years in 2021 (73.2 years for men and 79.1 years for women), down 0.9 years from 2020. This was the second year of overall decline, and the chief causes listed were the COVID-19 pandemic, accidents, drug overdoses, heart and liver disease, and suicides. Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among Blacks and American Indian–Alaskan Native (AIAN) peoples. Starting in 1998, the average life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since. The U.S. also has one of the highest suicide rates among high-income countries, and approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight.\nIn 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic collisions caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most harmful risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol consumption. Alzheimer's disease, substance use disorders, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates. Teenage pregnancy and abortion rates in the U.S. are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics.\nThe U.S. health care system far outspends that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer nations. The U.S., however, is a global leader in medical innovation. The United States is the only developed nation without a system of universal health care, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance.\nGovernment-funded health care coverage for the poor (Medicaid, established in 1965) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare, begun in 1966) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA, which the CDC said that the law roughly halved the uninsured share of the population and multiple studies have concluded that ACA had reduced the mortality of enrollees. However, its legacy remains controversial.\n### Education\nAmerican public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or six (beginning with kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17. Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees. The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%.\nThe United States has many private and public institutions of higher education. The majority of the world's top public and private universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States. There are also local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world, spending an average of $12,794 per year on public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016–2017 school year. As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending. Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place, student loan debt has increased by 102% in the last decade, and exceeded 1.7 trillion dollars as of 2022.\n## Culture and society\nThe United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values, and exerts major cultural influence on a global scale. Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors immigrated or were imported as slaves within the past five centuries. Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa. More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture. Nevertheless, there is a high degree of social inequality related to race and wealth.\nAmericans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism, as well as a unifying belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, social equality, property rights, democracy, equality under the law, and a preference for limited government. Americans are extremely charitable by global standards: according to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity, the highest in the world by a large margin.\nThe American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants. Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate. While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society, scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values. Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition.\n### Literature and visual arts\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of their cues from Europe, contributing to Western culture. Writers such as Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is recognized as an essential American poet. A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925) and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)—may be dubbed the \"Great American Novel.\" Thirteen U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.\nIn the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene. Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Edward Weston, and Ansel Adams.\n### Cinema and theater\nHollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production. The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using the Kinetoscope. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization. The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929, and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.\nDirector D. W. Griffith, an American filmmaker during the silent film period, was central to the development of film grammar, and producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising. Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s, with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures. In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\" was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.\nTheater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater. The central hub of the American theater scene has been Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, Off-Broadway, and Off-Off-Broadway. Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons, with some works being produced regionally with hopes of eventually moving to New York. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater also has an active community theater culture, which relies mainly on local volunteers who may not be actively pursuing a theatrical career.\n### Music\nAmerican folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, Mainland Europe, or Africa.\nAmong America's earliest composers was a man named William Billings who, born in Boston, composed patriotic hymns in the 1770s; Billings was a part of the First New England School, who dominated American music during its earliest stages. Anthony Heinrich was the most prominent composer before the Civil War. From the mid- to late 1800s, John Philip Sousa of the late Romantic era composed numerous military songs—particularly marches—and is regarded as one of America's greatest composers.\nThe rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have significantly influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. In recent years, hip hop has become popular, with artists of the 1990s such as Tupac Shakur, Nas, and Eminem as pioneers, and artists such as Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, Lil Wayne, and Nicki Minaj continuing its popularity into the 2010s and 2020s.\nElvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the pioneers of rock and roll in the mid-1950s. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters. Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley became global celebrities, as have artists of the late 20th century such as Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey.\n### Mass media\nThe four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches. As of 2021, about 83% of Americans over age 12 listen to broadcast radio, while about 41% listen to podcasts. As of September 30, 2014, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.\nWell-known U.S. newspapers include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and USA Today. More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as New York City's The Village Voice or Los Angeles' LA Weekly. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Amazon, Yahoo, and Facebook.\n### Food\nEarly settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. They and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour, beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine. Homegrown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when many Americans make or purchase traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.\nThe American fast food industry, the world's largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s. Characteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.\nAmericans drink three times as much coffee as tea. Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk standard breakfast beverages.\n### Sports\nThe most popular sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball and ice hockey.\nWhile most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide. Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact. The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.\nAmerican football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States; the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally. Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball being the top league. Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two most popular professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.\nEight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe. The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. As of 2021, the United States has won 2,629 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 330 in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most behind Norway. In soccer, the men's national soccer team qualified for eleven World Cups and the women's team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup four times. The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup along with Canada and Mexico.

The monument was established in 1906 and has an area of 2 square miles (5 square km).\nEl Morro (the “Headlands,” or “Bluff”), or Inscription Rock, is a soft sandstone mesa (cuesta) rising 200 feet (60 metres) above the valley floor. A water catchment basin and sheltered coves at its foot made it an important camping place on the trail to the fabled cities of Cíbola. Indians, Spaniards, and Americans left hundreds of inscriptions (1605–1906) on the cliff sides of the mesa. The best-known of these inscriptions was left by the Spanish conquistador Juan de Oñate when he passed through the region in 1605. El Morro also has a number of pre-Columbian petroglyphs, and on its top lie ruins of two Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi) pueblos.", "# El Morro National Monument\nEl Morro National Monument is a U.S. national monument in Cibola County, New Mexico, United States. Located on an ancient east–west trail in the western part of the state, the monument preserves the remains of a large prehistoric pueblo atop a great sandstone promontory with a pool of water at its base, which subsequently became a landmark where over the centuries explorers and travelers have left personal inscriptions that survive today.\nBetween about 1275 to 1350 AD, up to 600 people of the Ancestral Puebloan culture lived in the 355+-room mesa-top pueblo. The village was situated on the old Zuni-Acoma Trail, an important ancient trade route. Spanish explorers visiting the area in the 16th century referred to the notable promontory as El Morro (\"The Headland\"); the local Zuni Indians call it A'ts'ina (\"Place of writings on the rock\"), and early Anglo-Americans referred to it as Inscription Rock.\nWith its oasis-like source of water, El Morro served as a natural resting place for numerous travelers through the otherwise arid and desolate region, many of whom left their signatures, names, dates, and stories of their treks in the walls of the sandstone cliff. While some of the inscriptions are now faded through age, there are still many that can be seen today and remain legible, with some dating back to the 17th century. The oldest legible inscription at El Morro, left by Juan de Oñate, the first Spanish governor of the colony of Santa Fe de Nuevo México, is dated April 16, 1605. Among the Anglo-American emigrants who left their names there in 1858 were several members of the Rose-Baley Party, including Leonard Rose and John Udell. Nearby petroglyphs and carvings made by the Ancestral Puebloans were inscribed centuries before Europeans arrived. In 1906, U.S. federal law prohibited further carving on the cliffs.\nEl Morro was designated a national monument by President Theodore Roosevelt on December 8, 1906, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. Today the site is managed by the National Park Service. The many inscription panels, water pool, pueblo ruins, and the top of the promontory are all accessible via park trails. El Morro is one of many prehistoric sites on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, a designated New Mexico Scenic Byway. The monument was featured in the film Four Faces West (1948), starring Joel McCrea. In December 2019, the International Dark Sky Association certified El Morro as an International Dark Sky Park, recognizing its preservation of not only the historic inscriptions but also its natural night sky.\n## Gallery\nInscription by Juan de Oñate in 1605.

{"name": "Afghanistan", "documents": ["Mazār-e Sharīf, Afghanistan: Blue Mosque\nAfghanistan, multiethnic landlocked country located in the heart of south-central Asia. Lying along important trade routes connecting southern and eastern Asia to Europe and the Middle East, Afghanistan has long been a prize sought by empire builders, and for millennia great armies have attempted to subdue it, leaving traces of their efforts in great monuments now fallen to ruin. The country’s forbidding landscape of deserts and mountains has laid many imperial ambitions to rest, as has the tireless resistance of its fiercely independent peoples—so independent that the country has failed to coalesce into a nation but has instead long endured as a patchwork of contending ethnic factions and ever-shifting alliances.\nAfghanistan\nThe modern boundaries of Afghanistan were established in the late 19th century in the context of a rivalry between imperial Britain and tsarist Russia that Rudyard Kipling termed the “Great Game.” Modern Afghanistan became a pawn in struggles over political ideology and commercial influence. In the last quarter of the 20th century, Afghanistan suffered the ruinous effects of civil war greatly exacerbated by a military invasion and occupation by the Soviet Union (1979–89). In subsequent armed struggles, a surviving Afghan communist regime held out against Islamic insurgents (1989–92), and, following a brief rule by mujahideen groups, an austere movement of religious students—the Taliban—rose up against the country’s governing parties and warlords and established a theocratic regime (1996–2001) that soon fell under the influence of a group of well-funded Islamists led by an exiled Saudi Arabian, Osama bin Laden. The Taliban regime collapsed in December 2001 in the wake of a sustained U.S.-dominated military campaign aimed at the Taliban and fighters of bin Laden’s al-Qaeda organization. Soon thereafter, anti-Taliban forces agreed to a period of transitional leadership and an administration that would lead to a new constitution and the establishment of a democratically elected government.\nThe capital of Afghanistan is its largest city, Kabul. A serene city of mosques and gardens during the storied reign of the emperor Bābur (1526–30), founder of the Mughal dynasty, and for centuries an important entrepôt on the Silk Road, Kabul lay in ruins following the long and violent Afghan War. So, too, fared much of the country, its economy in shambles and its people scattered and despondent. By the early 21st century an entire generation of Afghans had come to adulthood knowing nothing but war.\n## Land\nAfghanistan is completely landlocked—the nearest coast lies along the Arabian Sea, about 300 miles (480 km) to the south—and, because of both its isolation and its volatile political history, it remains one of the most poorly surveyed areas of the world. It is bounded to the east and south by Pakistan (including those areas of Kashmir administered by Pakistan but claimed by India), to the west by Iran, and to the north by the Central Asian states of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. It also has a short border with Xinjiang, China, at the end of the long, narrow Vākhān (Wakhan Corridor), in the extreme northeast. Its overall area is roughly twice that of Norway.\n## Relief\n## The Hindu Kush\nAfghanistan’s shape has been compared to a leaf, of which the Vākhān strip, nestled high in the Pamirs, forms the stem. The outstanding geographic feature of Afghanistan is its mountain range, the Hindu Kush. This formidable range creates the major pitch of Afghanistan from northeast to southwest and, along with its subsidiary ranges, divides Afghanistan into three distinct geographic regions, which roughly can be designated as the central highlands, the northern plains, and the southwestern plateau. When the Hindu Kush itself reaches a point some 100 miles (160 km) north of Kabul, it spreads out and continues westward as a series of ranges under the names of Bābā, Bāyan, Sefīd Kūh (Paropamisus), and others, and each section in turn sends spurs in different directions. One of these spurs is the Torkestān Mountains, which extend northwestward. Other important ranges include the Sīāh Kūh, south of the Harīrūd, and the Ḥeṣār Mountains, which stretch northward. A number of other ranges, including the Mālmand and Khākbād, extend to the southwest. On the eastern frontier with Pakistan, several mountain ranges effectively isolate the interior of the country from the moisture-laden winds that blow from the Indian Ocean. This accounts for the dryness of the climate.\n## Physiographic regions\nThe central highlands—actually a part of the Himalayan chain—include the main Hindu Kush range. Its area of about 160,000 square miles (414,000 square km) is a region of deep, narrow valleys and lofty mountains, some peaks of which rise above 21,000 feet (6,400 metres). High mountain passes, generally situated between 12,000 and 15,000 feet (3,600 to 4,600 metres) above sea level, are of great strategic importance and include the Shebar Pass, located northwest of Kabul where the Bābā Mountains branch out from the Hindu Kush, and the storied Khyber Pass, which leads to the Indian subcontinent, on the Pakistan border southeast of Kabul. The Badakhshān area in the northeastern part of the central highlands is the location of the epicentres for many of the 50 or so earthquakes that occur in the country each year.\nThe northern plains region, north of the central highlands, extends eastward from the Iranian border to the foothills of the Pamirs, near the border with Tajikistan. It comprises some 40,000 square miles (103,000 square km) of plains and fertile foothills sloping gently toward the Amu Darya (the ancient Oxus River). This area is a part of the much larger Central Asian Steppe, from which it is separated by the Amu Darya. The average elevation is about 2,000 feet (600 metres). The northern plains region is intensively cultivated and densely populated. In addition to fertile soils, the region possesses rich mineral resources, particularly deposits of natural gas.\nThe southwestern plateau, south of the central highlands, is a region of high plateaus, sandy deserts, and semideserts. The average elevation is about 3,000 feet (900 metres). The southwestern plateau covers about 50,000 square miles (130,000 square km), one-fourth of which forms the sandy Rīgestān region. The smaller Mārgow Desert of salt flats and desolate steppe lies west of Rīgestān. Several large rivers cross the southwestern plateau; among them are the Helmand River and its major tributary, the Arghandāb.\nMost of Afghanistan lies between 2,000 and 10,000 feet (600 and 3,000 metres) in elevation. Along the Amu Darya in the north and the delta of the Helmand River in the southwest, the elevation is about 2,000 feet (600 metres). The Sīstān depression of the southwestern plateau is roughly 1,500 to 1,700 feet (450 to 500 metres) in elevation.\n## Relief\n## The Hindu Kush\nAfghanistan’s shape has been compared to a leaf, of which the Vākhān strip, nestled high in the Pamirs, forms the stem.

Referred to as the Heart of Asia, it is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south, Iran to the west, Turkmenistan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north, Tajikistan to the northeast, and China to the northeast and east. Occupying 652,864 square kilometers (252,072 sq mi) of land, the country is predominantly mountainous with plains in the north and the southwest, which are separated by the Hindu Kush mountain range. As of 2021, its population is 40.2 million (officially estimated to be 32.9 million), composed mostly of ethnic Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks. Kabul is the country's largest city and serves as its capital.\nHuman habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic era, and the country's strategic location along the historic Silk Road has led it to being described, picturesquely, as the ‘roundabout of the ancient world’. Popularly referred to as the graveyard of empires, the land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns, including those by the Persians, Alexander the Great, the Maurya Empire, Arab Muslims, the Mongols, the British, the Soviet Union, and most recently by an American-led coalition. Afghanistan also served as the source from which the Greco-Bactrians and the Mughals, among others, rose to form major empires. The various conquests and periods in both the Iranian and Indian cultural spheres made the area a center for Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and later Islam throughout history.\nThe modern state of Afghanistan began with the Durrani dynasty in the 18th century, with the Durrani Afghan Empire being formed by Ahmad Shah Durrani. The Durrani Empire led conquests in which, at its peak, encompassed land that spanned from eastern Iran to northern India. Following its decline and the death of Ahmad Shah Durrani, and Timur Shah, it was divided into multiple smaller independent kingdoms, including but not limited to: Herat, Kandahar and Kabul. Afghanistan would be reunited in the 19th century after wars of unification led by Dost Mohammad Khan, where he conquered the independent principalities in Afghanistan. Dost Mohammad died in 1863, weeks after his last campaign to unite Afghanistan, and as a result, threw Afghanistan back into civil war with his successors. During this time, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between the British Empire (in British-ruled India) and the Russian Empire. From India, the British attempted to subjugate Afghanistan but were repelled in the First Anglo-Afghan War. However, the Second Anglo-Afghan War saw a British victory and the successful establishment of British political influence over Afghanistan. Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919, Afghanistan became free of foreign dominance, and eventually emerged as the independent Kingdom of Afghanistan in June 1926 under Amanullah Khan. This monarchy lasted almost 50 years, until Zahir Shah was overthrown in 1973, following which the Republic of Afghanistan was established.\nSince the late 1970s, Afghanistan's history has been dominated by extensive warfare, including coups, invasions, insurgencies, and civil wars which would end twice with the victory of the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban. In 1979 the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Mujahideen fought against them in the Soviet–Afghan War and continued fighting amongst themselves following Soviet withdrawal in 1989. The Taliban controlled most of the country by 1996, but their Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan received little international recognition before its overthrow in the 2001 United States invasion of Afghanistan. The Taliban returned to power in 2021 following Kabul's capture by the Taliban and the concurrent overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, ending the 2001–2021 war. Although initially claiming to form an inclusive government for the country, the Taliban in September 2021 re-established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan with an interim government made up entirely of Taliban members; the regime currently remains internationally unrecognized.\nAfghanistan is prominently rich in natural resources, including lithium, iron, zinc, and copper, amongst many others. It is also the world's largest producer of opium, second largest producer of cannabis, and third largest of both saffron and cashmere. The country is a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and a founding member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Due to the effects of war in recent decades, the country has dealt with high levels of terrorism, poverty, and child malnutrition. Afghanistan's economy is the world's 96th-largest, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $72.9 billion by purchasing power parity; the country fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP), ranking 169th out of 186 countries as of 2018.\n## Etymology\nSome scholars suggest that the root name \"Afghān\" is derived from the Sanskrit word Aśvakan or Assakan, which was the name used for ancient inhabitants of the Hindu Kush. Aśvakan literally means \"horsemen\", \"horse breeders\", or \"cavalrymen\" (from aśva or aspa, the Sanskrit and Avestan words for \"horse\"). However, others such as Ibrahim Khan have contended that the word Afghan comes from Bactrian.\nHistorically, the ethnonym Afghān was used to refer to ethnic Pashtuns. The Arabic and Persian form of the name, Afġān, was first attested in the 10th-century geography book Hudud al-'Alam. The last part of the name, \"-stan\", is a Persian suffix meaning \"place of\". Therefore, \"Afghanistan\" translates to \"land of the Afghans\", or \"land of the Pashtuns\" in a historical sense. According to the third edition of the Encyclopedia of Islam:\nThe name Afghanistan (Afghānistān, land of the Afghans/Pashtuns, afāghina, sing. afghān) can be traced to the early eighth/fourteenth century, when it designated the easternmost part of the Kartid realm. This name was later used for certain regions in the Ṣafavid and Mughal empires that were inhabited by Afghans. While based on a state-supporting elite of Abdālī/Durrānī Afghans, the Sadūzāʾī Durrānī polity that came into being in 1160/1747 was not called Afghanistan in its own day. The name became a state designation only during the colonial intervention of the nineteenth century.\n## Ancient history\nMany empires and kingdoms have also risen to power in Afghanistan, such as the Greco-Bactrians, Indo-Scythians, Kushans, Kidarites, Hephthalites, Alkhons, Nezaks, Zunbils, Turk Shahis, Hindu Shahis, Lawiks, Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Khaljis, Kartids, Lodis, Surs, Mughals, and finally, the Hotak and Durrani dynasties, which marked the political origins of the modern state. Throughout millennia several cities within the modern day Afghanistan served as capitals of various empires, namely, Bactra (Balkh), Alexandria on the Oxus (Ai-Khanoum), Kapisi, Sigal, Kabul, Kunduz, Zaranj, Firozkoh, Herat, Ghazna (Ghazni), Binban (Bamyan), and Kandahar.\nThe country has been home to various peoples through the ages, among them the ancient Iranian peoples who established the dominant role of Indo-Iranian languages in the region. At multiple points, the land has been incorporated within vast regional empires; among them the Achaemenid Empire, the Macedonian Empire, the Maurya Empire, and the Islamic Empire. For its success in resisting foreign occupation during the 19th and 20th centuries, Afghanistan has been called the \"graveyard of empires\", though it is unknown who coined the phrase.\n### Prehistory and antiquity\nExcavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world. An important site of early historical activities, many believe that Afghanistan compares to Egypt in terms of the historical value of its archaeological sites.\n#### Ancient era\nArchaeological exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east, west, and north. Artifacts typical of the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron Ages have been found in Afghanistan. Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of Mundigak (near Kandahar in the south of the country) was a center of the Helmand culture. More recent findings established that the Indus Valley Civilisation stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan, making the ancient civilization today part of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India. In more detail, it extended from what today is northwest Pakistan to northwest India and northeast Afghanistan. An Indus Valley site has been found on the Oxus River at Shortugai in northern Afghanistan. There are several smaller IVC colonies to be found in Afghanistan as well. An Indus Valley site has been found on the Oxus River at Shortugai in northern Afghanistan, shows Afghanistan to have been a part of Indus Valley civilisation.\nAfter 2000 BCE, successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan; among them were many Indo-European-speaking Indo-Iranians. These tribes later migrated further into South Asia, Western Asia, and toward Europe via the area north of the Caspian Sea. The region at the time was referred to as Ariana.\nBy the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the Medes and incorporated Arachosia, Aria, and Bactria within its eastern boundaries. An inscription on the tombstone of Darius I of Persia mentions the Kabul Valley in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered. The region of Arachosia, around Kandahar in modern-day southern Afghanistan, used to be primarily Zoroastrian and played a key role in the transfer of the Avesta to Persia and is thus considered by some to be the \"second homeland of Zoroastrianism\".\nAlexander the Great and his Macedonian forces arrived in Afghanistan in 330 BCE after defeating Darius III of Persia a year earlier in the Battle of Gaugamela. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the Seleucid Empire controlled the region until 305 BCE when they gave much of it to the Maurya Empire as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans controlled the area south of the Hindu Kush until they were overthrown in about 185 BCE. Their decline began 60 years after Ashoka's rule ended, leading to the Hellenistic reconquest by the Greco-Bactrians. Much of it soon broke away from them and became part of the Indo-Greek Kingdom. They were defeated and expelled by the Indo-Scythians in the late 2nd century BCE.\nThe Silk Road appeared during the first century BCE, and Afghanistan flourished with trade, with routes to China, India, Persia and north to the cities of Bukhara, Samarkand and Khiva in present-day Uzbekistan. Goods and ideas were exchanged at this center point, such as Chinese silk, Persian silver and Roman gold, while the region of present Afghanistan was mining and trading lapis lazuli stones mainly from the Badakhshan region.\nDuring the first century BCE, the Parthian Empire subjugated the region but lost it to their Indo-Parthian vassals. In the mid-to-late first century CE the vast Kushan Empire, centered in Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture, making Buddhism flourish throughout the region. The Kushans were overthrown by the Sassanids in the 3rd century CE, though the Indo-Sassanids continued to rule at least parts of the region. They were followed by the Kidarites who, in turn, was replaced by the Hephthalites. They were replaced by the Turk Shahi in the 7th century. The Buddhist Turk Shahi of Kabul was replaced by a Hindu dynasty before the Saffarids conquered the area in 870, this Hindu dynasty was called Hindu Shahi. Much of the northeastern and southern areas of the country remained dominated by Buddhist culture.\n### Medieval history\n#### Islamic conquest\nArab Muslims brought Islam to Herat and Zaranj in 642 CE and began spreading eastward; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted. Before the arrival of Islam, the region used to be home to various beliefs and cults, often resulting in Syncretism between the dominant religions such as Zoroastrianism, Buddhism or Greco-Buddhism, Ancient Iranian religions, Hinduism, Christianity and Judaism. An exemplification of the syncretism in the region would be that people were patrons of Buddhism but still worshipped local Iranian gods such as Ahura Mazda, Lady Nana, Anahita or Mihr(Mithra) and portrayed Greek Gods like Heracles or Tyche as protectors of Buddha. The Zunbils and Kabul Shahi were first conquered in 870 CE by the Saffarid Muslims of Zaranj. Later, the Samanids extended their Islamic influence south of the Hindu Kush. It is reported that Muslims and non-Muslims still lived side by side in Kabul before the Ghaznavids rose to power in the 10th century.\nBy the 11th century, Mahmud of Ghazni defeated the remaining Hindu rulers and effectively Islamized the wider region, with the exception of Kafiristan. Mahmud made Ghazni into an important city and patronized intellectuals such as the historian Al-Biruni and the poet Ferdowsi. The Ghaznavid dynasty was overthrown by the Ghurids in 1186, whose architectural achievements included the remote Minaret of Jam. The Ghurids controlled Afghanistan for less than a century before being conquered by the Khwarazmian dynasty in 1215.\n#### Mongols and Babur with the Lodi Dynasty\nIn 1219 CE, Genghis Khan and his Mongol army overran the region. His troops are said to have annihilated the Khwarazmian cities of Herat and Balkh as well as Bamyan. The destruction caused by the Mongols forced many locals to return to an agrarian rural society. Mongol rule continued with the Ilkhanate in the northwest while the Khalji dynasty administered the Afghan tribal areas south of the Hindu Kush until the invasion of Timur (aka Tamerlane), who established the Timurid Empire in 1370. Under the rule of Shah Rukh the city served as the focal point of the Timurid Renaissance, whose glory matched Florence of the Italian Renaissance as the center of a cultural rebirth.\nIn the early 16th century, Babur arrived from Ferghana and captured Kabul from the Arghun dynasty. Babur would go on to conquer the Afghan Lodi dynasty who had ruled the Delhi Sultanate in the First Battle of Panipat. Between the 16th and 18th century, the Uzbek Khanate of Bukhara, Iranian Safavids, and Indian Mughals ruled parts of the territory. During the Medieval Period, the northwestern area of Afghanistan was referred to by the regional name Khorasan. Two of the four capitals of Khorasan (Herat and Balkh) are now located in Afghanistan, while the regions of Kandahar, Zabulistan, Ghazni, Kabulistan, and Afghanistan formed the frontier between Khorasan and Hindustan. However, up to the 19th century the term Khorasan was commonly used among natives to describe their country; Sir George Elphinstone wrote with amazement that the country known to outsiders as \"Afghanistan\" was referred to by its own inhabitants as \"Khorasan\" and that the first Afghan official whom he met at the border welcomed him to Khorasan.\n## Modern history\n### Hotak Dynasty\nIn 1709, Mirwais Hotak, a local Ghilzai tribal leader, successfully rebelled against the Safavids. He defeated Gurgin Khan and established his own kingdom. Mirwais died of natural causes in 1715 and was succeeded by his brother Abdul Aziz, who was soon killed by Mirwais' son Mahmud for possibly planning to concede territories back to the Safavids. Mahmud led the Afghan army in 1722 to the Persian capital of Isfahan, captured the city after the Battle of Gulnabad and proclaimed himself King of Persia. The Afghan dynasty was ousted from Persia by Nader Shah after the 1729 Battle of Damghan.\n#### Fall of the Hotak Dynasty\nIn 1738, Nader Shah and his forces captured Kandahar in the Siege of Kandahar, the last Hotak stronghold, from Shah Hussain Hotak. Soon after, the Persian and Afghan forces invaded India, Nader Shah had plundered Delhi, alongside his 16 year old commander, Ahmad Shah Durrani who had assisted him on these campaigns. Nader Shah was assassinated in 1747.\n#### Rise of the Durrani Empire\nAfter the death of Nader Shah in 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani had returned to Kandahar with a contingent of 4,000 Pashtuns. The Abdalis had \"unanimously accepted\" Ahmad Shah as their new leader. With his acension in 1747, Ahmad Shah had led multiple campaigns against the Mughal Empire, Maratha Empire, and then receding, Afsharid Empire. Ahmad Shah had captured Kabul and Peshawar from the Mughal appointed governor, Nasir Khan. Ahmad Shah had then conquered Herat in 1750, and had also captured Kashmir in 1752. Ahmad Shah had launched two campaigns into Khorasan, (1750–1751) and (1754–1755). His first campaign had seen the siege of Mashhad, however he was forced to retreat after 4 months. In November 1750, he moved to siege Nishapur, however he was unable to capture the city and was forced to retreat in early 1751. Ahmad Shah returned in 1754, he captured Tun, and on 23 July, he sieged Mashhad once again. Mashhad had fallen on 2 December, however Shah rokh was reappointed in 1755. He was forced to give up Torshiz, Bakharz, Jam, Khaf, and Turbat-e Haidari to the Afghans. Following this, Ahmad Shah had sieged Nishapur once again, and captured it.\n#### Objectives and Invasions of India\nAhmad Shah invaded India 8 times during his reign. With the capture of Peshawar, Ahmad Shah had used this as a convenient striking point to lead his military campaigns into Punjab and India.\nAhmad Shah had sought out multiple reasons for his invasions, Ahmad Shah saw Afghanistan in a dire state, and one that needed to expand and exploit a weak but rich neighboring country, which Ahmad Shah had capitalized on in multiple opportunities during his Invasions of India, he sought the reasons needed to fill his treasury in a war-plunder conquest based economy. Ahmad Shah had launched his first invasion in 1748, crossing the indus river, his armies sacked and absorbed Lahore into the Durrani Realm. Ahmad Shah had met Mughal armies at the Battle of Manupur (1748), where he was defeated and forced to retreat to back to Afghanistan. Ahmad Shah had returned the next year in 1749, where he had captured the area around Lahore and Punjab, presenting it as an Afghan victory for this campaign. From 1749 to 1767, Ahmad Shah would lead 6 more invasions, the most important being his sixth invasion, with the Third Battle of Panipat, which created a power vacuum in northern India, halting Maratha expansion.\n### Death of Ahmad Shah and his Successors\nAhmad Shah Durrani had died in October 1772, what followed would be a civil war in succession, with his named successor, Timur Shah Durrani succeeding him after the defeat of his brother, Suleiman Mirza.\nTimur Shah Durrani ascended to the throne in November 1772, having defeated a coalition under Shah Wali Khan, the influential prime minister of the Durrani Empire, and Humayun Mirza. Timur Shah began his reign by consolidating power toward himself and people loyal to him, purging Durrani Sardars and influential tribal leaders in Kabul and Kandahar to bring support toward himself. Timur Shah's reforms also saw the capital of the Durrani Empire being shifted from Kandahar to Kabul, being able to cover the empire better as a base of ordination since it was essentially the heartland of the empire. This reform saw Kabul as the modern capital of Afghanistan today. Having consolidated power to himself, Timur Shah would fight multiple series of rebellions to consolidate and hold the empire apart, Timur Shah would also lead campaigns into Punjab against the Sikhs like his father did, however being more successful. Most prominent example of his battles during this campaign would be where Timur Shah led his forces under Zangi Khan Durrani, with over 18,000 men total of Afghan, Qizilbash, and Mongol cavalrymen. Against over 60,000 Sikh men. The Sikhs would lose over 30,000 in this battle and would stage a Durrani resurgence in Punjab. The Durranis lost Multan in 1772 after Ahmad Shah's death, following this victory by Timur Shah, Timur Shah was able to lay siege to Multan and recapture it, incorporating it into the Durrani empire once again, reintegrating it as a province until the Siege of Multan (1818). Timur Shah would be succeeded by his son, Zaman Shah Durrani after his death on 18 or 20 May 1793. Timur Shah's reign oversaw the attempted stabilization and consolidation of the empire. However, Timur Shah had over 24 sons, a mistake that would plunge the empire in civil war over succession crises.\nZaman Shah Durrani would succeed to the Durrani Throne following the death of his father, Timur Shah Durrani. This instigated civil war with his brothers, Mahmud Shah Durrani, and Humayun Mirza revolting against him. With Humayun centered in Kandahar, and Mahmud Shah centered in Herat. Zaman Shah would defeat Humayun and also force the loyalty of Mahmud Shah Durrani. Securing his position on the throne, Zaman Shah had led 3 campaigns into Punjab, with the first two campaigns capturing Lahore, but being forced to retreat due to issues from a possible Qajar invasion, or his brother, Mahmud Shah Durrani revolting. Zaman Shah embarked on his third campaign for Punjab in 1800 to deal with a rebellious Ranjit Singh. However, he was forced to withdraw, with his brother, Mahmud Shah Durrani revolting, Zaman Shah would be toppled from his reign, replaced by his brother, Mahmud Shah Durrani. However, just under 2 years in his reign, Mahmud Shah Durrani would be deposed by his brother, Shah Shuja Durrani, on 13 July 1803. Shah Shuja would attempt to consolidate the Durrani Realm, which had been long striven by civil war. Shah Shuja would later be deposed by his brother at the Battle of Nimla (1809), where Mahmud Shah Durrani would defeat and force Shah Shuja to flee, with Shah Mahmud usurping the throne again for his second reign beginning on 3 May 1809.\n#### Barakzai dynasty and British wars\nBy the early 19th century, the Afghan empire was under threat from the Persians in the west and the Sikh Empire in the east. Fateh Khan, leader of the Barakzai tribe, installed many of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire, mostly ruling as governors of major cities and provinces. After his murder for apparent treason against the Durrani king. Fateh Khan would be sentenced by Mahmud Shah Durrani, having him executed. His brothers rebelled and divided up the provinces of the empire between themselves. During this turbulent period, Afghanistan had fractured into many states, this included the Principality of Qandahar, Emirate of Herat, Khanate of Qunduz, Maimana Khanate, and many more states. The most prominent state being the Emirate of Kabul, ruled by Dost Mohammad Khan after he declared himself emir and was bestowed upon the title of Amir al-Mu'minin in summer 1826 following a usurpation of the throne from his brother, Sultan Mohammad Khan. With the collapse of the Durrani Empire, and the exile of the Sadozai Dynasty while Afghanistan was in this turbulent period of civil war, Punjab and Kashmir were lost to Ranjit Singh ruler of the Sikh Empire, who invaded Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in March 1823 and captured the city of Peshawar from the Peshawar Sardars (one of the many entities that split following the collapse of the Durrani Empire), at the Battle of Nowshera. In 1837, Dost Mohammad Khan attempted to retake Peshawar and sent a large force under his son, Wazir Akbar Khan, leading to the Battle of Jamrud near the Khyber Pass. Akbar Khan and the Afghan army failed to capture the Jamrud Fort from the Sikh Khalsa Army, but killed Sikh Commander Hari Singh Nalwa, thus ending the Afghan-Sikh Wars. By this time the British were advancing from the east, conquering the Sikh Empire after it had its own period of turbulence following the death of Ranjit Singh, directly bringing the Emirate of Kabul to conflict in the first major conflict during \"the Great Game\".\nIn 1838, a British expeditionary force marched into Afghanistan, invading the Principality of Qandahar, and in August 1839, seized Kabul, forcing Dost Mohammad into exile with other factions and rebels in Afghanistan, while he was replaced with the former Durrani ruler Shah Shuja Durrani as the new ruler of Kabul, and unbeknownst to him, a de facto puppet on the throne. Following an uprising that saw the assassination of Shah Shuja, the 1842 retreat from Kabul of British-Indian forces and the annihilation of Elphinstone's army, and the punitive expedition of The battle of Kabul that led to its sacking, the British gave up on their attempts to try and subjugate Afghanistan, and allowed Dost Mohammad Khan to return as ruler and withdrew their military forces from Afghanistan. Dost Mohammad Khan would spend most of his reign consolidating the parts of Afghanistan that were lost in the Durrani-Barakzai civil wars. Dost Mohammad Khan would launch numerous campaigns after returning to rule in 1842, ruling only from Kabul, Ghazni, and other cities when he had returned. Dost Mohammad united most of the Afghan realm in his reign, securing the last major state, Herat, in the Herat Campaign of 1862–63. Dost Mohammad died on 9 June 1863, a few weeks after his campaign to capture Herat. Dost Mohammad's successors would fight for the throne of Afghanistan, between Sher Ali Khan, Mohammad Afzal Khan, and Mohammad Azam Khan in the Afghan Civil War (1863–1869). Sher Ali would win this civil war and would go on to rule the realm until In 1878, the British had returned in the Second Anglo-Afghan War which was fought over perceived Russian influence in the region, Abdur Rahman Khan replaced Ayub Khan who had succeeded Sher Ali Khan after his death in 1879. Britain would gain control of Afghanistan's foreign relations as part of the Treaty of Gandamak of 1879, making it an official British Protected State. In 1893, Amir Abdur Rahman signed an agreement in which the ethnic Pashtun and Baloch territories were divided by the Durand Line, which forms the modern-day border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Shia-dominated Hazarajat and pagan Kafiristan remained politically independent until being conquered by Abdur Rahman Khan in 1891–1896. He was known as the \"Iron Amir\" for his features and his ruthless methods against tribes. The Iron Amir viewed railway and telegraph lines coming from the Russian and British as \"trojan horses\" and therefore prevented railway development in Afghanistan. He died in 1901, succeeded by his son, Habibullah Khan.\nHow can a small power like Afghanistan, which is like a goat between these lions  or a grain of wheat between two strong millstones of the grinding mill,  stand in the midway of the stones without being ground to dust?— Abdur Rahman Khan, the \"Iron Amir\", in 1900\nDuring the First World War, when Afghanistan was neutral, Habibullah Khan was met by officials of the Central Powers in the Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition, to declare full independence from the United Kingdom, join them and attack British India, as part of the Hindu–German Conspiracy. Their efforts to bring Afghanistan into the Central Powers failed, but it caused discontent among the population for keeping neutrality against the British. Habibullah was assassinated during a hunting trip in February 1919, and Amanullah Khan eventually assumed power. A staunch supporter of the 1915–1916 expeditions, Amanullah Khan provoked the Third Anglo-Afghan War, entering British India via the Khyber Pass.\nAfter the end of the Third Anglo-Afghan War and the signing of the Treaty of Rawalpindi on 19 August 1919, Emir Amanullah Khan declared the Emirate of Afghanistan a sovereign and fully independent state. He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community, particularly with the Soviet Union and the Weimar Republic of Germany. He proclaimed himself King of Afghanistan on 9 June 1926, when the Emirate of Afghanistan became the Kingdom of Afghanistan. Following a 1927–28 tour of Europe and Turkey, he introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was Mahmud Tarzi, an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's 1923 constitution, which made elementary education compulsory. The institution of slavery was abolished in the Emirate of Afghanistan in 1923. King Amanullah's wife, Queen Soraya, was an important figure during this period in the fight for woman's education and against their oppression.\nSome of the reforms that were put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional burqa for women and the opening of several co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders, and this led to the Afghan Civil War (1928–1929). Faced with the overwhelming armed opposition, King Amanullah abdicated in January 1929, and soon after Kabul fell to Saqqawist forces led by Habibullah Kalakani. Prince Mohammed Nadir Shah, Amanullah's cousin, in turn defeated and killed Kalakani in October 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of King Amanullah in favor of a more gradual approach to modernization, but was assassinated in 1933 by Abdul Khaliq, a fifteen-year-old Hazara student who was an Amanullah loyalist.\nMohammed Zahir Shah, Nadir Shah's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned as King from 1933 to 1973. The tribal revolts of 1944–1947 saw King Zahir's reign challenged by Zadran, Safi, Mangal, and Wazir tribesmen led by Mazrak Zadran, Salemai, and Mirzali Khan, among others, many of whom were Amanullah loyalists. Close relations with the Muslim states Turkey, the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq and Iran/Persia were also pursued, while further international relations were sought by joining the League of Nations in 1934. The 1930s saw the development of roads, infrastructure, the founding of a national bank, and increased education. Road links in the north played a large part in a growing cotton and textile industry. The country built close relationships with the Axis powers, with Nazi Germany having the largest share in Afghan development at the time, along with the Kingdom of Italy and the Empire of Japan.\n### Contemporary history\nUntil 1946, King Zahir ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of Prime Minister and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another of Zahir Shah's uncles, Shah Mahmud Khan, became Prime Minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. He was replaced in 1953 by Mohammed Daoud Khan, the king's cousin and brother-in-law, and a Pashtun nationalist who sought the creation of a Pashtunistan, leading to highly tense relations with Pakistan. During his ten years at the post until 1963, Daoud Khan pressed for social modernization reforms and sought a closer relationship with the Soviet Union. Afterward, the 1964 constitution was formed, and the first non-royal Prime Minister was sworn in.\nKing Zahir Shah, like his father Nadir Shah, had a policy of maintaining national independence while pursuing gradual modernization, creating nationalist feeling, and improving relations with the United Kingdom. However, Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in World War II nor aligned with either power bloc in the Cold War thereafter. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports, and other vital infrastructure in the post-war period. On a per capita basis, Afghanistan received more Soviet development aid than any other country. Afghanistan had, therefore, good relations with both Cold War enemies. In 1973, while the King was in Italy, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first President of Afghanistan, abolishing the monarchy.\n#### Democratic Republic and Soviet war\nIn April 1978, the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in a bloody coup d'état against then-President Mohammed Daoud Khan, in what is called the Saur Revolution. The PDPA declared the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, with its first leader named as People's Democratic Party general secretary Nur Muhammad Taraki. This would trigger a series of events that would dramatically turn Afghanistan from a poor and secluded (albeit peaceful) country to a hotbed of international terrorism. The PDPA initiated various social, symbolic and land distribution reforms that provoked strong opposition, while also brutally oppressing political dissidents. This caused unrest and quickly expanded into a state of civil war by 1979, waged by guerrilla mujahideen (and smaller Maoist guerrillas) against regime forces countrywide. It quickly turned into a proxy war as the Pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers, the United States supported them through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA regime. Meanwhile, there was increasingly hostile friction between the competing factions of the PDPA – the dominant Khalq and the more moderate Parcham.\nIn September 1979, PDPA General Secretary Taraki was assassinated in an internal coup orchestrated by fellow Khalq member, then-prime minister Hafizullah Amin, who assumed the new general secretary of the People's Democratic Party. The situation in the country deteriorated under Amin and thousands of people went missing. Displeased with Amin's government, the Soviet Army invaded the country in December 1979, heading for Kabul and killing Amin just three days later. A Soviet-organized regime, led by Parcham's Babrak Karmal but inclusive of both factions (Parcham and Khalq), filled the vacuum. Soviet troops in more substantial numbers were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal, marking the beginning of the Soviet–Afghan War. The United States and Pakistan, along with smaller actors like Saudi Arabia and China, continued supporting the rebels, delivering billions of dollars in cash and weapons including two thousand FIM-92 Stinger surface-to-air missiles. Lasting nine years, the war caused the deaths of between 562,000 and 2 million Afghans, and displaced about 6 million people who subsequently fled Afghanistan, mainly to Pakistan and Iran. Heavy air bombardment destroyed many countryside villages, millions of landmines were planted, and some cities such as Herat and Kandahar were also damaged from bombardment. Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province functioned as an organizational and networking base for the anti-Soviet Afghan resistance, with the province's influential Deobandi ulama playing a major supporting role in promoting the 'jihad'. After the Soviet withdrawal, the civil war ensued until the communist regime under People's Democratic Party leader Mohammad Najibullah collapsed in 1992.\nThe Soviet-Afghan War had drastic social effects on Afghanistan. The militarization of society led to heavily armed police, private bodyguards, openly armed civil defense groups and other such things becoming the norm in Afghanistan for decades thereafter. The traditional power structure had shifted from clergy, community elders, intelligentsia and military in favor of powerful warlords.\n#### Post–Cold War conflict\nAnother civil war broke out after the creation of a dysfunctional coalition government between leaders of various mujahideen factions. Amid a state of anarchy and factional infighting, various mujahideen factions committed widespread rape, murder and extortion, while Kabul was heavily bombarded and partially destroyed by the fighting. Several failed reconciliations and alliances occurred between different leaders. The Taliban emerged in September 1994 as a movement and militia of students (talib) from Islamic madrassas (schools) in Pakistan, who soon had military support from Pakistan. Taking control of Kandahar city that year, they conquered more territories until finally driving out the government of Rabbani from Kabul in 1996, where they established an emirate that gained international recognition from 3 countries: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The Taliban were condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which resulted in the brutal treatment of many Afghans, especially women. During their rule, the Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians, denied UN food supplies to starving civilians and conducted a policy of scorched earth, burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes.\nAfter the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, Ahmad Shah Massoud and Abdul Rashid Dostum formed the Northern Alliance, later joined by others, to resist the Taliban. Dostum's forces were defeated by the Taliban during the Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif in 1997 and 1998; Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff, Pervez Musharraf, began sending thousands of Pakistanis to help the Taliban defeat the Northern Alliance. By 2000 the Northern Alliance only controlled 10% of territory, cornered in the north-east. On 9 September 2001, Massoud was assassinated by two Arab suicide attackers in Panjshir Valley. Around 400,000 Afghans died in internal conflicts between 1990 and 2001.\n#### US invasion and Islamic Republic\nIn October 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan to remove the Taliban from power after they refused to hand over Osama Bin Laden, the prime suspect of the September 11 attacks, who was a \"guest\" of the Taliban and was operating his al-Qaeda network in Afghanistan. The majority of Afghans supported the American invasion of their country. During the initial invasion, US and UK forces bombed al-Qaeda training camps, and later working with the Northern Alliance, the Taliban regime came to an end.\nIn December 2001, after the Taliban government was overthrown, the Afghan Interim Administration under Hamid Karzai was formed. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was established by the UN Security Council to help assist the Karzai administration and provide basic security. By this time, after two decades of war as well as an acute famine at the time, Afghanistan had one of the highest infant and child mortality rates in the world, the lowest life expectancy, much of the population were hungry, and infrastructure was in ruins. Many foreign donors started providing aid and assistance to rebuild the war-torn country.\nTaliban forces meanwhile began regrouping inside Pakistan, while more coalition troops entered Afghanistan to help the rebuilding process. The Taliban began an insurgency to regain control of Afghanistan. Over the next decade, ISAF and Afghan troops led many offensives against the Taliban, but failed to fully defeat them. Afghanistan remained one of the poorest countries in the world because of a lack of foreign investment, government corruption, and the Taliban insurgency.\nMeanwhile, Karzai attempted to unite the peoples of the country, and the Afghan government was able to build some democratic structures, adopting a constitution in 2004 with the name Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Attempts were made, often with the support of foreign donor countries, to improve the country's economy, healthcare, education, transport, and agriculture. ISAF forces also began to train the Afghan National Security Forces. Following 2002, nearly five million Afghans were repatriated. The number of NATO troops present in Afghanistan peaked at 140,000 in 2011, dropping to about 16,000 in 2018.\nIn September 2014 Ashraf Ghani became president after the 2014 presidential election where for the first time in Afghanistan's history power was democratically transferred. On 28 December 2014, NATO formally ended ISAF combat operations in Afghanistan and transferred full security responsibility to the Afghan government. The NATO-led Operation Resolute Support was formed the same day as a successor to ISAF. Thousands of NATO troops remained in the country to train and advise Afghan government forces and continue their fight against the Taliban. It was estimated in 2015 that \"about 147,000 people have been killed in the Afghanistan war since 2001. More than 38,000 of those killed have been civilians\". A report titled Body Count concluded that 106,000–170,000 civilians had been killed as a result of the fighting in Afghanistan at the hands of all parties to the conflict.\nOn 19 February 2020, the US–Taliban deal was made in Qatar. The 2020 US–Taliban deal was one of the critical events that caused the collapse of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF); following the signing of the deal, the US dramatically reduced the number of air attacks and deprived the ANSF of a critical edge in fighting the Taliban insurgency, leading to the Taliban takeover of Kabul.\n#### Second Taliban era (2021–present)\nOn 14 April 2021, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan by 1 May. Soon after the withdrawal of NATO troops started, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government, quickly advancing in front of collapsing Afghan government forces. On 15 August 2021, as the Taliban once again controlled a vast majority of Afghan territory, they re-captured the capital city of Kabul, and many civilians, government officials and foreign diplomats were evacuated. President Ghani fled Afghanistan that day. As of 16 August 2021, an unofficial Coordination Council led by senior statesmen was in the process of coordinating the transfer of the state institutions of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to the Taliban. On 17 August, the First Vice President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Amrullah Saleh, proclaimed himself the caretaker President of Afghanistan and announced the formation of an anti-Taliban front with a reported 6,000+ troops in the Panjshir Valley, along with Ahmad Massoud. However, on 6 September, the Taliban took control of most of the Panjshir province, with resistance fighters retreating to the mountains to continue fighting within the province. Fights in the valley ceased mid-September, while resistance leaders Amrullah Saleh and Ahmad Massoud fled to neighboring Tajikistan.\nTaliban rule was swiftly restored as its opponents were defeated or left the country. Declaring an \"Islamic Emirate\", it is apparently led by supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada and acting Prime Minister Hasan Akhund, who took office on 7 September 2021. Akhund is one of the four founders of the Taliban and was a deputy Prime Minister in their previous Emirate; his appointment was seen as a compromise between moderates and hardliners. A new, all-male cabinet was formed including Abdul Hakim Ishaqzai as Minister of Justice. On 20 September 2021, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres received a letter from acting minister of Foreign Affairs Amir Khan Muttaqi to formally claim Afghanistan's seat as a member state for their official spokesman in Doha, Suhail Shaheen, and asked to address the General Assembly. During the previous Taliban rule from 1996 to 2001, the United Nations never recognized their representatives and chose to work with the then-government in exile instead.\nWestern nations have suspended most humanitarian aid to Afghanistan following the Taliban's takeover of the country in August 2021 and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund also halted payments. In October 2021, more than half of Afghanistan's 39 million people faced an acute food shortage. On 11 November 2021, the Human Rights Watch reported that Afghanistan was facing widespread famine due to an economic and banking crisis.\nThough the state of war in the country has ended as of 2021, armed conflict persists in some regions amid fighting between the Taliban and the local branch of the Islamic State, as well as an anti-Taliban Republican insurgency. A year into Taliban rule, former president Hamid Karzai said in an interview: \"In terms of  end to widespread fighting and conflict, we are happy — there's more stability, there's more security. But in terms of Afghanistan having a government that all Afghan people find themselves , we still have a way to go. In terms of the economy of the country, it's a disaster.\"\n## Geography\nAfghanistan is located in Southern-Central Asia. The region centered at Afghanistan is considered the \"crossroads of Asia\", and the country has had the nickname Heart of Asia. The renowned Urdu poet Allama Iqbal once wrote about the country:\nAsia is a body of water and earth, of which the Afghan nation is the heart. From its discord, the discord of Asia; and from its accord, the accord of Asia.\nAt over 652,864 km2 (252,072 sq mi), Afghanistan is the world's 41st largest country, slightly bigger than France and smaller than Myanmar, and about the size of Texas in the United States. There is no coastline, as Afghanistan is landlocked. Afghanistan shares its longest land border (the Durand Line) with Pakistan to the east and south, followed by borders with Tajikistan to the north-east, Iran to the west, Turkmenistan to the north-west, Uzbekistan to the north and China to the north-east; India recognizes a border with Afghanistan through Pakistani-administered Kashmir. Clockwise from south-west, Afghanistan shares borders with the Sistan and Baluchestan Province, South Khorasan Province and Razavi Khorasan Province of Iran; Ahal Region, Mary Region and Lebap Region of Turkmenistan; Surxondaryo Region of Uzbekistan; Khatlon Region and Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region of Tajikistan; Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China; and the Gilgit-Baltistan territory, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and Balochistan province of Pakistan.\nThe geography in Afghanistan is varied, but is mostly mountainous and rugged, with some unusual mountain ridges accompanied by plateaus and river basins. It is dominated by the Hindu Kush range, the western extension of the Himalayas that stretches to eastern Tibet via the Pamir Mountains and Karakoram Mountains in Afghanistan's far north-east. Most of the highest points are in the east consisting of fertile mountain valleys, often considered part of the \"Roof of the World\". The Hindu Kush ends at the west-central highlands, creating plains in the north and southwest, namely the Turkestan Plains and the Sistan Basin; these two regions consist of rolling grasslands and semi-deserts, and hot windy deserts, respectively. Forests exist in the corridor between Nuristan and Paktika provinces (see East Afghan montane conifer forests), and tundra in the north-east. The country's highest point is Noshaq, at 7,492 m (24,580 ft) above sea level. The lowest point lies in Jowzjan Province along the Amu River bank, at 258 m (846 ft) above sea level.\nDespite having numerous rivers and reservoirs, large parts of the country are dry. The endorheic Sistan Basin is one of the driest regions in the world. The Amu Darya rises at the north of the Hindu Kush, while the nearby Hari Rud flows west towards Herat, and the Arghandab River from the central region southwards. To the south and west of the Hindu Kush flow a number of streams that are tributaries of the Indus River, such as the Helmand River. One exception is the Kabul River which flows in an easterly direction to the Indus ending at the Indian Ocean. Afghanistan receives heavy snow during the winter in the Hindu Kush and Pamir Mountains, and the melting snow in the spring season enters the rivers, lakes, and streams. However, two-thirds of the country's water flows into the neighboring countries of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan. As reported in 2010, the state needs more than US$2 billion to rehabilitate its irrigation systems so that the water is properly managed.\nThe northeastern Hindu Kush mountain range, in and around the Badakhshan Province of Afghanistan, is in a geologically active area where earthquakes may occur almost every year. They can be deadly and destructive, causing landslides in some parts or avalanches during the winter. The last strong earthquakes were in 1998, which killed about 6,000 people in Badakhshan near Tajikistan. This was followed by the 2002 Hindu Kush earthquakes in which over 150 people were killed and over 1,000 injured. A 2010 earthquake left 11 Afghans dead, over 70 injured, and more than 2,000 houses destroyed. In June 2022, a destructive 5.9 earthquake struck near the border with Pakistan, killing at least 1,150 people and sparking fears of a major humanitarian crisis.\n### Climate\nAfghanistan has a continental climate with harsh winters in the central highlands, the glaciated northeast (around Nuristan), and the Wakhan Corridor, where the average temperature in January is below −15 °C (5 °F) and can reach −26 °C (−15 °F), and hot summers in the low-lying areas of the Sistan Basin of the southwest, the Jalalabad basin in the east, and the Turkestan plains along the Amu River in the north, where temperatures average over 35 °C (95 °F) in July and can go over 43 °C (109 °F). The country is generally arid in the summers, with most rainfall falling between December and April. The lower areas of northern and western Afghanistan are the driest, with precipitation more common in the east. Although proximate to India, Afghanistan is mostly outside the monsoon zone, except the Nuristan Province which occasionally receives summer monsoon rain.\n### Biodiversity\nSeveral types of mammals exist throughout Afghanistan. Snow leopards, Siberian tigers and brown bears live in the high elevation alpine tundra regions. The Marco Polo sheep exclusively live in the Wakhan Corridor region of north-east Afghanistan. Foxes, wolves, otters, deer, wild sheep, lynx and other big cats populate the mountain forest region of the east. In the semi-desert northern plains, wildlife include a variety of birds, hedgehogs, gophers, and large carnivores such as jackals and hyenas.\nGazelles, wild pigs and jackals populate the steppe plains of the south and west, while mongoose and cheetahs exist in the semi-desert south. Marmots and ibex also live in the high mountains of Afghanistan, and pheasants exist in some parts of the country. The Afghan hound is a native breed of dog known for its fast speed and its long hair; it is relatively known in the west.\nEndemic fauna of Afghanistan includes the Afghan flying squirrel, Afghan snowfinch, Afghanodon (or the \"Paghman mountain salamander\"), Stigmella kasyi, Vulcaniella kabulensis, Afghan leopard gecko, Wheeleria parviflorellus, amongst others. Endemic flora include Iris afghanica. Afghanistan has a wide variety of birds despite its relatively arid climate – an estimated 460 species of which 235 breed within.\nThe forest region of Afghanistan has vegetation such as pine trees, spruce trees, fir trees and larches, whereas the steppe grassland regions consist of broadleaf trees, short grass, perennial plants and shrublands. The colder high elevation regions are composed of hardy grasses and small flowering plants. Several regions are designated protected areas; there are three national parks: Band-e Amir, Wakhan and Nuristan. Afghanistan had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.85/10, ranking it 15th globally out of 172 countries.\n## Demographics\nThe population of Afghanistan was estimated at 32.9 million as of 2019 by the Afghanistan Statistics and Information Authority, whereas the UN estimates over 38.0 million. In 1979 the total population was reported to be about 15.5 million. About 23.9% of them are urbanite, 71.4% live in rural areas, and the remaining 4.7% are nomadic. An additional 3 million or so Afghans are temporarily housed in neighboring Pakistan and Iran, most of whom were born and raised in those two countries. As of 2013, Afghanistan was the largest refugee-producing country in the world, a title held for 32 years.\nThe current population growth rate is 2.37%, one of the highest in the world outside of Africa. This population is expected to reach 82 million by 2050 if current population trends continue. The population of Afghanistan increased steadily until the 1980s, when civil war caused millions to flee to other countries such as Pakistan. Millions have since returned and the war conditions contribute to the country having the highest fertility rate outside Africa. Afghanistan's healthcare has recovered since the turn of the century, causing falls in infant mortality and increases in life expectancy, although it has the lowest life expectance of any country outside Africa. This (along with other factors such as returning refugees) caused rapid population growth in the 2000s that has only recently started to slow down. The Gini coefficient in 2008 was 27.8.\n### Ethnicity and languages\nAfghans are divided into several ethnolinguistic groups. Off of sociological research data by The Asia Foundation in 2019, the Pashtuns are the largest ethnic group, comprising 39%, followed by Tajiks, comprising 37%. of the country's population. The other two major ethnic groups are the Hazaras and Uzbeks. A further 10 other ethnic groups are recognized and each are represented in the Afghan National Anthem.\nDari and Pashto are the official languages of Afghanistan; bilingualism is very common. Dari, which is a variety of and mutually intelligible with Persian (and very often called 'Farsi' by some Afghans like in Iran) functions as the lingua franca in Kabul as well as in much of the northern and northwestern parts of the country. Native speakers of Dari, of any ethnicity, are sometimes called Farsiwans. Pashto is the native tongue of the Pashtuns, although many of them are also fluent in Dari while some non-Pashtuns are fluent in Pashto. Despite the Pashtuns having been dominant in Afghan politics for centuries, Dari remained the preferred language for government and bureaucracy. According to CIA World Factbook, Dari Persian is spoken by 78% (L1 + L2) and functions as the lingua franca, while Pashto is spoken by 50%, Uzbek 10%, English 5%, Turkmen 2%, Urdu 2%, Pashayi 1%, Nuristani 1%, Arabic 1%, and Balochi 1% (2021 est). Data represent the most widely spoken languages; shares sum to more than 100% because there is much bilingualism in the country and because respondents were allowed to select more than one language.There are a number of smaller regional languages, including Uzbek, Turkmen, Balochi, Pashayi, and Nuristani.\nWhen it comes to foreign languages among the populace, many are able to speak or understand Hindustani (Urdu-Hindi), partly due to returning Afghan refugees from Pakistan and the popularity of Bollywood films respectively. English is also understood by some of the population, and has been gaining popularity as of the 2000s. Some Afghans retain some ability in Russian, which was taught in public schools during the 1980s.\n### Religion\nThe CIA estimated in 2009 that 99.7% of the Afghan population was Muslim and most are thought to adhere to the Sunni Hanafi school. According to Pew Research Center, as much as 90% are of the Sunni denomination, 7% Shia and 3% non-denominational. The CIA Factbook variously estimates up to 89.7% Sunni or up to 15% Shia.\nAfghan Sikhs and Hindus are also found in certain major cities (namely Kabul, Jalalabad, Ghazni, Kandahar) accompanied by gurdwaras and mandirs. According to Deutsche Welle in September 2021, 250 remain in the country after 67 were evacuated to India.\nThere was a small Jewish community in Afghanistan, living mainly in Herat and Kabul. Over the years, this small community was forced leave due to decades of warfare and religious persecution. By the end of the twentieth century, the entire community had emigrated to Israel and the United States, with the exception of one person, Herat-born Zablon Simintov. He remained for years, being the caretaker of the only remaining Afghan synagogue. After the second Taliban takeover, he left Afghanistan for the United States.\nAfghan Christians, who number 500–8,000, practice their faith secretly due to intense societal opposition, and there are no public churches.\n### Urbanization\nAs estimated by the CIA World Factbook, 26% of the population was urbanized as of 2020. This is one of the lowest figures in the world; in Asia it is only higher than Cambodia, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Urbanization has increased rapidly, particularly in the capital Kabul, due to returning refugees from Pakistan and Iran after 2001, internally displaced people, and rural migrants. Urbanization in Afghanistan is different from typical urbanization in that it is centered on just a few cities.\nThe only city with over a million residents is its capital, Kabul, located in the east of the country. The other large cities are located generally in the \"ring\" around the Central Highlands, namely Kandahar in the south, Herat in the west, Mazar-i-Sharif and Kunduz in the north, and Jalalabad in the east.\n### Education\nEducation in Afghanistan includes K–12 and higher education, which is overseen by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education. There are over 16,000 schools in the country and roughly 9 million students. Of this, about 60% are males and 40% females. However, the new regime has thus far forbidden girls and female teachers from returning to secondary schools. Over 174,000 students are enrolled in different universities around the country. About 21% of these are females. Former Education Minister Ghulam Farooq Wardak had stated that construction of 8,000 schools is required for the remaining children who are deprived of formal learning. As of 2018 the literacy rate of the population age 15 and older is 43.02% (males 55.48% and females 29.81%).\nThe top universities in Afghanistan are the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF) followed by Kabul University (KU), both of which are located in Kabul. The National Military Academy of Afghanistan, modeled after the United States Military Academy at West Point, was a four-year military development institution dedicated to graduating officers for the Afghan Armed Forces. The Afghan Defense University was constructed near Qargha in Kabul. Major universities outside of Kabul include Kandahar University in the south, Herat University in the northwest, Balkh University and Kunduz University in the north, Nangarhar University and Khost University in the east. Kabul University was founded in 1932 and is a respected institute that played a significant part in the country's education; from the 1960s the Kabul University was also a hotbed of radical political ideologies such as Marxism and Islamism, which played major parts in society, politics and the war that began in 1978.\nAfter the Taliban regained power in 2021, it became unclear to what extent female education would continue in the country. In March 2022, after they had been closed for some time, it was announced that girl's schools after 6th grade would be reopened shortly. However, shortly before reopening, the order was rescinded and schools for older girls remained closed.\n### Health\nAccording to the Human Development Index, Afghanistan is the 15th least developed country in the world. The average life expectancy is estimated to be around 60 years. The country's maternal mortality rate is 396 deaths/100,000 live births and its infant mortality rate is 66 to 112.8 deaths in every 1,000 live births. The Ministry of Public Health plans to cut the infant mortality rate to 400 for every 100,000 live births before 2020. The country has more than 3,000 midwives, with an additional 300 to 400 being trained each year.\nThere are over 100 hospitals in Afghanistan, with the most advanced treatments being available in Kabul. The French Medical Institute for Children and Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital in Kabul are the leading children's hospitals in the country. Some of the other leading hospitals in Kabul include the Jamhuriat Hospital and Jinnah Hospital. In spite of all this, many Afghans travel to Pakistan and India for advanced treatment.\nIt was reported in 2006 that nearly 60% of the Afghan population lives within a two-hour walk of the nearest health facility. Disability rate is also high in Afghanistan due to the decades of war. It was reported recently that about 80,000 people are missing limbs. Non-governmental charities such as Save the Children and Mahboba's Promise assist orphans in association with governmental structures. Demographic and Health Surveys is working with the Indian Institute of Health Management Research and others to conduct a survey in Afghanistan focusing on maternal death, among other things.\n## Governance\nFollowing the effective collapse of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan during the 2021 Taliban offensive, the Taliban declared the country an Islamic Emirate. A new caretaker government was announced on 7 September. As of 8 September 2021, no other country had formally recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as the de jure government of Afghanistan.\nA traditional instrument of governance in Afghanistan is the loya jirga (grand assembly), a Pashtun consultative meeting that was mainly organized for choosing a new head of state, adopting a new constitution, or to settle national or regional issue such as war. Loya jirgas have been held since at least 1747, with the most recent one occurring in August 2020.\n### Development of Taliban government\nOn 17 August 2021, the leader of the Taliban-affiliated Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin party, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, met with both Hamid Karzai, the former President of Afghanistan, and Abdullah Abdullah, the former chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation and former Chief Executive, in Doha, Qatar, with the aim of forming a national unity government. President Ashraf Ghani, having fled the country during the Taliban advance to either Tajikistan or Uzbekistan, emerged in the United Arab Emirates and said that he supported such negotiations and was in talks to return to Afghanistan. Many figures within the Taliban generally agreed that continuation of the 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan may, if correctly applied, be workable as the basis for the new religious state as their objections to the former government were political, and not religious.\nHours after the final flight of American troops left Kabul on 30 August, a Taliban official interviewed said that a new government would likely be announced as early as Friday 3 September after Jumu'ah. It was added that Hibatullah Akhundzada would be officially named Emir, with cabinet ministers being revealed at the Arg in an official ceremony. Abdul Ghani Baradar would be named head of government as Prime Minister, while other important positions would go to Sirajuddin Haqqani and Mullah Yaqoob. Beneath the supreme leader, day-to-day governance will be entrusted to the cabinet.\nAccording to CNN, the new government is likely to be a unitary Deobandist Islamic republic. In a report by CNN-News18, sources said the new government was going to be governed similarly to Iran with Haibatullah Akhundzada as supreme leader similar to the role of Saayid Ali Khamenei, and would be based out of Kandahar. Baradar or Yaqoob would be head of government as Prime Minister. The government's ministries and agencies will be under a cabinet presided over by the Prime Minister. The Supreme Leader would preside over an executive body known Supreme Council with anywhere from 11 to 72 members. Abdul Hakim Ishaqzai is likely to be promoted to Chief Justice. According to the report, the new government will take place within the framework of an amended 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan.\nHowever, later interviews disclosed to News18 that negotiations were not yet completed and that representatives were still in Kandahar, and that the announcement of the new government would not take place until 4 September or later. Government formation was further delayed with the announcement postponed to some time during the week of 6 September, due to concerns about forming a broad-based government acceptable to the international community. It was later added however that the Taliban's Rahbari Shura, the group's leadership council was divided between the hardline Haqqani Network and moderate Abdul Ghani Baradar over appointments needed to form an \"inclusive\" government. This culminated in a skirmish which led to Baradar being injured and treated in Pakistan. It was speculated that the government would be announced on 11 September 2021, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, with invitations possibly being extended to the governments of Turkey, China, Iran, Pakistan, and Qatar.\nAs of early September, the Taliban were planning the Cabinet to be men-only, stating that women would not be allowed to \"work in high-ranking posts\" in the government and that women were \"ruled out\" from the Cabinet. Journalists and other human rights activists, mostly women, protested in Herat and Kabul, calling for women to be included in the Cabinet. The acting Cabinet announced on 7 September was men-only, and the Ministry of Women's Affairs appeared to have been abolished. On March 23, 2022, there were reports a cabinet shakeup was underway as another meeting of the Leadership Council was held in Kandahar for the second time since the Taliban Islamic Movement came to power as a way to get international recognition. The last meeting of the Leadership Council was held from August 28, 2021, to August 30, 2021.\n### Administrative divisions\nAfghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces (wilayat). Each province has a governor and a capital. The country is further divided into nearly 400 provincial districts, each of which normally covers a city or several villages. Each district is represented by a district governor.\nThe provincial governors are now appointed by the Prime Minister of Afghanistan, and the district governors are selected by the provincial governors. The provincial governors are representatives of the central government in Kabul and are responsible for all administrative and formal issues within their provinces. There are also provincial councils that are elected through direct and general elections for four years. The functions of provincial councils are to take part in provincial development planning and to participate in the monitoring and appraisal of other provincial governance institutions.\nAccording to article 140 of the constitution and the presidential decree on electoral law, mayors of cities should be elected through free and direct elections for a four-year term. In practice however, mayors are appointed by the government.\nThe following is a list of all the 34 provinces in alphabetical order:\n### Foreign relations\nAfghanistan became a member of the United Nations in 1946. Historically, Afghanistan had strong relations with Germany, one of the first countries to recognize Afghanistan's independence in 1919; the Soviet Union, which provided much aid and military training for Afghanistan's forces and includes the signing of a Treaty of Friendship in 1921 and 1978; and India, with which a friendship treaty was signed in 1950. Relations with Pakistan have often been tense for various reasons such as the Durand Line border issue and alleged Pakistani involvement in Afghan insurgent groups.\nThe present Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is currently internationally unrecognized, but has had notable unofficial ties with China, Pakistan, and Qatar. Under the previous Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, it enjoyed cordial relations with a number of NATO and allied nations, particularly the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and Turkey. In 2012, the United States and the then-republic in Afghanistan signed their Strategic Partnership Agreement in which Afghanistan became a major non-NATO ally. Such qualification was rescinded by US President Joe Biden in July 2022.\n### Military\nThe Armed Forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan captured a large amount of weapons, hardware, vehicles, aerocrafts, and equipment from the Afghan National Security Forces following the 2021 Taliban offensive and the Fall of Kabul. The total value of the captured equipment has been estimated at US$83 billion.\n### Human rights\nHomosexuality is taboo in Afghan society; according to the Penal Code, homosexual intimacy is punished by up to a year in prison. With implementing Sharia law offenders can be punished by death. However an ancient tradition involving male homosexual acts between children and older men (typically wealthy warlords or elite people) called bacha bazi persists.\nReligious minorities such as Sikhs, Hindus, and Christians have reportedly faced persecution in the country.\nSince May 2022, all women in Afghanistan have been required by law to wear full-body coverings when in public (either a burqa or an abaya paired with a niqāb, which leaves only the eyes uncovered). In a May interview with Christiane Amanpour, First Deputy Leader Sirajuddin Haqqani claimed the decree is only advisory and no form of hijab is compulsory in Afghanistan, though this contradicts the reality. It has been speculated that there is a genuine internal policy division over women's rights between hardliners, including Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, and pragmatists, though they publicly present a united front. Another decree was issued shortly after the first, requiring female TV presenters to cover their faces during broadcasts.\nIn May 2022, the Taliban dissolved Afghanistan's Human Rights Commission along with four other government departments, citing the country's budget deficit.\n## Economy\nAfghanistan's nominal GDP was $21.7 billion in 2018, or $72.9 billion by purchasing power parity (PPP). Its GDP per capita is $2,024 (PPP). Despite having $1 trillion or more in mineral deposits, it remains one of the world's least developed countries. Afghanistan's rough physical geography and its landlocked status has been cited as reasons why the country has always been among the least developed in the modern era – a factor where progress is also slowed by contemporary conflict and political instability. The country imports over $7 billion worth of goods but exports only $784 million, mainly fruits and nuts. It has $2.8 billion in external debt. The service sector contributed the most to the GDP (55.9%) followed by agriculture (23%) and industry (21.1%).\nWhile the nation's current account deficit is largely financed with donor money, only a small portion is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations.\nDa Afghanistan Bank serves as the central bank of the nation and the Afghani (AFN) is the national currency, with an exchange rate of about 75 Afghanis to 1 US dollar. A number of local and foreign banks operate in the country, including the Afghanistan International Bank, New Kabul Bank, Azizi Bank, Pashtany Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, and the First Micro Finance Bank.\nOne of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over 5 million expatriates, who brought with them entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to start up businesses. Many Afghans are now involved in construction, which is one of the largest industries in the country. Some of the major national construction projects include the $35 billion New Kabul City next to the capital, the Aino Mena project in Kandahar, and the Ghazi Amanullah Khan Town near Jalalabad. Similar development projects have also begun in Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, and other cities. An estimated 400,000 people enter the labor market each year.\nSeveral small companies and factories began operating in different parts of the country, which not only provide revenues to the government but also create new jobs. Improvements to the business environment have resulted in more than $1.5 billion in telecom investment and created more than 100,000 jobs since 2003. Afghan rugs are becoming popular again, allowing many carpet dealers around the country to hire more workers; in 2016–17 it was the fourth most exported group of items.\nAfghanistan is a member of WTO, SAARC, ECO, and OIC. It holds an observer status in SCO. In 2018, a majority of imports come from either Iran, China, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, while 84% of exports are to Pakistan and India.\nSince the Taliban's takeover of the country in August 2021, the United States has frozen about $9 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank, blocking the Taliban from accessing billions of dollars held in U.S. bank accounts.\n### Agriculture\nAgricultural production is the backbone of Afghanistan's economy and has traditionally dominated the economy, employing about 40% of the workforce as of 2018. The country is known for producing pomegranates, grapes, apricots, melons, and several other fresh and dry fruits. It is also known as the world's largest producer of opium – as much as 16% or more of the nation's economy is derived from the cultivation and sale of opium. It is also one of the world's top producers of cannabis.\nSaffron, the most expensive spice, grows in Afghanistan, particularly Herat Province. In recent years, there has been an uptick in saffron production, which authorities and farmers trying to replace poppy cultivation. Between 2012 and 2019, the saffron cultivated and produced in Afghanistan was consecutively ranked the world's best by the International Taste and Quality Institute. Production hit record high in 2019 (19,469 kg of saffron), and one kilogram is sold domestically between $634 and $1147.\nThe availability of cheap diesel-powered water pumps imported from China and Pakistan, and in the 2010s, of cheap solar power to pump water, resulted in expansion of agriculture and population in the southwestern deserts of Afghanistan in Kandahar Province, Helmand Province and Nimruz Province in the 2010s. Wells have gradually been deepened, but water resources are limited. Opium is the major crop, but as of 2022, was under attack by the new Taliban government which, in order to suppress opium production, was systematically suppressing water pumping.\n### Mining\nThe country's natural resources include: coal, copper, iron ore, lithium, uranium, rare earth elements, chromite, gold, zinc, talc, barite, sulfur, lead, marble, precious and semi-precious stones, natural gas, and petroleum. In 2010, US and Afghan government officials estimated that untapped mineral deposits located in 2007 by the US Geological Survey are worth at least $1 trillion.\nMichael E. O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution estimated that if Afghanistan generates about $10 billion per year from its mineral deposits, its gross national product would double and provide long-term funding for Afghan security forces and other critical needs. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimated in 2006 that northern Afghanistan has an average 460 million m3 (2.9 billion bbl) of crude oil, 440 billion m3 (15.7 trillion cu ft) of natural gas, and 67 billion L (562 million US bbl) of natural gas liquids. In 2011, Afghanistan signed an oil exploration contract with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) for the development of three oil fields along the Amu Darya river in the north.\nThe country has significant amounts of lithium, copper, gold, coal, iron ore, and other minerals. The Khanashin carbonatite in Helmand Province contains 1,000,000 tonnes (980,000 long tons; 1,100,000 short tons) of rare earth elements. In 2007, a 30-year lease was granted for the Aynak copper mine to the China Metallurgical Group for $3 billion, making it the biggest foreign investment and private business venture in Afghanistan's history. The state-run Steel Authority of India won the mining rights to develop the huge Hajigak iron ore deposit in central Afghanistan. Government officials estimate that 30% of the country's untapped mineral deposits are worth at least $1 trillion. One official asserted that \"this will become the backbone of the Afghan economy\" and a Pentagon memo stated that Afghanistan could become the \"Saudi Arabia of lithium\". The lithium reserves of 21 Mio. tons could amount to the ones of Bolivia, which is currently viewed as the country with the largest lithium reserves. Other larger deposits are the ones of Bauxit and Cobalt. In a 2011 news story, the CSM reported, \"The United States and other Western nations that have borne the brunt of the cost of the Afghan war have been conspicuously absent from the bidding process on Afghanistan's mineral deposits, leaving it mostly to regional powers.\"\nAccess to biocapacity in Afghanistan is lower than world average. In 2016, Afghanistan had 0.43 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory, much less than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person. In 2016 Afghanistan used 0.73 global hectares of biocapacity per person - their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use just under double as much biocapacity as Afghanistan contains. As a result, Afghanistan is running a biocapacity deficit.\n## Infrastructure\n### Energy\nAccording to the World Bank, 98% of the rural population have access to electricity in 2018, up from 28% in 2008. Overall the figure stands at 98.7%. As of 2016, Afghanistan produces 1,400 megawatts of power, but still imports the majority of electricity via transmission lines from Iran and the Central Asian states. The majority of electricity production is via hydropower, helped by the amount of rivers and streams that flow from the mountains. However electricity is not always reliable and blackouts happen, including in Kabul. In recent years an increasing number of solar, biomass and wind power plants have been constructed. Currently under development are the CASA-1000 project which will transmit electricity from Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline. Power is managed by the Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS, Afghanistan Electricity Company).\nImportant dams include the Kajaki Dam, Dahla Dam, and the Sardeh Band Dam.\n### Tourism\nTourism is a small industry in Afghanistan due to security issues. Nevertheless, some 20,000 foreign tourists visit the country annually as of 2016. In particular an important region for domestic and international tourism is the picturesque Bamyan Valley, which includes lakes, canyons and historical sites, helped by the fact it is in a safe area away from insurgent activity. Smaller numbers visit and trek in regions such as the Wakhan Valley, which is also one of the world's most remote communities. From the late 1960s onwards, Afghanistan was a popular stop on the famous hippie trail, attracting many Europeans and Americans. Coming from Iran, the trail traveled through various Afghan provinces and cities including Herat, Kandahar and Kabul before crossing to northern Pakistan, northern India, and Nepal. Tourism peaked in 1977, the year before the start of political instability and armed conflict.\nThe city of Ghazni has significant history and historical sites, and together with Bamyan city have in recent years been voted Islamic Cultural Capital and South Asia Cultural Capital respectively. The cities of Herat, Kandahar, Balkh, and Zaranj are also very historic. The Minaret of Jam in the Hari River valley is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A cloak reputedly worn by Islam's prophet Muhammad is kept inside the Shrine of the Cloak in Kandahar, a city founded by Alexander the Great and the first capital of Afghanistan. The citadel of Alexander in the western city of Herat has been renovated in recent years and is a popular attraction. In the north of the country is the Shrine of Ali, believed by many to be the location where Ali was buried. The National Museum of Afghanistan is located in Kabul and hosts a large number of Buddhist, Bactrian Greek and early Islamic antiquities; the museum suffered greatly by civil war but has been slowly restoring since the early 2000s.\n### Communication\nTelecommunication services in Afghanistan are provided by Afghan Telecom, Afghan Wireless, Etisalat, MTN Group, and Roshan. The country uses its own space satellite called Afghansat 1, which provides services to millions of phone, internet, and television subscribers. By 2001 following years of civil war, telecommunications was virtually a non-existent sector, but by 2016 it had grown to a $2 billion industry, with 22 million mobile phone subscribers and 5 million internet users. The sector employs at least 120,000 people nationwide.\n### Transportation\nDue to Afghanistan's geography, transport between various parts of the country has historically been difficult. The backbone of Afghanistan's road network is Highway 1, often called the \"Ring Road\", which extends for 2,210 kilometers (1,370 mi) and connects five major cities: Kabul, Ghazni, Kandahar, Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif, with spurs to Kunduz and Jalalabad and various border crossings, while skirting around the mountains of the Hindu Kush.\nThe Ring Road is crucially important for domestic and international trade and the economy. A key portion of the Ring Road is the Salang Tunnel, completed in 1964, which facilitates travel through the Hindu Kush mountain range and connects northern and southern Afghanistan. It is the only land route that connects Central Asia to the Indian subcontinent. Several mountain passes allow travel between the Hindu Kush in other areas. Serious traffic accidents are common on Afghan roads and highways, particularly on the Kabul–Kandahar and the Kabul–Jalalabad Road. Traveling by bus in Afghanistan remains dangerous due to militant activities.\nAir transport in Afghanistan is provided by the national carrier, Ariana Afghan Airlines, and by the private company Kam Air. Airlines from a number of countries also provide flights in and out of the country. These include Air India, Emirates, Gulf Air, Iran Aseman Airlines, Pakistan International Airlines, and Turkish Airlines. The country has four international airports: Hamid Karzai International Airport (formerly Kabul International Airport), Kandahar International Airport, Herat International Airport, and Mazar-e Sharif International Airport. Including domestic airports, there are 43. Bagram Air Base is a major military airfield.\nThe country has three rail links: one, a 75-kilometer (47 mi) line from Mazar-i-Sharif to the Uzbekistan border; a 10-kilometer (6.2 mi) long line from Toraghundi to the Turkmenistan border (where it continues as part of Turkmen Railways); and a short link from Aqina across the Turkmen border to Kerki, which is planned to be extended further across Afghanistan. These lines are used for freight only and there is no passenger service. A rail line between Khaf, Iran and Herat, western Afghanistan, intended for both freight and passengers, is under construction as of 2019. About 125 kilometers (78 mi) of the line will lie on the Afghan side. There are various proposals for the construction of additional rail lines in the country.\nPrivate vehicle ownership has increased substantially since the early 2000s. Taxis are yellow in color and consist of both cars and auto rickshaws. In rural Afghanistan, villagers often use donkeys, mules or horses to transport or carry goods. Camels are primarily used by the Kochi nomads. Bicycles are popular throughout Afghanistan.\n## Culture\nAfghans have both common cultural features and those that differ between the regions of Afghanistan, each with distinctive cultures partly as a result of geographic obstacles that divide the country. Family is the mainstay of Afghan society and families are often headed by a patriarch. In the southern and eastern region, the people live according to the Pashtun culture by following Pashtunwali (the Pashtun way). Key tenets of Pashtunwali include hospitality, the provision of sanctuary to those seeking refuge, and revenge for the shedding of blood. The Pashtuns are largely connected to the culture of Central Asia and the Iranian Plateau. The remaining Afghans are culturally Persian and Turkic. Some non-Pashtuns who live in proximity with Pashtuns have adopted Pashtunwali in a process called Pashtunization, while some Pashtuns have been Persianized. Those who have lived in Pakistan and Iran over the last 30 years have been further influenced by the cultures of those neighboring nations. The Afghan people are known to be strongly religious.\nAfghans, particularly Pashtuns, are noted for their tribal solidarity and high regard for personal honor. One writer considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle. There are various Afghan tribes, and an estimated 2–3 million nomads. Afghan culture is deeply Islamic, but pre-Islamic practices persist. One example is bacha bazi, a term for activities involving sexual relations between older men and younger adolescent men, or boys. Child marriage is prevalent in Afghanistan; the legal age for marriage is 16. The most preferred marriage in Afghan society is to one's parallel cousin, and the groom is often expected to pay a bride price.\nIn the villages, families typically occupy mudbrick houses, or compounds with mudbrick or stone walled houses. Villages typically have a headman (malik), a master for water distribution (mirab) and a religious teacher (mullah). Men would typically work on the fields, joined by women during harvest. About 15% of the population are nomadic, locally called kochis. When nomads pass villages they often buy supplies such as tea, wheat and kerosene from the villagers; villagers buy wool and milk from the nomads.\nAfghan clothing for both men and women typically consists of various forms of shalwar kameez, especially perahan tunban and khet partug. Women would normally wear a chador for head covering; some women, typically from highly conservative communities, wear the burqa, a full body covering. These were worn by some women of the Pashtun community well before Islam came to the region, but the Taliban enforced this dress on women when they were in power. Another popular dress is the chapan which acts as a coat. The karakul is a hat made from the fur of a specific regional breed of sheep. It was favored by former kings of Afghanistan and became known to much of the world in the 21st century when it was constantly worn by President Hamid Karzai. The pakol is another traditional hat originating from the far east of the country; it was popularly worn by the guerrilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud. The Mazari hat originates from northern Afghanistan.\n### Architecture\nThe nation has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments. Afghanistan contains many remnants from all ages, including Greek and Buddhist stupas, monasteries, monuments, temples and Islamic minarets. Among the most well known are the Great Mosque of Herat, the Blue Mosque, the Minaret of Jam, the Chil Zena, the Qala-i Bost in Lashkargah, the ancient Greek city of Ai-Khanoum. However, many of its historic monuments have been damaged in modern times due to the civil wars. The two famous Buddhas of Bamiyan were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as idolatrous. Despite that, archaeologists are still finding Buddhist relics in different parts of the country, some of them dating back to the 2nd century. As there was no colonialism in the modern era in Afghanistan, European-style architecture is rare but does exist: the Victory Arch at Paghman and the Darul Aman Palace in Kabul were built in this style in the 1920s by the Afghans themselves.\n### Art and ceramics\nCarpet weaving is an ancient practice in Afghanistan, and many of these are still handmade by tribal and nomadic people today. Carpets have been produced in the region for thousands of years and traditionally done by women. Some crafters express their feelings through the designs of rugs; for example after the outbreak of the Soviet–Afghan War, \"war rugs\", a variant of Afghan rugs, were created with designs representing pain and misery caused by the conflict. Every province has its own specific characteristics in making rugs. In some of the Turkic-populated areas in the north-west, bride and wedding ceremony prices are driven by the bride's weaving skills.\nPottery has been crafted in Afghanistan for millennia. The village of Istalif, north of Kabul, is in particular a major center, known for its unique turquoise and green pottery, and their methods of crafting have remained the same for centuries. Much of lapis lazuli stones were earthed in modern-day Afghanistan which were used in Chinese porcelain as cobalt blue, later used in ancient Mesopotamia and Turkey.\nThe lands of Afghanistan have a long history of art, with the world's earliest known usage of oil painting found in cave murals in the country. A notable art style that developed in Afghanistan and eastern Pakistan is Gandhara Art, produced by a fusion of Greco-Roman art and Buddhist art between the 1st and 7th centuries CE. Later eras saw increased use of the Persian miniature style, with Kamaleddin Behzad of Herat being one of the most notable miniature artists of the Timurid and early Safavid periods. Since the 1900s, the nation began to use Western techniques in art. Abdul Ghafoor Breshna was a prominent Afghan painter and sketch artist from Kabul during the 20th century.\n### Media and entertainment\nAfghanistan has around 350 radio stations and over 200 television stations. Radio Television Afghanistan, originating from 1925, is the state public broadcaster. Television programs began airing in the 1970s and today there are many private television channels such as TOLO and Shamshad TV. The first Afghan newspaper was published in 1873, and there are hundreds of print outlets today. By the 1920s, Radio Kabul was broadcasting local radio services. Voice of America, BBC, and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) broadcast in both of Afghanistan's official languages on radio. Press restrictions have been gradually relaxed and private media diversified since 2002, after more than two decades of tight controls.\nAfghans have long been accustomed to watching Indian Bollywood films and listening to its filmi songs. It has been claimed that Afghanistan is among the biggest markets for the Hindi film industry. The stereotypes of Afghans in India (Kabuliwala or Pathani) have also been represented in some Bollywood films by actors. Many Bollywood film stars have roots in Afghanistan, including Salman Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Aamir Khan, Feroz Khan, Kader Khan, Naseeruddin Shah, Zarine Khan, Celina Jaitly, and a number of others. Several Bollywood films have been shot inside Afghanistan, including Dharmatma, Khuda Gawah, Escape from Taliban, and Kabul Express.\n### Music\nAfghan classical music has close historical links with Indian classical music and use the same Hindustani terminology and theories like raga. Genres of this style of music include ghazal (poetic music) and instruments such as the Indian tabla, sitar and harmonium, and local instruments like zerbaghali, as well as dayereh and tanbur which are also known in Central Asia, the Caucusus and the Middle East. The rubab is the country's national instrument and precurses the Indian sarod instrument. Some of the famous artists of classical music include Ustad Sarahang and Sarban.\nPop music developed in the 1950s through Radio Kabul and was influential in social change. During this time female artists also started appearing, at first Mermon Parwin. Perhaps the most famous artist of this genre was Ahmad Zahir, who synthesized many genres and continues to be renowned for his voice and rich lyrics long after his death in 1979. Other notable masters of traditional or popular Afghan music include Nashenas, Ubaidullah Jan, Mahwash, Ahmad Wali, Farhad Darya, and Naghma.\nAttan is the national dance of Afghanistan, a group dance popularly performed by Afghans of all backgrounds. The dance is considered part of Afghan identity.\n### Cuisine\nAfghan cuisine is largely based upon the nation's chief crops, such as wheat, maize, barley and rice. Accompanying these staples are native fruits and vegetables as well as dairy products such as milk, yogurt and whey. Kabuli palaw is the national dish of Afghanistan. The nation's culinary specialties reflect its ethnic and geographic diversity. Afghanistan is known for its high quality pomegranates, grapes, and sweet melons. Tea is a favorite drink among Afghans, and a typical diet consists of naan, yoghurts, rice and meat.\n### Literature\nClassic Persian and Pashto poetry are a cherished part of Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in the region, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. One of the poetic styles is called landay. A popular theme in Afghan folklore and mythology are Divs, monstrous creatures. Thursdays are traditionally \"poetry night\" in the city of Herat when men, women and children gather and recite both ancient and modern poems.\nThe Afghan region has produced countless Persian-speaking poets and writers from the Middle Ages to the present day, among which three mystical authors are considered true national glories (although claimed with equal ardor by Iran), namely: Khwaja Abdullah Ansari of Herat, a great mystic and Sufi saint in the 11th century, Sanai of Ghazni, author of mystical poems in the 12th century, and, finally, Rumi of Balkh, in the 13th century, considered the persophonist throughout the world as the greatest mystical poet of the entire Muslim world. The Afghan Pashto literature, although quantitatively remarkable and in great growth in the last century, has always had an essentially local meaning and importance, feeling the influence of both Persian literature and the contiguous literatures of India. Both main literatures, from the second half of the nineteenth century, have shown themselves to be sensitive to genres (novel, theater), movements and stylistic features imported from Europe.\nKhushal Khan Khattak of the 17th century is considered the national poet. Other notable poets include Rabi'a Balkhi, Jami, Rahman Baba, Khalilullah Khalili, and Parween Pazhwak.\n### Holidays and festivals\nAfghanistan's official New Year starts with Nowruz, an ancient tradition that started as a Zoroastrian celebration in present-day Iran, and with which it shares the annual celebration along with several other countries. It occurs every year at the vernal equinox. In Afghanistan, Nowruz is typically celebrated with music and dance, as well as holding buzkashi tournaments.\nYaldā, another nationally celebrated ancient tradition, commemorates the ancient goddess Mithra and marks the longest night of the year on the eve of the winter solstice (čelle ye zemestān; usually falling on 20 or 21 December), during which families gather together to recite poetry and eat fruits—particularly the red fruits watermelon and pomegranate, as well as mixed nuts.\nReligious festivals are also celebrated; as a predominantly Muslim country, Islamic events and festivals such as Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr and Ashura are widely celebrated annually in Afghanistan. The Sikh festival of Vaisakhi is celebrated by the Sikh community and the Hindu festival Diwali by the Hindu community.\nNational Independence Day is celebrated on 19 August to mark the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 under King Amanullah Khan and the country's full independence. Several international celebrations are also officially held in Afghanistan, such as International Workers' Day and International Women's Day. Some regional festivals include the Pamir Festival, which celebrates the culture of the Wakhi and Kyrgyz peoples, the Red Flower Festival (during Nowruz) in Mazar-i-Sharif and the Damboora Festival in Bamyan Province.\n### Sports\nSport in Afghanistan is managed by the Afghan Sports Federation. Cricket and Association football are the two most popular sports in the country. The Afghan Sports Federation promotes cricket, association football, basketball, volleyball, golf, handball, boxing, taekwondo, weightlifting, bodybuilding, track and field, skating, bowling, snooker, chess, and other sports.\nAfghanistan's sports teams are increasingly celebrating titles at international events. basketball team won the first team sports title at the 2010 South Asian Games. Later that year, the country's cricket team followed it with the winning of 2009–10 ICC Intercontinental Cup. In 2012, the country's 3x3 basketball team won the gold medal at the 2012 Asian Beach Games. In 2013, Afghanistan's football team followed as it won the SAFF Championship.\nThe Afghan national cricket team, which was formed in 2001, participated in the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier, 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division One and the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. It won the ACC Twenty20 Cup in 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013. The team eventually made it and played in the 2015 Cricket World Cup. The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) is the official governing body of the sport and is headquartered in Kabul. The Alokozay Kabul International Cricket Ground serves as the nation's main cricket stadium. There are several other stadiums throughout the country, including the Ghazi Amanullah Khan International Cricket Stadium near Jalalabad. Domestically, cricket is played between teams from different provinces.\nThe Afghanistan national football team has been competing in international football since 1941. The national team plays its home games at the Ghazi Stadium in Kabul, while football in Afghanistan is governed by the Afghanistan Football Federation. The national team has never competed or qualified for the FIFA World Cup but has recently won an international football trophy in 2013. The country also has a national team in the sport of futsal, a 5-a-side variation of football.\nThe traditional and the national sport of Afghanistan is buzkashi, mainly popular in the north, but also having a following in other parts of the country. It is similar to polo, played by horsemen in two teams, each trying to grab and hold a goat carcass. The Afghan Hound (a type of running dog) originated in Afghanistan and was formerly used in wolf hunting. In 2002, traveler Rory Stewart reported that dogs were still used for wolf hunting in remote areas."], "selected_questions": ["What are the three distinct geographic regions of Afghanistan?", "Which region of Afghanistan is known for its fertile soils and rich mineral resources?", "What is the literacy rate in Afghanistan?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The three distinct geographic regions of Afghanistan are the central highlands, the northern plains, and the southwestern plateau.", "The northern plains region of Afghanistan is known for its fertile soils and rich mineral resources.", "According to the 2018 data, the literacy rate in Afghanistan is 43.02%."], "InternLM_answers": ["Afghanistan is divided into three distinct geographic regions: the Hindu Kush Mountains, the Central Highlands, and the deserts and plains of the south and west.", "The region of Afghanistan known for its fertile soils and rich mineral resources is the region of Bamyan.

{"name": "United Arab Republic", "documents": ["# United Arab Republic\nCoordinates: 30°02′N 31°13′E﻿ / ﻿30.033°N 31.217°E﻿ / 30.033; 31.217\nThe United Arab Republic (UAR; Arabic: الجمهورية العربية المتحدة, romanized: al-Jumhūrīyah al-'Arabīyah al-Muttaḥidah) was a sovereign state in the Middle East from 1958 until 1971. It was initially a political union between Egypt (including the occupied Gaza Strip) and Syria from 1958 until Syria seceded from the union after the 1961 Syrian coup d'état. Egypt continued to be known officially as the United Arab Republic until 1971.\nThe republic was led by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. The UAR was a member of the United Arab States, a loose confederation with the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen, which was dissolved in 1961.\n## History\n### Origins\nThe United Arab Republic was established on 1 February 1958 as the first step towards a larger pan-Arab state, originally being proposed to Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser by a group of political and military leaders in Syria.\nPan-Arab sentiment traditionally was very strong in Syria, and Nasser was a popular heroic figure throughout the Arab world following the Suez Crisis of 1956. There was thus considerable popular support in Syria for union with Nasser's Egypt. The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party was the leading advocate of such a union.\nIn mid-1957, Western powers began to worry that Syria was close to a Communist takeover; it had a highly organized Communist Party and the newly appointed army's chief of staff, Afif al-Bizri, was a Communist sympathizer. This caused the Syrian Crisis of 1957 after which Syrians intensified their efforts to unite with Egypt. Nasser told a Syrian delegation, including President Shukri al-Quwatli and Prime Minister Khaled al-Azem, that they needed to rid their government of Communists, but the delegation countered and warned him that only total union with Egypt would end the \"Communist threat\". According to Abdel Latif Boghdadi, Nasser initially resisted a total union with Syria, favoring instead a federal union. However, Nasser was \"more afraid of a Communist takeover\" and agreed on a total merger. The increasing strength of the Syrian Communist Party, under the leadership of Khalid Bakdash, worried the Syrian Ba'ath Party, which was suffering from an internal crisis from which prominent members were anxious to find an escape. Syria had a democratic government since the overthrow of Adib al-Shishakli's military regime in 1954, and popular pressure for Arab unity was reflected in the composition of parliament.\nWhen on 11 January 1958 al-Bizri led a Syrian delegation composed of military officers to Cairo, and personally encouraged Syrian-Egyptian unity, Nasser opted for a quick merger. Only Syrian advocates of unity, including Salah al-Din Bitar and Akram El-Hourani had prior knowledge of this delegation; Quwatli and Azem were notified a day later and considered it tantamount to a \"military coup\".\nNasser's final terms for the union were decisive and non-negotiable: \"a plebiscite, the dissolution of parties, and the withdrawal of the army from politics\". While the plebiscite seemed reasonable to most Syrian elites, the latter two conditions were extremely worrisome. They believed it would destroy political life in Syria. Despite these concerns, the Syrian officials knew it was too late to turn back. The members of the elite in Syria viewed the merger with Egypt as the lesser of two evils. They believed that Nasser's terms were unfair, but given the intense pressure that their government was undergoing, they believed that they had no other choice.\nA plebiscite was held on February 21, 1958, with Egyptians and Syrians voting in favor of the merger. The result were announced on February 22 and Nasser was declared the new president of the United Arab Republic.\nEgyptian and Syrian leaders signed the protocols, although Azem did so reluctantly. Nasser became the republic's president and very soon carried out a crackdown against the Syrian Communists and opponents of the union which included dismissing Bizri and Azem from their posts.\n### Early history\nAdvocates of the union believed that Nasser would use the Ba'ath Party for ruling Syria. Unfortunately for the Ba'athists, it was never Nasser's intention to share an equal measure of power. Nasser established a new provisional constitution proclaiming a 600-member National Assembly with 400 members from Egypt and 200 from Syria, and the disbanding of all political parties, including the Ba'ath. Nasser gave each of the provinces two vice-presidents, assigning Boghdadi and Abdel Hakim Amer to Egypt and Sabri al-Assali and Akram El-Hourani – a leader of the Ba'ath – to Syria. The new provisional constitution of 1958 was adopted.\nThough Nasser allowed former Ba'ath Party members to hold prominent political positions, they never reached positions as high in the government as did the Egyptian officials. During the winter and the spring of 1959–60, Nasser slowly squeezed prominent Syrians out of positions of influence. In the Syrian Ministry of Industry, for example, seven of the top thirteen positions were filled by Egyptians. In the General Petroleum Authority, four of the top six officials were Egyptian. In the fall of 1958, Nasser formed a tripartite committee, consisting of Zakaria Mohieddine, al-Hawrani, and Bitar to oversee the affairs in Syria. By moving the latter two, both Ba'athists, to Cairo, he neutralized important political figures who had their own ideas about how Syria should be run within the UAR.\nIn Syria, opposition to union with Egypt mounted. Syrian Army officers resented being subordinate to Egyptian officers, and Syrian Bedouin tribes received money from Saudi Arabia to prevent them from becoming loyal to Nasser. Also, Egyptian-style land reform was resented for damaging Syrian agriculture, the Communists began to gain influence, and the intellectuals of the Ba'ath Party who supported the union rejected the one-party system. Mustafa al-Barudi, the Syrian Minister of Propaganda, stated that 'the smallest member of the (Egyptian) retinue thought that he had inherited our country.  spread \"like octopuses\" everywhere.' Nasser was not able to address problems in Syria completely, because they were new to him, and instead of appointing Syrians to run Syria, he assigned this position to Amer and Abdel Hamid Sarraj (a Syrian army official and Nasser sympathizer).\nIn Egypt, the situation was more positive, with a GNP growth of 4.5 per cent and a rapid growth of industry. In 1960, Nasser nationalized the Egyptian press, reducing it to his personal mouthpiece.\n### Foreign relations\nThe union was interpreted by the other nations of the world as a major threat to Jordan. Syria was seen as a source of instigation and shelter for Jordanian plotters against King Hussein. Egypt's own status as a state hostile to Western involvement in the region (and thus to the close relationship between the British, in particular, and the Jordanian and Iraqi monarchies) added to the pressure. Hussein responded by proposing to Faisal II of Iraq a Jordanian-Iraqi union to counter the UAR; such a union formed on 14 February 1958 as the Arab Federation. Jordan and Iraq agreed to establish a unified military command with a unified military budget, 80 per cent of which was to be provided by Iraq and the remaining 20 per cent by Jordan. Troops from both countries were exchanged in the arrangement.\nIn nearby Lebanon, President Camille Chamoun, an opponent of Nasser, viewed the creation of the UAR with worry. Pro-Nasser factions in the country, mostly comprising Muslims and Druze, began clashing with the Maronite population who generally supported Chamoun, culminating in a civil war by May 1958. The former favoured merging with the UAR, while the latter feared the new country as a satellite of Communism. Although Nasser did not covet Lebanon, seeing it as a special case, he felt obliged to back his supporters through giving Abdel Hamid Sarraj the task of sending them money, light arms, and training officers.\nOn 14 July 1958, Iraqi army officers staged a military coup and overthrew the Kingdom of Iraq – which had just previously united with Jordan to form the rival Arab Federation. Nasser declared his recognition of the new government and stated that \"any attack on Iraq was tantamount to an attack on the UAR\". The next day US Marines and British special forces landed in Lebanon and in Jordan, respectively, to protect the two countries from falling to pro-Nasser forces. To Nasser, the revolution in Iraq opened the road for Arab nationalism. Although most members of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) favoured joining Iraq with the UAR, the new prime minister Abdel Karim Qasim disagreed. Said K. Aburish states reasons for this could have included Nasser's refusal to cooperate with and encourage the Iraqi Free Officers a year before the coup – or Qasim viewed Nasser as a threat to his supremacy as leader of Iraq.\nLater in July, the US government convinced Chamoun not to seek a second term. This allowed the election of Fuad Chehab as Lebanon's new president. Nasser and Chehab met at the Lebanese–Syrian border and Nasser explained to Chehab that he never wanted unity with Lebanon, but only that the country not be used as a base against the UAR. This meeting resulted in the end of the crisis in Lebanon, with Nasser ceasing to supply his partisans and the US setting a deadline for withdrawing from the area.\nAfter the overthrow of its Hashemite monarchy in 1958, Iraq became the Arab state most supportive of the UAR. Iraq sought to join the union; however, in 1959 Qasim cancelled the unity talks. After Qasim's overthrow in 1963 the union idea resurrected with the proposal of Egypt, Iraq, and Syria reforming the UAR. A new flag was proposed, with three stars symbolizing the three states constituting the proposed union. However, the plan for a tri-partite union never materialised. Iraq continued to use the three-star flag and later adopted it as the national flag. This three-star flag remained Iraq's national flag (with some modifications) until 2007.\n### Flag\nThe UAR adopted a flag based on the Arab Liberation Flag of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, but with two stars to represent the two parts of the UAR. From 1980 this has been the official flag of Syria. In 1963, Iraq adopted a flag that was similar but with three stars, representing the hope that Iraq would join the UAR. The current flags of Egypt, Sudan and Yemen are also based on the Arab Liberation Flag of horizontal red, white and black bands.\n### Nationalization\nIn June 1960, Nasser tried to establish economic reforms that would bring the Syrian economy more in line with the strong Egyptian public sector. However, these changes did little to help either economy. Rather than shift growth toward the private sector, Nasser embarked on an unprecedented wave of nationalizations in both Syria and Egypt. These began in July 1961, without consulting top Syrian economic officials. The entire cotton trade was taken over by the government, as well as all import-export firms. Nasser announced the nationalization of banks, insurance companies, and all heavy industry, July 23, 1961. Nasser also extended his social justice principles. The land limit was reduced from 200 to 100 feddans. Interest rates for farmers were dramatically reduced to the point of elimination in some cases. A ninety percent tax was instituted on all income above £E10,000. Workers and employees were allowed representatives on management boards. They were also given the right to a twenty-five percent share in the profit of their firm. The average workday was also cut from eight hours to seven without a reduction in pay.\n### Collapse\nInstead of a federation of two Arab peoples, as many Syrians had imagined, the UAR turned into a state completely dominated by Egyptians. Syrian political life was also diminished, as Nasser demanded all political parties in Syria to be dismantled. In the process, the strongly centralized Egyptian state imposed Nasser's socialistic political and economic system on weaker Syria, creating a backlash from the Syrian business and army circles, which resulted in the Syrian coup of September 28, 1961, and the end of the UAR. According to Elie Podeh, \"... this unity scheme was successful in consolidating the shaky Syrian identity. In fact, once the Syrians lost their independence they suddenly realized that they did indeed possess a different identity than the Egyptians.\"\nDespite the economic difficulties, what truly produced the demise of the UAR was Nasser's inability to find a suitable political system for the new regime. Given his socialist agenda in Egypt, the Ba'ath should have been his natural ally, but Nasser was hesitant to share power. Though Amer allowed some liberalization of the economy in order to appease Syrian businessmen, his decision to rig the elections of the National Union (the single party which replaced the Ba'ath), with the help of Colonel Abdul Hamid Sarraj (a Syrian army official and Nasser sympathizer), antagonized Ba'athist leaders. The Ba'ath Party won only five percent of the seats on the higher committees, while the more traditional conservative parties won a significant majority. Sarraj was appointed the head of the National Union in Syria, and by the spring of 1960 had replaced Amer as the chair of the Syrian Executive Council. Under Sarraj Syria was ruled by a repressive security force designed to suppress all opposition to the regime.\nThe immense increases in public sector control were accompanied by a push for centralization. In August 1961 Nasser abolished regional governments in favour of one central authority, which operated from Damascus February through May and from Cairo for the rest of the year. As a part of this centralization, Sarraj was relocated to Cairo, where he found himself with little real power. September 15, 1961, Sarraj returned to Syria, and after meeting with Nasser and Amer resigned from all his posts on September 26.\nWithout any close allies to watch over Syria, Nasser was unaware of the growing unrest of the military. On September 28 a group of officers staged a coup and declared Syria's independence from the UAR. Though the coup leaders were willing to renegotiate a union under terms they felt would put Syria on an equal footing with Egypt, Nasser refused such a compromise. He initially considered sending troops to overthrow the new regime, but chose not to once he was informed that the last of his allies in Syria had been defeated. In speeches that followed the coup, Nasser declared he would never give up his goal of an ultimate Arab union. However, he would never again achieve such a tangible victory toward this goal.\n### After Syria's withdrawal\nAfter Syria's withdrawal from the union in 1961, Egypt retained its \"United Arab Republic\" name until 1971.\nFrom 5 to 10 June in 1967, Israel seized control of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula during the Six-Day War. Eventually, the Sinai Peninsula was returned to Egypt in 1978. The withdrawal of Israel from the Gaza Strip in 2005 was not followed by resumption of control by Egypt. Since 2007, the Gaza Strip has been controlled by the Islamist militant group Hamas.\n## Geography\nIf it existed today, the United Arab Republic would be the 25th largest nation on the planet (Egypt is 30th and Syria is 88th). It was comparable in size to South Africa, and twice the size of France. Following the dissolution of the All-Palestine Government, the United Arab Republic further exerted control over the Gaza Strip, until the Six-Day War.", "United Arab Republic (U.A.R.), Arabic Al-Jumhūriyyah al-ʿArabiyyah al-Muttaḥidah, political union of Egypt and Syria proclaimed on February 1, 1958, and ratified in nationwide plebiscites later that month. It ended on September 28, 1961, when Syria, following a military coup, declared itself independent of Egypt.\nYears of political turmoil in Syria, topped with increased interest in its affairs from the Cold War powers, pushed the country’s Pan-Arabist Baʿth Party to seek political union with Egyptian Pres. Gamal Abdel Nasser. Nasser, unprepared to tackle Syria’s domestic issues, was initially reluctant toward union but was eventually persuaded. His conditions for union, however, included measures that would bring Syria in line with the administrative structure of Egypt. While this enabled a more full integration, it effectively marginalized Syrian voices in the new regime even as Nasser implemented unpopular economic policies in Syria. Disaffected and ignored, members of the government from Syria’s Baʿth Party resigned their posts in December 1959.\nThe situation failed to improve thereafter and Syrians remained dissatisfied with the union. After a set of decrees in July 1961 exacerbated the agitation by limiting landholdings and nationalizing financial institutions and private enterprises, Syrian units of the military staged a coup on September 28 and seceded without contest. Despite the dissolution of the union with Syria, Egypt retained the name United Arab Republic until September 2, 1971, after Nasser’s death.\nFrom March 1958 until December 1961, the United Arab Republic maintained a confederation with the Zaydi imam Aḥmad ibn Yaḥyā who ruled in northern Yemen.

{"name": "Galilee", "documents": ["# Galilee\nGalilee (/ˈɡælɪliː/; Hebrew: הַגָּלִיל, romanized: hagGālīl; Arabic: الجليل, romanized: al-jalīl) is a region located in northern Israel and southern Lebanon. Galilee traditionally refers to the mountainous part, divided into Upper Galilee (הגליל העליון, ha-galil ha-elyon; الجليل الأعلى, al-jalīl al-aʾlā) and Lower Galilee (גליל תחתון, galil tahton; الجليل الأسفل, al-jalīl al-asfal).\nGalilee refers to all of the area that is north of the Mount Carmel-Mount Gilboa ridge and south of the east–west section of the Litani River. It extends from the Israeli coastal plain and the shores of the Mediterranean Sea with Acre in the west, to the Jordan Rift Valley to the east; and from the Litani in the north plus a piece bordering on the Golan Heights all the way to Dan at the base of Mount Hermon in the northeast, to Mount Carmel and Mount Gilboa in the south. This definition includes the plains of the Jezreel Valley north of Jenin and the Beth Shean Valley, the valley containing the Sea of Galilee, and the Hula Valley, although it usually does not include Haifa's immediate northern suburbs. By this definition it overlaps with much of the administrative Northern District of Israel and with Southern Lebanon.\n## Etymology\nThe region's Hebrew name is גָּלִיל (galíl), meaning 'district' or 'circle'. The Hebrew form used in Isaiah 9:1 (or 8:23 in different Biblical versions) is in the construct state, leading to g'lil ha-goyím (Hebrew: גְּלִיל הַגּוֹיִם), meaning 'Galilee of the nations', which refers to gentiles who settled there at the time that the book was written, either by their own volition or as a result of being deported there.\n## Borders and geography\nThe borders of Galilee, split into Upper Galilee and Lower Galilee, were described by Josephus in his The Jewish War:\nNow Phoenicia and Syria encompass about the Galilees, which are two, and called the Upper Galilee and the Lower. They are bounded toward the sun-setting, with the borders of the territory belonging to Ptolemais, and by Carmel; which mountain had formerly belonged to the Galileans, but now belonged to the Tyrians; to which mountain adjoins Gaba, which is called the City of Horsemen, because those horsemen that were dismissed by Herod the king dwelt therein; they are bounded on the south with Samaria and Scythopolis, as far as the river Jordan; on the east with Hippeae and Gadaris, and also with Ganlonitis, and the borders of the kingdom of Agrippa; its northern parts are hounded by Tyre, and the country of the Tyrians. As for that Galilee which is called the Lower, it, extends in length from Tiberias to Zabulon, and of the maritime places Ptolemais is its neighbor; its breadth is from the village called Xaloth, which lies in the great plain, as far as Bersabe, from which beginning also is taken the breadth of the Upper Galilee, as far as the village Baca, which divides the land of the Tyrians from it; its length is also from Meloth to Thella, a village near to Jordan.\nMost of Galilee consists of rocky terrain, at heights of between 500 and 700 m. Several high mountains are in the region, including Mount Tabor and Mount Meron, which have relatively low temperatures and high rainfall. As a result of this climate, flora and fauna thrive in the region, while many birds annually migrate from colder climates to Africa and back through the Hula–Jordan corridor. The streams and waterfalls, the latter mainly in Upper Galilee, along with vast fields of greenery and colourful wildflowers, as well as numerous towns of biblical importance, make the region a popular tourist destination.\nDue to its high rainfall 900 millimetres (35 in)–1,200 millimetres (47 in), mild temperatures and high mountains (Mount Meron's elevation is 1,000–1,208 m), the upper Galilee region contains some distinctive flora and fauna: prickly juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus), Lebanese cedar (Cedrus libani), which grows in a small grove on Mount Meron, cyclamens, paeonias, and Rhododendron ponticum which sometimes appears on Meron.\nWestern Galilee (Hebrew: גליל מערבי, romanized: Galil Ma'aravi) is a modern term referring to the western part of the Upper Galilee and its shore, and usually also the northwestern part of the Lower Galilee, mostly overlapping with Acre sub-district. Galilee Panhandle is a common term referring to the \"panhandle\" in the east that extends to the north, where Lebanon is to the west, and includes Hula Valley and Ramot Naftali mountains of the Upper Galilee.\n## History\n### Iron Age and Hebrew Bible\nAccording to the Bible, Galilee was named by the Israelites and was the tribal region of Naphthali and Dan, at times overlapping the Tribe of Asher's land. However, Dan was dispersed among the whole people rather than isolated to the lands of Dan, as the Tribe of Dan was the hereditary local law enforcement and judiciary for the whole nation. Normally, Galilee is just referred to as Naphthali.\nChapter 9 of 1 Kings states that Solomon rewarded his Phoenician ally, King Hiram I of Sidon, with twenty cities in the land of Galilee, which would then have been either settled by foreigners during and after the reign of Hiram, or by those who had been forcibly deported there by later conquerors such as the Assyrians. Hiram, to reciprocate previous gifts given to David, accepted the upland plain among the Naftali Mountains and renamed it \"the land of Cabul\" for a time.\n### Classical antiquity\nDuring the expansion under the Hasmonean dynasty, much of the Galilee region was conquered and annexed by the first Hasmonean king of Judaea Aristobulus I (104–103 BCE). Galilee in the first century was dotted with small towns and villages. The Jewish historian Josephus claims that there were 204 small towns in Galilee, but modern scholars believe this estimate to be an exaggeration. Many of these towns were located around the Sea of Galilee, which contained many edible fish and which was surrounded by fertile land. Salted, dried, and pickled fish were an important export good. In 4 BCE, a rebel named Judah plundered Galilee's largest city, Sepphoris. According to Josephus, the Syrian governor Publius Quinctilius Varus responded by sacking Sepphoris and selling the population into slavery, but the region's archaeology lacks evidence of such destruction.\nAfter the death of Herod the Great that same year, the Roman emperor Augustus appointed his son Herod Antipas as tetrarch of Galilee, which remained a Roman client state. Antipas paid tribute to the Roman Empire in exchange for Roman protection. The Romans did not station troops in Galilee, but threatened to retaliate against anyone who attacked it. As long as he continued to pay tribute, Antipas was permitted to govern however he wished and was permitted to mint his own coinage. Antipas was relatively observant of Jewish laws and customs. Although his palace was decorated with animal carvings, which many Jews regarded as a transgression against the law prohibiting idols, his coins bore only agricultural designs, which his subjects deemed acceptable. In general, Antipas was a capable ruler; Josephus does not record any instance of his use of force to put down an uprising and he had a long, prosperous reign. However, many Jews probably resented him as not sufficiently devout. Antipas rebuilt the city of Sepphoris and, in either 18 CE or 19 CE, he founded the new city of Tiberias. These two cities became Galilee's largest cultural centers. They were the main centers of Greco-Roman influence, but were still predominantly Jewish. A massive gap existed between the rich and poor, but lack of uprisings suggest that taxes were not exorbitantly high and that most Galileans did not feel their livelihoods were being threatened. Late in his reign, Antipas married his half-niece Herodias, who was already married to one of her other uncles. His wife, whom he divorced, fled to her father Aretas, an Arab king, who invaded Galilee and defeated Antipas's troops before withdrawing. Both Josephus and the Gospel of Mark record that the itinerate preacher John the Baptist criticized Antipas over his marriage and Antipas consequently had him imprisoned and then beheaded. In around 39 CE, at the urging of Herodias, Antipas went to Rome to request that he be elevated from the status of tetrarch to the status of king. The Romans found him guilty of storing arms, so he was removed from power and exiled, ending his forty-three-year reign. During the Great Revolt (66–73 CE), a Jewish mob destroyed Herod Antipas's palace.\nThe archaeological discoveries of synagogues from the Hellenistic and Roman period in the Galilee show strong Phoenician influences, and a high level of tolerance for other cultures relative to other Jewish religious centers.\nAccording to medieval Hebrew legend, Simeon bar Yochai, one of the most famed of all the Tannaim, wrote the Zohar while living in Galilee. Eastern Galilee retained a Jewish majority until at least the seventh century.\n### Early Muslim and Crusader periods\nAfter the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 630s, the Galilee formed part of Jund al-Urdunn (the military district of Jordan), itself part of Bilad al-Sham (Islamic Syria). Its major towns were Tiberias the capital of the district, Qadas, Beisan, Acre, Saffuriya, and Kabul. The geographer al-Ya'qubi (d. 891), who referred to the region 'Jabal al-Jalil', noted that its inhabitants were Arabs from the Amila tribe.\nThe Shia Fatimids conquered the region in the 10th century; a breakaway sect, venerating the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim, formed the Druze religion, centered in Mount Lebanon and partially in the Galilee. During the Crusades, Galilee was organized into the Principality of Galilee, one of the most important Crusader seigneuries.\n### Ottoman era\nDuring Early Ottoman era, the Galilee was governed as the Safad Sanjak, initially part of the larger administrative unit of Damascus Eyalet (1549–1660) and later as part of Sidon Eyalet (1660–1864). During the 18th century, the administrative division of Galilee was renamed to Acre Sanjak, and the Eyalet itself became centered in Acre, factually becoming the Acre Eyalet between 1775 and 1841.\nThe Jewish population of Galilee increased significantly following their expulsion from Spain and welcome from the Ottoman Empire. The community for a time made Safed an international center of cloth weaving and manufacturing, as well as a key site for Jewish learning. Today it remains one of Judaism's four holy cities and a center for kabbalah.\nIn the mid-17th century Galilee and Mount Lebanon became the scene of the Druze power struggle, which came in parallel with much destruction in the region and decline of major cities.\nIn the mid-18th century, Galilee was caught up in a struggle between the Arab leader Zahir al-Umar and the Ottoman authorities who were centred in Damascus. Zahir ruled Galilee for 25 years until Ottoman loyalist Jezzar Pasha conquered the region in 1775.\nIn 1831, the Galilee, a part of Ottoman Syria, switched hands from Ottomans to Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt until 1840. During this period, aggressive social and politic policies were introduced, which led to a violent 1834 Arab revolt. In the process of this revolt the Jewish community of Safed was greatly reduced, in the event of Safed Plunder by the rebels. The Arab rebels were subsequently defeated by the Egyptian troops, though in 1838, the Druze of Galilee led another uprising. In 1834 and 1837, major earthquakes leveled most of the towns, resulting in great loss of life.\nFollowing the 1864 Tanszimat reforms in the Ottoman Empire, the Galilee remained within Acre Sanjak, but was transferred from Sidon Eyalet to the newly formed Syria Vilayet and shortly, from 1888, became administered from Beirut Vilayet.\nIn 1866, Galilee's first hospital, the Nazareth Hospital, was founded under the leadership of American-Armenian missionary Dr. Kaloost Vartan, assisted by German missionary John Zeller.\nIn the early 20th century, Galilee remained part of Acre Sanjak of Ottoman Syria. It was administered as the southernmost territory of the Beirut Vilayet.\n### British administration\nFollowing the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, and the Armistice of Mudros, it came under British rule, as part of the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration. Shortly after, in 1920, the region was included in the British Mandate territory, officially a part of Mandatory Palestine from 1923.\n### Israeli period\nAfter the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, nearly the whole of Galilee came under Israel's control. A large portion of the population fled or was forced to leave, leaving dozens of entire villages empty; however, a large Israeli Arab community remained based in and near the cities of Nazareth, Acre, Tamra, Sakhnin, and Shefa-'Amr, due to some extent to a successful rapprochement with the Druze. The kibbutzim around the Sea of Galilee were sometimes shelled by the Syrian army's artillery until Israel seized Western Golan Heights in the 1967 Six-Day War.\nDuring the 1970s and the early 1980s, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) launched multiple attacks on towns and villages of the Upper and Western Galilee from Lebanon. This came in parallel to the general destabilization of Southern Lebanon, which became a scene of fierce sectarian fighting which deteriorated into the Lebanese Civil War. On the course of the war, Israel initiated Operation Litani (1979) and Operation Peace For Galilee (1982) with the stated objectives of destroying the PLO infrastructure in Lebanon, protecting the citizens of the Galilee and supporting allied Christian Lebanese militias. Israel took over much of southern Lebanon in support of Christian Lebanese militias until 1985, when it withdrew to a narrow security buffer zone.\nFrom 1985 to 2000, Hezbollah, and earlier Amal, engaged the South Lebanon Army supported by the Israel Defense Forces, sometimes shelling Upper Galilee communities with Katyusha rockets. In May 2000, Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak unilaterally withdrew IDF troops from southern Lebanon, maintaining a security force on the Israeli side of the international border recognized by the United Nations. The move brought a collapse to the South Lebanon Army and takeover of Southern Lebanon by Hezbollah. However, despite Israeli withdrawal, clashes between Hezbollah and Israel continued along the border, and UN observers condemned both for their attacks.\nThe 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict was characterized by round-the-clock Katyusha rocket attacks (with a greatly extended range) by Hezbollah on the whole of Galilee, with long-range, ground-launched missiles hitting as far south as the Sharon Plain, Jezreel Valley, and Jordan Valley below the Sea of Galilee.\n## Demography\nAs of 2006, there were 1.2 million residents in Galilee, of which 47% were Jewish. The Jewish Agency has attempted to increase the Jewish population in this area, but the non-Jewish population also has a high growth rate.\nThe largest cities in the region are Acre, Nahariya, Nazareth, Safed, Karmiel, Shaghur, Shefa-'Amr, Afula, and Tiberias. The port city of Haifa serves as a commercial center for the whole region.\nBecause of its hilly terrain, most of the people in the Galilee live in small villages connected by relatively few roads. A railroad runs south from Nahariya along the Mediterranean coast, and a fork to the east was opened in 2016. The main sources of livelihood throughout the area are agriculture and tourism. Industrial parks are being developed, bringing further employment opportunities to the local population which includes many recent immigrants. The Israeli government is contributing funding to the private initiative, the Galilee Finance Facility, organised by the Milken Institute and Koret Economic Development Fund.\nThe Galilee is home to a large Arab population, comprising a Muslim majority and two smaller populations, of Druze and Arab Christians, of comparable sizes. Both Israeli Druze and Christians have their majorities in the Galilee. Other notable minorities are the Bedouin, the Maronites and the Circassians.\nThe north-central portion of the Galilee is also known as Central Galilee, stretching from the border with Lebanon to the northern edge of the Jezreel Valley, including the cities of Nazareth and Sakhnin, has an Arab majority of 75% with most of the Jewish population living in hilltop cities like Upper Nazareth. The northern half of the central Lower Galilee, surrounding Karmiel and Sakhnin is known as the \"Heart of the Galilee\". The eastern Galilee is nearly 100% Jewish. This part includes the Finger of the Galilee, the Jordan River Valley, and the shores the Sea of Galilee, and contains two of Judaism's Four Holy Cities. The southern part of the Galilee, including Jezreel Valley, and the Gilboa region are also nearly 100% Jewish, with a few small Arab villages near the West Bank border. About 80% of the population of the Western Galilee is Jewish, all the way up to the Lebanese border. Jews also form a small majority in the mountainous Upper Galilee with a significant minority Arab population (mainly Druze and Christians).\nAs of 2011, the Galilee is attracting significant internal migration of Haredi Jews, who are increasingly moving to the Galilee and Negev as an answer to rising housing prices in central Israel.\n## Tourism\nGalilee is a popular destination for domestic and foreign tourists who enjoy its scenic, recreational, and gastronomic offerings. The Galilee attracts many Christian pilgrims, as many of the miracles of Jesus occurred, according to the New Testament, on the shores of the Sea of Galilee—including his walking on water, calming the storm, and feeding five thousand people in Tabgha. In addition, numerous sites of biblical importance are located in the Galilee, such as Megiddo, Jezreel Valley, Mount Tabor, Hazor, Horns of Hattin, and more.\nA popular hiking trail known as the yam leyam, or sea-to-sea, starts hikers at the Mediterranean. They then hike through the Galilee mountains, Tabor, Neria, and Meron, until their final destination, the Kinneret (Sea of Galilee).\nIn April 2011, Israel unveiled the \"Jesus Trail\", a 40-mile (60-km) hiking trail in the Galilee for Christian pilgrims. The trail includes a network of footpaths, roads, and bicycle paths linking sites central to the lives of Jesus and his disciples, including Tabgha, the traditional site of Jesus's miracle of the loaves and fishes, and the Mount of Beatitudes, where he delivered his Sermon on the Mount. It ends at Capernaum on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus espoused his teachings.\nMany kibbutzim and moshav families operate Zimmerim (from the Yiddish word for 'room', צימער, from 'Zimmer' in German, with the Hebrew ending for plural, -im; the local term for a Bed and breakfast). Numerous festivals are held throughout the year, especially in the autumn and spring holiday seasons. These include the Acre (Acco) Festival of Alternative Theater, the olive harvest festival, music festivals featuring Anglo-American folk, klezmer, Renaissance, and chamber music, and Karmiel Dance Festival.\n## Cuisine\nThe cuisine of the Galilee is very diverse. The meals are lighter than in the central and southern regions. Dairy products are heavily consumed (especially the Safed cheese that originated in the mountains of the Upper Galilee). Herbs like thyme, mint, parsley, basil, and rosemary are very common with everything including dips, meat, fish, stews and cheese. In the eastern part of the Galilee, there is freshwater fish as much as meat (especially the Tilapia that lives in the Sea of Galilee, Jordan river, and other streams in the region), including fish filled with thyme and grilled with rosemary to flavor, or stuffed with oregano leaves, then topped with parsley and served with lemon to squash. This technique exists in other parts of the country including the coasts of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. A specialty of the region is a baked Tilapia flavored with celery, mint and a lot of lemon juice. Baked fish with tahini is also common in Tiberias while the coastal Galileans prefer to replace the tahini with yogurt and add sumac on top.\nThe Galilee is famous for its olives, pomegranates, wine and especially its Labneh w'Za'atar which is served with pita bread, meat stews with wine, pomegranates and herbs such as akub, parsley, khalmit, mint, fennel, etc. are common. Galilean kubba is usually flavored with cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, concentrated pomegranate juice, onion, parsley and pine nuts and served as meze with tahini dip. Kebabs are also made almost in the same way with sumac replacing cardamom and with carob sometimes replacing the pomegranate juice. Because of its climate, beef has become more popular than lamb, although both are still eaten there. Dates are popular in the tropical climate of the Eastern Galilee.\n## Subregions\nThe definition of Galilee varies depending on the period, author, and point of view (geological, geographical, administrative). Ancient Galilee consisted in broad terms of the Upper and Lower Galilee. Today the northwestern part of the Upper Galilee is in Southern Lebanon, with the rest being in Israel. The Israeli Galilee is often divided into these subregions, which often overlap:\nUpper Galilee extends from the Beit HaKerem Valley northwards into southern Lebanon. Its eastern border is the Hula Valley and the Sea of Galilee separating it from the Golan Heights. To the west it reaches to the Coastal Plain which separates it from the Mediterranean. Lower Galilee covers the area north of the Valleys (Jezreel, Harod and Beth Shean Valley) and south of the Beit HaKerem Valley. Its borders to the east on the Jordan Rift Valley. It contains the Arab city of Nazareth and the village of Cana. The \"Galilee Panhandle\" (Hebrew: אצבע הגליל, Etzba HaGalil, lit. \"Finger of Galilee\") is a panhandle along the Hulah Valley, squeezed between the Lebanese border and the Golan Heights; it contains the towns of Metulla and Qiryat Shemona, the Dan and part of the Banias rivers.\nThe following subregions are sometimes regarded, from different points of view, as distinct from the Galilee, for instance the entire Jordan Valley including the Sea of Galilee and its continuation to the south as one geological and geographical unit, and the Jezreel, Harod, and Beit She'an valleys as \"the northern valleys\".\nThe Hula Valley The Korazim Plateau The Sea of Galilee and its valley The Jordan Valley from the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee down to Beit She'an The Jezreel Valley, including in its eastern part, the Harod Valley, which stretches between Afula and the Beit She'an Valley The Beit She'an Valley at the junction of the Jordan Valley and the extended Jezreel Valley Mount Gilboa The Western Galilee is a modern Israeli term, which in its minimal definition refers to the coastal plain just west of the Upper Galilee, also known as Plain of Asher or Plain of the Galilee, which stretches from north of Acre to Rosh HaNikra on the Israel-Lebanon border, and in the common broad definition adds the western part of Upper Galilee, and usually the northwestern part of Lower Galilee as well, corresponding more or less to Acre sub-district or the Northern District.", "Galilee, Hebrew Ha-galil, northernmost region of ancient Palestine, corresponding to modern northern Israel. Its biblical boundaries are indistinct; conflicting readings leave clear only that it was part of the territory of the northern tribe of Naphtali. The frontiers of this hilly area were set down by the Roman-Jewish historian Josephus (1st century ce). They were: ʿAkko (Acre) and Mount Carmel on the west; Samaria and Bet Sheʾan (Scythopolis) on the south; Transjordan on the east; and a line running through ancient Baca (probably modern Bezet) on the north, that line generally corresponding to the modern Israeli-Lebanese boundary. Some geographers extend Galilee’s border northward to the Nahr al-Līṭānī (Leontes River).\nGalilee is divided into two parts: Upper and Lower. Upper Galilee (chief city: Ẕefat) has higher peaks separated by narrow gorges and defiles. Lower Galilee (chief city: Nazareth) is a region of lower hills.\nGalilee\nWhen the Israelites took possession of Palestine, the Canaanites were strongly entrenched in Galilee. The Book of Judges (1:30–33) suggests that even after Joshua’s conquest, Jews and Canaanites lived together there. During the reigns of David and Solomon (10th century bce), Galilee was part of their expanded kingdom; subsequently, it came under the northern kingdom of Israel.\nIn 734 bce much of Galilee’s Jewish population was exiled after the victory of the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III over the Israelite kingdom. Later, the region became known as Jesus’ boyhood home and, thereafter, the site of most of his public ministry. Most of the miracles recounted in the New Testament were performed in Galilee. After the destruction of the Second Temple (70 ce) by the Romans, the centre of Jewish scholarship in Palestine moved to Galilee.\nGalilee became impoverished after the Arab conquest (636). In the Middle Ages Ẕefat was the principal centre of Kabbala, an esoteric Jewish mysticism.\nThe region’s revival in modern times is a result of Zionist colonizations. Beginning with the village of Rosh Pinna (Hebrew: “cornerstone”) in 1882, a string of settlements was set up; these proved to be key bargaining points in the inclusion of all Galilee in the British mandate (1920).\nThe United Nations partition plan (November 1947) envisioned the division of Galilee between Israel and the never-created Arab state in Palestine, but it all went to Israel after the 1948–49 Arab–Israeli war.\nA major change in Palestine’s physical geography was effected in Galilee in the 1950s when swampy Lake Ḥula, north of the Sea of Galilee, was drained; the Ḥula Valley was converted into fertile farmland and the upper course of the Jordan River straightened."], "selected_questions": ["Which Israelite tribes originally inhabited Galilee according to the Hebrew Bible?", "Which ancient kingdom included Galilee during the reigns of David and Solomon?", "Where did most of Jesus' public ministry take place?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["According to the Hebrew Bible, the Israelite tribes of Naphthali and Dan originally inhabited Galilee.

{"name": "Commagene", "documents": ["Commagene, region in northern ancient Syria (modern south-central Turkey) bounded by Cilicia on the west and Cappadocia on the north. Its eastern boundary on the Euphrates River, at the conjunction of several routes over the Taurus Mountains, gave Commagene a strategic position between the Roman and Parthian empires. Commagene broke free from the decaying Seleucid Empire about 162 bc. Its king, Antiochus I (c. 69–c. 34 bc), by adroitly playing off Rome against Parthia, brought the kingdom to its zenith—a fact attested by the splendid mausoleum built by Antiochus to his own memory on the peak of Nimrud Dağ. Commagene maintained a precarious independence until it was annexed by Rome in ad 17. After a brief restoration (38–72), it was permanently incorporated into the Roman province of Syria.", "# Commagene\nCommagene (Greek: Κομμαγηνή) was an ancient Greco-Iranian kingdom ruled by a Hellenized branch of the Iranian Orontid dynasty that had ruled over Armenia. The kingdom was located in and around the ancient city of Samosata, which served as its capital. The Iron Age name of Samosata, Kummuh, probably gives its name to Commagene.\nCommagene has been characterized as a \"buffer state\" between Armenia, Parthia, Syria, and Rome; culturally, it was correspondingly mixed. The kings of the Kingdom of Commagene claimed descent from Orontes with Darius I of Persia as their ancestor, by his marriage to Rhodogune, daughter of Artaxerxes II who had a family descent from king Darius I. The territory of Commagene corresponded roughly to the modern Turkish provinces of Adıyaman and northern Antep.\nLittle is known of the region of Commagene prior to the beginning of the 2nd century BC. However, it seems that, from what little evidence remains, Commagene formed part of a larger state that also included the Kingdom of Sophene. This situation lasted until c. 163 BC, when the local satrap, Ptolemaeus of Commagene, established himself as an independent ruler following the death of the Seleucid king, Antiochus IV Epiphanes.\nThe Kingdom of Commagene maintained its independence until 17 AD, when it was made a Roman province by Emperor Tiberius. It re-emerged as an independent kingdom when Antiochus IV of Commagene was reinstated to the throne by order of Caligula, then deprived of it by that same emperor, then restored to it a couple of years later by his successor, Claudius. The re-emergent state lasted until 72 AD, when the Emperor Vespasian finally and definitively made it part of the Roman Empire.\nOne of the kingdom's most lasting visible remains is the archaeological site on Mount Nemrut, a sanctuary dedicated by King Antiochus Theos to a number of syncretistic Graeco-Iranian deities as well as to himself and the deified land of Commagene. It is now a World Heritage Site.\n## Cultural identity\nThe cultural identity of the Kingdom of Commagene has been variously characterized. Pierre Merlat suggests that the Commagenian city of Doliche, like others in its vicinity, was \"half Iranianized and half Hellenized\". David M. Lang describes Commagene as \"a former Armenian satellite kingdom\", while Blömer and Winter call it a \"Hellenistic kingdom\". Millar suggests that a local dialect of Aramaic might have been spoken there, Fergus Millar considers that, \"in some parts of the Euphrates region, such as Commagene, nothing approaching an answer to questions about local culture is possible.\"\nWhile the language used on public monuments was typically Greek, Commagene's rulers made no secret of their Persian affinities. The kings of Commagene claimed descent from the Orontid Dynasty and would therefore have been related to the family that founded the Kingdom of Armenia; while Sartre states the accuracy of these claims is uncertain. At Antiochus Theos' sanctuary at Mount Nemrut, the king erected monumental statues of deities with mixed Greek and Iranian names, such as Zeus-Oromasdes, while celebrating his own descent from the royal families of Persia and Armenia in a Greek-language inscription.\nThe Commagenean rulers had Iranian and Greek names (Antiochus, Samos, Mithridates). The various Iranian onomasticons located in Commagene demonstrate the extensive Iranization in the region. Over the course of the first centuries BC and AD, the names given on a tomb at Sofraz Köy show a mix of \"typical Hellenistic dynastic names with an early introduction of Latin personal names.\" Lang notes the vitality of Graeco-Roman culture in Commagene.\nWhile few things about his origins are known with certainty, 2nd-century Attic Greek poet Lucian of Samosata claimed to have been born in Samosata in the former kingdom of Commagene, and described himself in one satirical work as \"an Assyrian\". Despite writing well after the Roman conquest of Commagene, Lucian claimed to be \"still barbarous in speech and almost wearing a jacket (kandys) in the Assyrian style\". This has been taken as a possible, but not definitive, allusion to the possibility that his native language was an Aramaic dialect.\nIn keeping with Commagene Greek and Iranian cultural elements, Antiochus' cult was a synthesis of Greco-Iranian religion, which had existed in Commagene before his time.\n## History\nCommagene was originally a small Syro-Hittite kingdom, located in modern south-central Turkey, with its capital at Samosata (modern Samsat, near the Euphrates). It was first mentioned in Assyrian texts as Kummuhu, which was normally an ally of Assyria, but eventually annexed as a province in 708 BC under Sargon II. The Achaemenid Empire then conquered Commagene in the 6th century BC and Alexander the Great conquered the territory in the 4th century BC. After the breakup of the Empire of Alexander the Great, the region became part of the Hellenistic Seleucids, and Commagene emerged in about 163 BC as a state and province in the Greco-Syrian Seleucid Empire. Perhaps Commagene was part of the kingdom of Armenia in the early Hellenistic period, and was possibly annexed to the Seleucid kingdom soon after Armenia's conquest\nThe Hellenistic kingdom of Commagene, bounded by Cilicia on the west and Cappadocia on the north, arose in 162 BC when its governor, Ptolemy, a satrap of the disintegrating Seleucid Empire, declared himself independent. Ptolemy's dynasty was related to the Parthian kings, but his descendant Mithridates I Callinicus (109 BC–70 BC) embraced Hellenistic culture and married the Syrian Greek Princess Laodice VII Thea. His dynasty could thus claim ties with both Alexander the Great and the Persian kings. This marriage may also have been part of a peace treaty between Commagene and the Seleucid Empire. From this point on, the kingdom of Commagene became more Greek than Persian. With Sophene, it was to serve as an important centre for the transmission of Hellenistic and Roman culture in the region. Details are sketchy, but Mithridates Callinicus is thought have accepted Armenian suzerainty during the reign of Tigranes II the Great.\nMithridates and Laodice's son was King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene (reigned 70 –38 BC). Antiochus was an ally of the Roman general Pompey during the latter's campaigns against Mithridates VI of Pontus in 64 BC. Thanks to his diplomatic skills, Antiochus was able to keep Commagene independent from the Romans. In 17 when Antiochus III of Commagene died, Emperor Tiberius annexed Commagene to the province of Syria. According to Josephus, this move was supported by the local nobility but opposed by the mass of the common people, who preferred to remain under their kings as before; Tacitus, on the other hand, states that \"most preferred Roman, but others royal rule\".\nIn 38 AD, Caligula reinstated Antiochus III's son Antiochus IV and also gave him the wild areas of Cilicia to govern. Antiochus IV was the only client king of Commagene under the Roman Empire. Deposed by Caligula and restored again upon Claudius' accession in 41, Antiochus reigned until 72, when Emperor Vespasian deposed the dynasty and definitively re-annexed the territory to Syria, acting on allegations \"that Antiochus was about to revolt from the Romans... reported by the Governor Caesennius Paetus\". The Legio VI Ferrata, which Paetus led into Commagene, was not resisted by the populace; a day-long battle with Antiochus' sons Epiphanes and Callinicus ended in a draw, and Antiochus surrendered. The Legio III Gallica would occupy the area by 73 AD. A 1st-century letter in Syriac by Mara Bar Serapion describes refugees fleeing the Romans across the Euphrates and bemoans the Romans' refusal to let the refugees return; this might describe the Roman takeover of either 18 or 72. The descendants of Antiochus IV lived prosperously and in distinction in Anatolia, Greece, Italy, and the Middle East. As a testament to the descendants of Antiochus IV, the citizens of Athens erected a funeral monument in honor of his grandson Philopappos, who was a benefactor of the city, upon his death in 116. Another descendant of Antiochus IV was the historian Gaius Asinius Quadratus, who lived in the 3rd century.\n## Geography\nCommagene extended from the right bank of the Euphrates to the Taurus and Amanus Mountains. Strabo, who counts Commagene as part of Syria, notes the kingdom's fertility. Its capital and chief city was Samosata (now submerged under Atatürk Reservoir).\nThe boundaries of Commagene fluctuated over time. Under Antiochus Theos, the Kingdom of Commagene controlled a particularly large area. Doliche was under Commagenian rule \"for about 35 years\"; after being governed by Antiochus Theos, it might have been incorporated into the Roman province of Syria as early as 31 BC. Germanicea declared itself a Commagenian city in Roman times, although originally it was not. On the other hand, Zeugma, while ruled for a time by Commagene, was popularly and traditionally considered to belong to the region of Cyrrhestica; Strabo says it had been assigned to Commagene by Pompey.\n## Archaeological remains\nThe limestone propaganda-like statues and refliefs built during Antiochus Theos' reign reflect the Parthian influence in their sculpture.\nWhen the Romans conquered Commagene, the great royal sanctuary at Mount Nemrut was abandoned. The Romans looted the burial tumuli of their goods and the Legio XVI Flavia Firma built and dedicated a bridge. The surrounding thick forests were cut down and cleared by the Romans for wood, timber and charcoal, causing much erosion to the area.\nAnother important archaeological site dating to the Kingdom of Commagene is the sanctuary of Zeus Soter at Damlıca, dedicated in the time of Mithridates II.\nIn Commagene, there is a column topped by an eagle, which has earned the mound the name Karakuş, or Black Bird. An inscription there indicates the presence of a royal tomb that housed three women. The vault of that tomb, however, has also been looted. The main excavations on the site were carried out by Friedrich Karl Dörner of the University of Münster. Another royal burial site is at Arsameia, which also served as a residence of the kings of Commagene.\nMany of the ancient artifacts from the Kingdom of Commagene are on display at the Adıyaman Archaeological Museum."], "selected_questions": ["When was Commagene annexed by Rome?", "What empires did Antiochus I play off against each other to bring Commagene to its zenith?", "What is one of the most notable archaeological sites in Commagene?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Commagene was annexed by Rome in AD 17.", "Antiochus I played off Rome against Parthia to bring Commagene to its zenith.", "One of the most notable archaeological sites in Commagene is the sanctuary on Mount Nemrut.

{"name": "Copán", "documents": ["# Copán\nCopán is an archaeological site of the Maya civilization in the Copán Department of western Honduras, not far from the border with Guatemala. This ancient Maya city mirrors the beauty of the physical landscape in which it flourished—a fertile, well-watered mountain valley in western Honduras at an elevation of 600 meters (1,970 feet) above mean sea level. It was the capital city of a major Classic period kingdom from the 5th to 9th centuries AD. The city was in the extreme southeast of the Mesoamerican cultural region, on the frontier with the Isthmo-Colombian cultural region, and was almost surrounded by non-Maya peoples.\nCopán was occupied for more than two thousand years, from the Early Preclassic period to the Postclassic. The city developed a distinctive sculptural style within the tradition of the lowland Maya, perhaps to emphasize the Maya ethnicity of the city's rulers.\nThe city has a historical record that spans the greater part of the Classic period and has been reconstructed in detail by archaeologists and epigraphers. Copán was a powerful city ruling a vast kingdom within the southern Maya area. The city suffered a major political disaster in AD 738 when Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, one of the greatest kings in Copán's dynastic history, was captured and executed by his former vassal, the king of Quiriguá. This unexpected defeat resulted in a 17-year hiatus at the city, during which time Copán may have been subject to Quiriguá in a reversal of fortunes.\nA significant portion of the eastern side of the acropolis was eroded away by the Copán River; the river has since been diverted to protect the site from further damage.\n## Names\nIt is thought likely that the ancient name of Copán was Oxwitik (pronounced ), meaning the \"Three Witiks\", although the meaning of the word witik itself remains obscure.\n## Location\nCopán is in western Honduras close to the border with Guatemala. It lies within the municipality of Copán Ruinas in the department of Copán. It is in a fertile valley among foothills at 700 meters (2,300 ft) above mean sea level. The ruins of the site core of the city are 1.6 kilometers (1 mi) from the modern village of Copán Ruinas, which is built on the site of a major complex dating to the Classic period.\nIn the Preclassic period the floor of the Copán Valley was undulating, swampy and prone to seasonal flooding. In the Early Classic, the inhabitants flattened the valley floor and undertook construction projects to protect the city's architecture from the effects of flooding.\nCopán had a major influence on regional centres across western and central Honduras, stimulating the introduction of Mesoamerican characteristics to local elites.\n## Population\nAt the peak of its power in the Late Classic, the kingdom of Copán had a population of at least 20,000 and covered an area of over 250 square kilometers (100 sq mi). The greater Copán area consisting of the populated areas of the valley covered about a quarter of the size of the city of Tikal. It is estimated that the peak population in central Copán was between 6000 and 9000 in an area of 0.6 square kilometers (0.23 sq mi), with a further 9,000 to 12,000 inhabitants occupying the periphery—an area of 23.4 square kilometers (9.0 sq mi). Additionally, there was an estimated rural population of 3,000 to 4,000 in a 476-square-kilometer (184 sq mi) area of the Copán Valley, giving an estimated total population of 18,000 to 25,000 people in the valley during the Late Classic period.\n## History\nLittle is known of the rulers of Copán before the founding of a new dynasty with its origins at Tikal in the early 5th century AD, although the city's origins can be traced back to the Preclassic period. After this, Copán became one of the more powerful Maya city states and was a regional power in the southern Maya region. However, it suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of its former vassal state Quirigua in 738, when the long-ruling king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was captured and beheaded by Quirigua's ruler K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat (Cauac Sky). Although this was a major setback, Copán's rulers began to build monumental structures again within a few decades.\nThe area of Copán continued to be occupied after the last major ceremonial structures and royal monuments were erected, but the population declined in the 8th and 9th centuries from perhaps over 20,000 in the city to less than 5,000. This decrease in population took over four centuries to actually show signs of collapse, showing the stability of this site even after the fall of the ruling dynasties and royal families. The ceremonial center was long abandoned and the surrounding valley home to only a few farming hamlets at the time of the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century.\n### Rulers\nReferences to the predynastic rulers of Copán are found in later texts, but none of these texts predate the refounding of Copán in AD 426.\n### Predynastic history\nThe fertile Copán River valley was long a site of agriculture before the first known stone architecture was built in the region about the 9th century BC. The city was important before its refounding by a foreign elite; mentions of the predynastic history of Copán are found in later texts, but none of these predates the refounding of the city in AD 426. There is an inscription that refers to the year 321 BC, but no text explains the significance of this date. An event at Copán is linked to another event that happened 208 days before in AD 159 at an unknown location that is also mentioned on a stela from Tikal, suggesting that it is a location somewhere in the Petén Basin, possibly the great Preclassic Maya city of El Mirador. This AD 159 date is mentioned in several texts and is linked to a figure known as \"Foliated Ajaw\". This same person is mentioned on the carved skull of a peccary recovered from Tomb 1, where he is said to perform an action with a stela in AD 376.\n### K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol\nThe city was refounded by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', establishing it as the capital of a new Maya kingdom. This coup was apparently organized and launched from Tikal. Texts record the arrival of a warrior named K'uk' Mo' Ajaw who was installed upon the throne of the city in AD 426 and given a new royal name, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and the ochk'in kaloomte \"Lord of the West\" title used a generation earlier by Siyaj K'ak', a general from the great metropolis of Teotihuacan who had decisively intervened in the politics of the central Petén. K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' was probably from Tikal and was likely to have been sponsored by Siyaj Chan K'awill II, the 16th ruler in the dynastic succession of Tikal. K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' may have legitimized his claim to rulership by marrying into the old Copán royal family, evidenced from the remains of his presumed widow. Bone analysis of her remains indicates that she was local to Copán. After the establishment of the new kingdom of Copán, the city remained closely allied with Tikal. The hieroglyphic text on Copán Altar Q describes the lord being elevated to kingship with the receipt of his royal scepter. The ceremonies involved in the founding of the Copán dynasty also included the installation of a subordinate king at Quiriguá.\nA text from Tikal mentions K'uk' Mo' and has been dated to AD 406, 20 years before K'uk' Mo' Ajaw founded the new dynasty at Copán. Both names are likely to refer to the same individual originally from Tikal. Although none of the hieroglyphic texts that mention the founding of the new Copán dynasty describe how K'uk' Mo' arrived at the city, indirect evidence suggests that he conquered the city by military means. On Altar Q he is depicted as a Teotihuacano warrior with goggle eyes and a war serpent shield. When he arrived at Copán he initiated the construction of various structures, including one temple in the talud-tablero style typical of Teotihuacan and another with inset corners and apron moldings that are characteristic of Tikal. These strong links with both the Maya and Central Mexican cultures suggest that he was at least a Mexicanized Maya or possibly even from Teotihuacan. The dynasty founded by king K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' ruled the city for four centuries and included sixteen kings plus a probable pretender who would have been seventeenth in line. Several monuments have survived that were dedicated by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and by his heir.\nK'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' died between AD 435 and AD 437. In 1995 a tomb underneath the talud-tablero Hunal temple was discovered by a team of archaeologists led by Robert Sharer and David Sedat. The tomb contained the skeleton of an elderly man with rich offerings and evidence of battle wounds. The remains have been identified as those of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' due to their location underneath a sequence of seven buildings erected in his honor. Bone analysis has identified the remains as being those of someone foreign to Copán.\nK'inich Popol Hol inherited the throne of Copán from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', who was his father. He undertook major construction projects with the redesign of the core of Copán. Popol Hol is not the original name of this king but rather a nickname based on the appearance of his Teotihuacan-linked name glyph. K'inich Popol Hol oversaw the construction of the first version of the Mesoamerican ballcourt at the city, which was decorated with images of the scarlet macaw, a bird that features prominently in Maya mythology. His greatest construction activity was in the area of his father's palace, now underlying Structure 10L-16, which he demolished after entombing his father there. He then built three successive buildings on top of the tomb in rapid succession.\n### Other early dynastic rulers\nVery little is known about Rulers 3 to 6 in the dynastic succession, although it is known from a fragment of a broken monument reused as construction fill in a later building that one of them was a son of Popol Hol. Ruler 3 is depicted on the 8th-century Altar Q, but his name glyph has broken away. Ku Ix was the 4th ruler in the succession. He rebuilt temple 10L-26 in the Acropolis, erecting a stela there and a hieroglyphic step at its base. Although this king is also mentioned on a few other fragments of sculpture, no dates accompany his name. The next two kings in the dynastic sequence are only known from their sculptures on Altar Q.\nB'alam Nehn (often referred to as Waterlily Jaguar) was the first king to actually record his position in the dynastic succession, declaring that he was seventh in line from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'. Stela 15 records that he was already ruling Copán by AD 504. B'alam Nehn is the only king of Copán to be mentioned in a hieroglyphic text from outside of the southeastern Maya region. His name appears in a text on Stela 16 from Caracol, a site in Belize. The stela dates to AD 534, but the text is not well understood. B'alam Nehn undertook major construction projects in the Acropolis, building over an early palace with a number of important structures.\nWil Ohl K'inich, the eighth ruler, is another king known only by his appearance on Altar Q. He was succeeded by Ruler 9 in AD 551, his accession being described on the Hieroglyphic Stairway. He is also depicted on Altar Q even though he ruled for less than two years.\nThe 10th ruler is nicknamed Moon Jaguar by Mayanists. He was a son of B'alam Nehn, the 7th ruler. He was enthroned in May 553. His surviving monuments were found in the modern village of Copán Ruinas, which was a major complex during the Classic period. The most famous construction dating to his reign is the elaborate Rosalila phase of Temple 16, discovered entombed intact under later phases of the temple during archaeological tunneling work.\n### K'ak' Chan Yopaat and Smoke Imix\nK'ak' Chan Yopaat was the eleventh dynastic ruler at Copán. He was crowned as king in AD 578, 24 days after the death of Moon Jaguar. At the time of his rule, Copán was undergoing an unprecedented rise in population, with residential land use spreading to all available land in the entire Copán Valley. The two surviving stelae of K'ak' Chan Yopaat contain long, hard-to-decipher hieroglyphic texts and are the oldest monuments at the site to survive without being either broken or buried. He reigned for 49 years until his death on 5 February 628. His name is recorded on four stelae erected by his successors, one of which describes a rite performed with relics from his tomb in AD 730, almost a hundred years after his death.\nSmoke Imix was crowned 16 days after the death of K'ak' Chan Yopaat. He is thought to have been the longest reigning king of Copán, ruling from 628 to 695. He is believed to have been born in AD 612 and to have become king at the age of 15. Archaeologists have recovered little evidence of activity for the first 26 years of his reign, but in AD 652 there was a sudden explosion of monument production, with two stelae being erected in the Great Plaza and a further four in important locations across the Copán Valley. These monuments all celebrated a k'atun-ending. He also erected a stela at the Santa Rita site 12 kilometers (7.5 mi) away and is mentioned on Altar L at Quiriguá in relation to the same event in 652. It is thought that he was trying to stamp his authority throughout the whole valley after the end of some earlier restriction to his freedom to rule as he wished.\nAfter this sudden spate of activity, Smoke Imix continued to rule until almost the end of the 7th century; he dedicated another nine known monuments and made important changes to the architecture of Copán, including the construction of Structure 2, which closes the northern side of the Great Plaza, and a new version of Temple 26, nicknamed Chorcha. Smoke Imix ruled Copán for 67 years and died on 15 June 695 at the age of 79, an age that was so distinguished that it is used to identify him in place of his name on Altar Q. His tomb had already been prepared in the Chorcha phase of Temple 26 and he was buried just two days after his death.\n### Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil\nUaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was crowned as the 13th king in the Copán dynasty in July 695. He oversaw both the apogee of Copán's achievements and also one of the city's most catastrophic political disasters. During his reign, the sculptural style of the city evolved into the full in-the-round sculpture characteristic of Copán. In AD 718, Copán attacked and defeated the unidentified site of Xkuy, recording its burning on an unusual stone cylinder. In AD 724 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil installed K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat as a vassal on the throne of Quiriguá. Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was confident enough in his power to rank his city among the four most powerful states in the Maya region, together with Tikal, Calakmul and Palenque, as recorded on Stela A. In contrast to his predecessor, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil concentrated his monuments in the site core of the Copán; his first was Stela J, dated to AD 702 and erected at the eastern entrance to the city.\nHe continued to erect a further seven high-quality stelae until AD 736, monuments that are considered masterpieces of Classic Maya sculpture with such mastery of detail that they represent the highest pinnacle of Maya artistic achievement. The stelae depict king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil ritually posed and bearing the attributes of a variety of deities, including B'olon K'awiil, K'uy Nik Ajaw and Mo' Witz Ajaw. The king also carried out major construction works, including a new version of Temple 26 that now bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, plus two temples that have now been lost to the erosion of the Copán River. He also encased the Rosalila phase of Temple 16 within a new phase of construction. He remodelled the ballcourt, then demolished it and built a new one in its place.\nUaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil had only recently dedicated the new ballcourt in AD 738 when a completely unexpected disaster befell the city. Twelve years earlier he had installed K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat on the throne of Quiriguá as his vassal. By 734 the king of Quiriguá had shown he was no longer an obedient subordinate when he began to refer to himself as k'ul ajaw, \"holy lord\", rather than simply as a subordinate lord ajaw. K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat appears to have taken advantage of wider political rivalries and allied himself with Calakmul, the sworn enemy of Tikal. Copán was firmly allied with Tikal and Calakmul used its alliance with Quiriguá to undermine Tikal's key ally in the south.\nAlthough the exact details are unknown, in April 738 K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat captured Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil and burned two of Copán's patron deities. Six days later Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was decapitated in Quiriguá. This coup does not seem to have physically affected either Copán or Quiriguá; there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute. All of this seems to imply that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. It has been suggested that Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was attempting to attack another site to secure captives for sacrifice in order to dedicate the new ballcourt when he was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quiriguá warriors.\nIn the Late Classic, alliance with Calakmul was frequently associated with the promise of military support. The fact that Copán, a much more powerful city than Quiriguá, failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul was far enough away from Quiriguá that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state, even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Copán. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage: Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quiriguá gained its independence. The disaster for Copán had long-lasting consequences; major construction ceased and no new monuments were raised for the next 17 years.\n### Later rulers\nK'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil was installed as the 14th dynastic ruler of Copán on 7 June 738, 39 days after the execution of Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. Little is known of his reign due to the lack of monuments raised after Quiriguá's surprise victory. Copán's defeat had wider implications due to the fracturing of the city's domain and the loss of the key Motagua River trade route to Quiriguá. The fall in Copán's income and corresponding increase at Quiriguá is evident from the massive commissioning of new monuments and architecture at the latter city, and Copán may even have been subject to its former vassal. K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil died in January 749.\nThe next ruler was K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil, a son of K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil. The early period of his rulership fell within Copán's hiatus, but later on he began a programme of renewal in an effort to recover from the city's earlier disaster. He built a new version of Temple 26, with the Hieroglyphic Stairway being reinstalled on the new stairway and doubled in length. Five life-size statues of seated rulers were installed seated upon the stairway. K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil died in the early 760s and is likely to have been interred in Temple 11, although the tomb has not yet been excavated.\nYax Pasaj Chan Yopaat was the next ruler, 16th in the dynasty founded by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', although he appears not to have been a direct descendant of his predecessor. He took the throne in June 763 and may have been only 9 years old. He produced no monumental stelae and instead dedicated hieroglyphic texts incorporated into the city's architecture and smaller altars. Texts make an obscure reference to his father but his mother was a noblewoman from distant Palenque in Mexico. He built the platform of Temple 11 over the tomb of the previous king in AD 769 and added a two-storey superstructure that was finished in AD 773. Around AD 776, he completed the final version of Temple 16 over the tomb of the founder. At the base of the temple, he placed the famous Altar Q, which shows each of the 16 rulers of the city from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' through to Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, with a hieroglyphic text on top describing the founding of the dynasty. By the latter 8th century, the nobility had become more powerful, raising palaces with hieroglyphic benches that were as richly constructed as those of the king. At the same time, local satellites were displaying their own local power, as demonstrated by the ruler of Los Higos erecting his own stela in AD 781. Towards the end of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat's reign, the city of Copán was struggling with overpopulation and a lack of local resources, with a distinct fall in living standards among the populace. Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat was able to celebrate his second K'atun in AD 802 with his own monument, but the king's participation in the K'atun ending ceremony of AD 810 was marked at Quiriguá, not at Copán. By this time the city's population was over 20,000 and it had long needed to import basic necessities from outside.\nThe troubled times enveloping Copán at this time are evident from the funerary tomb of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, which bears sculptures of the king performing war dances with spear and shield in hand. The sculpted column from the temple shrine has a hieroglyphic text reading \"toppling of the Foundation House\" that may refer to the fall of the Copán dynasty. Shortage and disease afflicted the massively overpopulated valley of Copán when its last known king, Ukit Took', came to the throne on 6 February 822. He commissioned Altar L in the style of Altar Q but the monument was never finished — one face shows the enthronement of the king and a second face was started but two others were completely blank. The long line of kings at the once great city had come to an end. Before the end, even the nobility had been struck by disease, perhaps because epidemics among the malnourished masses spread to the elite. With the end of political authority at the city the population collapsed to a fraction of what it had been at its height. This collapse of the city-state, which people believe occurred sometime between 800 and 830 AD, was sudden. However, the population continued to persist and even flourish between the years 750 and 900 AD, and then gradually declined soon thereafter. In the Postclassic period the valley was occupied by villagers who stole the stone from the monumental architecture of the city in order to build their simple house platforms.\n### Modern history\nThe first post-Spanish conquest mention of Copán was in an early colonial period letter dated 8 March 1576. The letter was written by Diego García de Palacio, a member of the Royal Audience of Guatemala, to king Philip II of Spain. French explorer Jean-Frédéric Waldeck visited the site in the early 19th century and spent a month there drawing the ruins. Colonel Juan Galindo led an expedition to the ruins in 1834 on behalf of the government of Guatemala and wrote articles about the site for English, French and North American publications. John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood visited Copán and included a description, map and detailed drawings in Stephens' Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatán, published in 1841. The site was later visited by British archaeologist Alfred Maudslay. Several expeditions sponsored by the Peabody Museum of Harvard University worked at Copán during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the 1892–1893 excavation of the Hieroglyphic Stairway by John G. Owens and George Byron Gordon. The Carnegie Institution also sponsored work at the site in conjunction with the government of Honduras.\nThe Copán buildings suffered significantly from forces of nature in the centuries between the site's abandonment and the rediscovery of the ruins. After the abandonment of the city the Copán River gradually changed course, with a meander destroying the eastern portion of the acropolis (revealing in the process its archaeological stratigraphy in a large vertical cut) and apparently washing away various subsidiary architectural groups, including at least one courtyard and 10 buildings from Group 10L–2. The cut is an important archaeological feature at the site, with the natural erosion having created an enormous cross-section of the acropolis. This erosion cut away a large portion of the eastern part of the acropolis and revealed a vertical cross-section that measures 37 meters (121 ft) high at its tallest point and 300 meters (980 ft) long. Several buildings recorded in the 19th century were destroyed, plus an unknown amount of the acropolis that was eroded before it could be recorded. In order to avoid further destruction of the acropolis, the Carnegie Institution redirected the river to save the archaeological site, diverting it southwards in the 1930s; the dry former riverbed was finally filled in at the same time as consolidation of the cut in 1990s. Structures 10L–19, 20, 20A and 21 were all destroyed by the Copán River as it eroded the site away, but had been recorded by investigators in the 19th century.\nCopán was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980, and the site was designated a cultural monument by the Honduran Government in 1982. UNESCO approved funding of US$95,825 between 1982 and 1999 for various works at the site. The cultural monument covers 66 hectares.\nLooting remains a serious threat to Copán. A tomb was looted in 1998 as it was being excavated by archaeologists.\n## Site description\nThe Copán site is known for a series of portrait stelae, most of which were placed along processional ways in the central plaza of the city and the adjoining acropolis, a large complex of overlapping step-pyramids, plazas, and palaces. The site has a large court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame.\nThe site is divided into various groups, with the Main Group and the Cemetery Group in the site core linked by a sacbe to the Sepulturas Group to the northeast. Central Copán had a density of 1449 structures per square kilometer (3,750/sq mi), while in greater Copán as a whole this density fell to 143 per square kilometre (370/sq mi) over a surveyed area of 24.6 square kilometers (9.5 sq mi).\n### Main Group\nThe Main Group represents the core of the ancient city and covers an area of 600 by 300 meters (1,970 ft × 980 ft). The main features are the Acropolis, which is a raised royal complex on the south side, and a group of smaller structures and linked plazas to the north, including the Hieroglyphic Stairway and the ballcourt. The Monument Plaza contains the greatest concentration of sculpted monuments at the site.\nThe Acropolis was the royal complex at the heart of Copán. It consists of two plazas that have been named the West Court and the East Court. They are both enclosed by elevated structures. Archaeologists have excavated extensive tunnels under the Acropolis, revealing how the royal complex at the heart of Copán developed over the centuries and uncovering several hieroglyphic texts that date back to the Early Classic and verify details of the early dynastic rulers of the city who were recorded on Altar Q hundreds of years later. The deepest of these tunnels have revealed that the first monumental structures underlying the Acropolis date archaeologically to the early 5th century AD, when K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' established the royal dynasty. These early buildings were built of stone and adobe and were themselves built upon earlier earth and cobble structures dating to the predynastic period. The two styles of building overlap somewhat, with some of the earthen structures being expanded during the first hundred years or so of the dynastic history of the city. The early dynastic masonry buildings of the Acropolis included several with the Early Classic apron-molding style of Tikal and one built in the talud-tablero style associated with Teotihuacan, although at the time the talud-tablero form was in use at both Tikal and Kaminaljuyu as well as in Central Mexico.\nStructure 10L-4 is a platform with four stairways situated by the Monument Plaza.\nStructure 10L-11 is on the west side of the Acropolis. It encloses the south side of the Court of the Hieroglyphic Stairway and is accessed from it by a wide monumental stairway. This structure appears to have been the royal palace of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, the 16th ruler in the dynastic succession and the last known king of Copán. Structure 10L-11 was built on top of several earlier structures, one of which probably contains the tomb of his predecessor K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil. A small tunnel descends into the interior of the structure, possibly to the tomb, but it has not yet been excavated by archaeologists. Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat built a new temple platform over his predecessor's tomb in AD 769. On top of this he placed a two-storey superstructure with a sculpted roof depicting the mythological cosmos. At each of its northern corners was a large sculpted Pawatun (a group of deities that supported the heavens). This superstructure had four doorways with panels of hieroglyphs sculpted directly onto the walls of the building. A bench inside the structure, removed by Maudslay in the nineteenth century and now in the British Museum's collection, once depicted the king's accession to the throne, overseen by deities and ancestors.\nStructure 10L-16 (Temple 16) is a temple pyramid that is the highest part of the Acropolis. It is located between the East and West Courts at the heart of the ancient city. The temple faces the West Court within the Acropolis and is dedicated to K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', the dynastic founder. The temple was placed on top of the original palace and tomb of the king. It is the final version of a number of temples built on top of each other, as was common practice in Mesoamerica. The earliest version of this temple is nicknamed Hunal; it was built in the talud-tablero style of architecture that was typical of Teotihuacan, with traces of brightly colored murals on the surviving traces of the interior walls. The king was buried in a vaulted crypt that was cut into the floor of the Hunal phase of the building, accompanied by rich offerings of jade. K'inich Popol Hol, son of the founder, demolished the palace of his father and built a platform on top of his tomb, named Yehnal by archaeologists. It was built in a distinctively Petén Maya style and bore large masks of K'inich Tajal Wayib', the sun god, which were painted red. This platform was encased within another much larger platform within a decade of its construction. This larger platform has been named Margarita and had stucco panels flanking its access stairway that bore entwined images of quetzals and macaws, which both form a part of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo's name. The Margarita phase contained a tomb with the richly accompanied burial of an elderly woman nicknamed the \"Lady in Red\". It is likely that she was the widow of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and the mother of K'inich Popol Hol. The upper chamber of the Margarita phase temple was converted to receive offerings and the unusual Xukpi stone, a dedicatory monument used in one of the earlier phases, was reused in this later phase.\nOne of the best preserved phases of Temple 16 is the Rosalila, built over the remains of five previous versions of the temple. Archaeologist Ricardo Agurcia discovered the almost intact shrine while tunneling underneath the final version of the temple. Rosalila is notable for its excellent state of preservation, including the entire building from the base platform up to the roof comb, including its highly elaborate painted stucco decoration. Rosalila features K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' placed at the centre of a mythological tableau, combining the founder of the dynasty with the sky deity Itzamna in avian form. The mythological imagery also includes anthropomorphic mountains, skeletons and crocodiles. Vents in the exterior were designed so smoke from incense being burned inside the shrine would interact with the stucco sculpture of the exterior. The temple had a hieroglyphic stone step with a dedicatory inscription. The stone step is less well preserved than the rest of the building, but a date in AD 571 has been deciphered. Due to the deforestation of the Copán valley, the Rosalila building was the last structure at the site to use such elaborate stucco decoration — vast quantities of firewood could no longer be spared to reduce limestone to plaster. A life-size copy of the Rosalila building has been built at the Copán site museum.\nUaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil encased the Rosalila phase under a new version of the building in the early 8th century AD. An offering was made as part of the rites to terminate the old phase and included a collection of eccentric flints worked into the profiles of humans and gods,wrapped in blue-dyed textiles, as well as a 5-ft shark brought to the city from the nearest ocean, some 42 km distant.\nStructure 10L-18 is on the southeastern side of the Acropolis and has been damaged by the erosion caused by the Copán River, having lost its eastern side. Stairs on the south side of the structure lead down to a vaulted tomb that was looted in ancient times and was probably that of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. It was apparently plundered soon after the collapse of the Copán kingdom. Unusually for Copán, the summit shrine had four sculpted panels depicting the king performing war dances with spear and shield, emphasizing the rising tensions as the dynasty came to its end.\nTemples 10L-20 and 10L-21 were probably both built by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. They were lost to the Copán River in the early 20th century.\nStructure 10L-22 is a large building on the north side of the East Court, in the Acropolis, and faces onto it. It dates to the reign of Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil and is the best preserved of the buildings from his rule. The superstructure of the building has an interior doorway with an elaborate sculpted frame and decorated with masks of the mountain god Witz. The outer doorway is framed by the giant mask of a deity, and has stylistic similarities with the Chenes regional style of distant Yucatán. The temple was built to celebrate the completion of the king's first K'atun in power, in AD 715, and has a hieroglyphic step with a first-person phrase \"I completed my K'atun\". The building symbolically represents the mountain where maize was created.\nStructure 10L-25 is in the East Court of the Acropolis. It covers a rich royal tomb nicknamed Sub-Jaguar by archaeologists. It is presumed to be the tomb of either Ruler 7 (B'alam Nehn), Ruler 8 or Ruler 9, who all ruled in the first half of the 6th century AD.\nStructure 10L-26 is a temple that projects northwards from the Acropolis and is immediately to the north of Structure 10L-22. The structure was built by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil and K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil, the 13th and 15th rulers in the dynastic succession. The 10-meter (33 ft) wide Hieroglyphic Stairway ascends the building on the west side from the courtyard below. The earliest version of the temple, nicknamed Yax, was built during the reign of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', the dynastic founder, and has architectural features (such as inset corners) that are characteristic of Tikal and the central Petén region. The next phase of the building was built by Yax K'uk' Mo's son K'inich Popol Hol and is nicknamed Motmot. This phase of the structure was more elaborate and was decorated with stucco. Set under the building was the Motmot capstone, covering a tomb with the unusual Teotihuacan-style burial of a woman, accompanied by a wide variety of offerings that included animal bones, mercury, jade and quartz, along with three severed human heads, all of which were male. Ku Ix built a new phase of the building over Motmot, nicknamed Papagayo.\nSmoke Imix demolished the Papagayo phase and ritually interred the broken remains of its sculpted monuments, accompanied by stone macaw heads from an early version of the ballcourt. He then built a pyramid over the earlier phases, nicknamed Mascarón by archaeologists. It in turn was developed into the Chorcha pyramid with the addition of a long superstructure with seven doorways at the front and back. Before a new building was built over the top, the upper sanctuary was demolished and a tomb was inserted into the floor and covered with 11 large stone slabs. The tomb contained the remains of an adult male and a sacrificed child. The adult's badly decayed skeleton was wrapped in a mat and accompanied by offerings of fine jade, including ear ornaments and a necklace of sculpted figurines. The burial was accompanied by offerings of 44 ceramic vessels, jaguar pelts, spondylus shells, 10 paintpots and one or more hieroglyphic books, now decayed. There were also 12 ceramic incense burners with lids modeled into human figurines, thought to represent Smoke Imix and his 11 dynastic predecessors. The Chorcha building was dedicated to the long-lived 7th-century king Smoke Imix and it is therefore likely that the remains interred in the building are his. Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil had sealed the Chorcha phase under a new version of the temple, nicknamed Esmeralda, by AD 710. The new phase bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, which contains a lengthy dynastic history. K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil built over the Esmeralda phase in the mid-8th century. He removed the Hieroglyphic Stairway from the earlier building and reinstalled it into his own version, while doubling the length of its text and adding five life-size statues of rulers dressed in the garb of Teotihuacano warriors, each seated on a step of the stairway. At the base of the stairway, he also raised Stela M, with his own image. The summit shrine of the temple bore a hieroglyphic text composed of full-figure hieroglyphs, each placed beside a similar glyph in faux-Mexican style, giving the appearance of a bilingual text.\nThe Hieroglyphic Stairway climbs the west side of Structure 10L-26. It is 10 meters (33 ft) wide and has a total of 62 steps. Stela M and its associated altar are at its base and a large sculpted figure is located in the centre of every 12th step. These figures are believed to represent the most important rulers in the dynastic history of the site. The stairway takes its name from the 2200 glyphs that together form the longest known Maya hieroglyphic text. The text is still being reconstructed, having been scrambled by the collapse of the glyphic blocks when the façade of the temple collapsed. The staircase measures 21 meters (69 ft) long and was first built by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in AD 710, being reinstalled and expanded in the following phase of the temple by K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil in AD 755.\nThe Ballcourt is immediately north of the Court of the Hieroglyphic Stairway and is to the south of the Monument Plaza. It was remodeled by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, who then demolished it and built a third version, which was one of the largest from the Classic period. It was dedicated to the great macaw deity and the buildings flanking the playing area carried 16 mosaic sculptures of the birds. The completion date of the ballcourt is inscribed with a hieroglyphic text upon the sloping playing area and is given as 6 January 738.\nThe Monument Plaza or Great Plaza is on the north side of the Main Group.\n### Sepulturas Group\nThe Sepulturas Group is linked by a sacbe or causeway that runs southwest to the Monument Plaza in the Main Group. The Sepulturas Group consists of a number of restored structures, mostly elite residences that feature stone benches, some of which have carved decorations, and a number of tombs.\nThe group has a very long occupational history, with one house having been dated as far back as the Early Preclassic. By the Middle Preclassic, large platforms were being built from cobbles and several rich burials were made. By AD 800, the complex consisted of about 50 buildings arranged around 7 major courtyards. At this time, the most important building was the House of the Bakabs, the palace of a powerful nobleman from the time of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. The building has a high-quality sculpted exterior and a carved hieroglyphic bench inside. A portion of the group was a subdistrict occupied by non-Maya inhabitants from Central Honduras who were involved in the trade network that brought in goods from that region.\n### Other groups\nThe North Group is a Late Classic compound. Archaeologists have excavated fallen façades that bear hieroglyphic inscriptions and sculpted decoration.\nThe Cemetery Group is immediately south of the Main Group and includes a number of small structures and plazas.\n### Monuments\nAltar Q is the most famous monument at Copán. It was dedicated by king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat in AD 776 and has each of the first 16 kings of the Copán dynasty carved around its side. Each figure is depicted seated on his name glyph. A hieroglyphic text is inscribed on the upper surface, relating the founding of the dynasty in AD 426–427. On one side, it shows the dynastic founder K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' transferring power to Yax Pasaj. Tatiana Proskouriakoff first discovered the inscription on the West Side of Altar Q that tells us the date of the inauguration of Yax Pasaj. This portrayal of political succession tells us much about Early Classic Maya culture.\nThe Motmot Capstone is an inscribed stone that was placed over a tomb under Structure 10L-26. Its face was finely sculpted with portraits of the first two kings of the Copán dynasty, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol, facing towards each other with a double column of hieroglyphs between them, all contained within a quatrefoil frame. The frame and the hieroglyphic names of mythological locations underneath the feet of the two kings place them in a supernatural realm. The capstone bears two calendrical dates, in AD 435 and AD 441. The second of these is probably the date that the capstone was dedicated.\nThe Xukpi Stone is a dedicatory monument from one of the earlier phases of the 10L-16 temple constructed to honor K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'. It bears the date of AD 437 and the names both K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol, together with a possible mention of the Teotihuacan general Siyaj K'ak'. The monument has not been completely deciphered and its style and phrasing are unusual. Originally it was used as a sculpted bench or step and the date on the monument is associated with the dedication of a funerary temple or a tomb, probably the tomb of K'inich' Yax K'uk' Mo', which was discovered underneath the same structure.\nStela 2 was erected in the Great Plaza by Smoke Imix in AD 652.\nStela 3 is another stela erected by Smoke Imix in the Great Plaza in AD 652.\nStela 4 was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in the early 8th century AD.\nStela 7 dates to the reign of K'ak' Chan Yopaat, and was erected to celebrate the K'atun-ending ceremony of AD 613. It was found in the western complex now underneath the modern village of Copán Ruinas. It bears a long hieroglyphic text that has been only partially deciphered.\nStela 9 was found in the modern village of Copán Ruinas, where it had been erected on the site of a major Classic period complex 1.6 kilometers (1 mi) outside of the site core. It was dedicated by Moon Jaguar and dates to AD 564.\nStela 10 was erected outside of the site core by Smoke Imix in AD 652.\nStela 11 was originally an interior column from Temple 18, the funerary shrine of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. When it was found, it was broken in two parts at the base of the temple. It portrays the king as the elderly Maya maize god and has imagery that seems to deliberately parallel the tomb lid of the Palenque king K'inich Janaab' Pakal, probably because of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat's close family ties to that city. The text of the column formed part of a longer text carved onto the interior walls of the temple and may describe the downfall of the Copán dynasty.\nStela 12 was erected outside of the site core by Smoke Imix in AD 652.\nStela 13 was erected outside the site core by Smoke Imix in AD 652.\nStela 15 is dated to AD 524, during the reign of B'alam Nehn. Its sculpture consists entirely of hieroglyphic text, which mentions that king B'alam Nehn was ruling the city by AD 504.\nStela 17 dates to AD 554, during the reign of Moon Jaguar. It originally stood in the nearby village of Copán Ruinas, which was a major complex in the Classic period.\nStela 18 is a fragment of a monument bearing the name of K'inich Popol Hol. It was erected in the inner chamber of the 10L-26 temple.\nStela 19 is a monument erected outside of the site core by Smoke Imix in AD 652.\nStela 63 was dedicated by K'inich Popol Hol. Its sculpture consists purely of finely carved hieroglyphic texts and it is possible that it was originally commissioned by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' with additional texts added to the sides of the monument by his son. The text contains the same date in AD 435 that appears on the Motmot Capstone. Stela 63 was deliberately broken, together with its hieroglyphic step, during the ritual demolishing of the Papagayo phase of Temple 26. The remains of the monuments were then interred in the building before the next phase was built.\nStela A was erected in 731 by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. It places his rulership among the four most powerful kingdoms in the Maya region, alongside Palenque, Tikal and Calakmul.\nStela B was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in the early 8th century AD.\nStela C was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in the early 8th century AD.\nStela D was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in the early 8th century AD.\nStela F was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in the early 8th century AD.\nStela H was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in the early 8th century AD.\nStela J was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in AD 702 and was his first monument. It stood at the eastern entrance to the city and is unusual in being topped by a sculpted stone roof, converting the monument into a symbolic house. It bears a hieroglyphic text that is woven into a criss-cross mat design to form a convoluted puzzle that must be read in precisely the right order to be understood.\nStela M bears a portrait of K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil. It was raised at the foot of the Hieroglyphic Stairway of Temple 26 in AD 756.\nStela N was dedicated by K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil in AD 761 and placed at the foot of the steps to Temple 11, which is believed to contain his burial.\nStela P was originally erected in an unknown location and was later moved to the West Court of the Acropolis. It bears a long hieroglyphic text that has not yet been fully deciphered. It dates from the reign of king K'ak' Chan Yopaat and was dedicated in AD 623.", "Copán, Honduras: Maya sculpture\nCopán\nCopán, ruined ancient Maya city, in extreme western Honduras near the Guatemalan border. It lies on the west bank of the Copán River, about 35 miles (56 km) west of the modern town of Santa Rosa de Copán. The site was added to the World Heritage List in 1980.\nCopán, Honduras: Maya altar\nCopán began as a small agricultural settlement about 1000 bce. It became an important Maya city during the Classic Period (c. 250–900 ce), and at its peak early in the 9th century it may have been home to as many as 20,000 people. A dynasty of at least 16 kings ruled Copán from about 426 to 822, by which latter date the city had entered a serious decline. The Maya had completely abandoned the site by about 1200.\nCopán, Honduras: tlachtli\nThe site comprises some 250 acres (100 hectares), including residential areas. Its central district covers 54 acres (22 hectares) and consists of stone temples, two large pyramids, several stairways and plazas, and a court for playing the ball game tlachtli (Mayan: pok-ta-pok). Most of these structures centre on a raised platform (now called the Acropolis) that was apparently the architectural centre of the ancient city. Copán is particularly noted for the friezes on some of its other buildings and the portrait sculptures on its many stelae. The Hieroglyphic Stairway, which leads to one of the temples, is beautifully carved with some 1,260 hieroglyphic symbols on the risers of its 63 remaining steps. There is evidence that astronomers in Copán calculated the most accurate solar calendar produced by the Maya up to that time.\nCopán: stela\nThe first Europeans to discover the site’s ruins were Spanish explorers in the late 16th century. The American travelers John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood rediscovered them in 1839, and in the 1930s and ’40s the ruins were restored by a group jointly sponsored by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C., and the government of Honduras.

{"name": "Prussia", "documents": ["Prussia, German Preussen, Polish Prusy, in European history, any of certain areas of eastern and central Europe, respectively (1) the land of the Prussians on the southeastern coast of the Baltic Sea, which came under Polish and German rule in the Middle Ages, (2) the kingdom ruled from 1701 by the German Hohenzollern dynasty, including Prussia and Brandenburg, with Berlin as its capital, which seized much of northern Germany and western Poland in the 18th and 19th centuries and united Germany under its leadership in 1871, and (3) the Land (state) created after the fall of the Hohenzollerns in 1918, which included most of their former kingdom and which was abolished by the Allies in 1947 as part of the political reorganization of Germany after its defeat in World War II. flag of Prussia\nThe original Prussians, mainly hunters and cattle breeders, spoke a language belonging to the Baltic group of the Indo-European language family. These early Prussians were related to the Latvians and Lithuanians and lived in tribes in the then heavily forested region between the lower Vistula and Neman rivers. Their social organization was loose—although some elements of stratified society can be traced—and they were pagans. Early attempts to convert the Prussians to Christianity—notably those made by Saint Adalbert and Saint Bruno of Querfurt at the turn of the 11th century—were unsuccessful. In the 13th century, however, the Prussians were conquered and Christianized by the German-speaking knights of the Teutonic Order, which had been awarded Prussian lands by the Polish duke Conrad of Mazovia for help against Prussian incursions. The Prussian countryside was subdued, castles were built for German nobility, and many German peasants were settled there to farm the land. By the middle of the 14th century, the majority of the inhabitants of Prussia were German-speaking, though the Old Prussian language did not die out until the 17th century. By the 17th century the indigenous population was thoroughly assimilated.\nThe latter part of the 14th century was characterized in eastern Europe by a strong reaction among Slavs and Balts against the Germans. Poland and Lithuania formed their first dynastic union in 1386 and, in the 15th century, defeated the Teutonic Knights in a series of wars. By the Second Treaty of Toruń (1466) the Polish crown acquired direct sovereignty over the Teutonic Order’s former possessions to the west of the lower Vistula River, together with the Kulmerland (or Chełmno district) and Ermland (Warmia) to the east; and that part of Prussia east of the Vistula River (i.e., East Prussia) was left to the order only on condition that the grand, or high, master should hold it as fief of the Polish crown. The lands along the Vistula, under Polish sovereignty, became known as Royal Prussia; thus a wedge of predominantly Polish-speaking territory came to be consolidated between German-speaking East Prussia and the German Reich to the west.\n## Ducal Prussia and the Kingdom of Prussia, to 1786\nAlbertThe Teutonic Order’s last grand master in Prussia, Albert of Hohenzollern, became a Lutheran and, in 1525, secularized his fief, which he transformed into a duchy for himself. Thereafter until 1701 this territory (i.e., East Prussia) was known as Ducal Prussia. When Albert’s son and successor, Albert Frederick, died sonless in 1618, the duchy passed to his eldest daughter’s husband, the Hohenzollern elector of Brandenburg, John Sigismund.\nThe union of Ducal Prussia with Brandenburg was fundamental to the rise of the Hohenzollern monarchy to the rank of a great power in Europe. John Sigismund’s grandson Frederick William of Brandenburg, the Great Elector (reigned 1640–88), obtained by military intervention in the Swedish-Polish War of 1655–60 and by diplomacy at the Peace of Oliva (1660) the ending of Poland’s suzerainty over Ducal Prussia. This made the Hohenzollerns sovereign over Ducal Prussia, whereas Brandenburg and their other German territories were still nominally parts of the Reich under the theoretical suzerainty of the Holy Roman emperor. Frederick William was also able to set up a centralized administration in Prussia and to wrest control of the duchy’s financial resources from the nobility.\nFrederick IThe most significant achievement of the Great Elector’s son Frederick (reigned 1688–1713) was to secure the royal dignity for himself as Frederick I, king in Prussia, crowning himself at Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) on January 18, 1701. Thereafter, the other Hohenzollern possessions, though theoretically remaining within the German Reich and under the ultimate overlordship of the Holy Roman emperor, soon came to be treated in practice rather as belonging to the Prussian kingdom than as distinct from it.\nFrederick William IFrederick I’s son Frederick William I began his reign in 1713 shortly before the conclusion of the Treaty of Utrecht, which assigned to him not only the so-called Upper Quarter of Geldern on the Meuse River but also the principality of Neuchâtel and Valengin on the border of France and Switzerland. Through participation in the Second Northern War, he further acquired much of western Pomerania (1720).\nFrederick William I endowed the Prussian state with its military and bureaucratic character. He raised the army to 80,000 men (equivalent to 4 percent of the population) and geared the whole organization of the state to the military machine. One half of his army consisted of hired foreigners. The other half was recruited from the king’s own subjects on the basis of the “canton system,” which made all young men of the lower classes—mostly peasants—liable for military service. While the upper bourgeoisie was exempted from military service, the nobles were under a moral obligation, which the king repeatedly emphasized, to serve in the officers’ corps.\nThe close coordination of military, financial, and economic affairs was complemented by Frederick William I’s reorganization of the administrative system, and he came to control the whole life of the state. His autocratic temperament and his fanatical addiction to work found expression in complete absolutism. To his son and successor, Frederick II (the Great), he left the best-trained army in Europe, a financial reserve of 8,000,000 thalers, productive domains, provinces developed through large-scale colonization (particularly East Prussia), and a hardworking, thrifty, conscientious bureaucracy.\nFrederick IIFrederick II (reigned 1740–86) put the newly realized strength of the Prussian state at the service of an ambitious but risky foreign policy. Hailed by Voltaire as “the philosopher king” personifying the Enlightenment and its ideal of peace, Frederick astonished Europe within seven months of his accession to the throne by invading Silesia in December 1740. This bold stroke precipitated the War of the Austrian Succession, and the Austro-Prussian Silesian Wars continued, with uneasy intermissions, until the end of the Seven Years’ War in 1763. Silesia, a rich province with many flourishing towns and an advanced economy, was an important acquisition for Prussia. Frederick’s wars not only established his personal reputation as a military genius but also won recognition for Prussia as one of the Great Powers.\nFirst Partition of PolandBesides Silesia, Frederick also acquired East Frisia on the North Sea coast, and later, at the First Partition of Poland in 1772, he obtained West Prussia, that is, Polish Royal Prussia, thus forming a territorial link between East (Ducal) Prussia and the rest of his domains to the west.\nFrederick made no substantial changes in the administrative system as organized by his father, but he did effect improvements in the judicial and educational systems and in the promotion of the arts and sciences. The freedom of conscience that Frederick instituted was the product not merely of his own skeptical indifference to religious questions but also of a deliberate intention to bring the various churches together for the benefit of the state and to allow more scope to the large Roman Catholic minority of his subjects in relation both to the Protestant majority and to the Evangelical establishment.", "# Prussia\nPrussia was a German state on the southeast coast of the Baltic Sea. It formed the German Empire under Prussian rule when it united the German states in 1871. It was de facto dissolved by an emergency decree transferring powers of the Prussian government to German Chancellor Franz von Papen in 1932 and de jure by an Allied decree in 1947. For centuries, the House of Hohenzollern ruled Prussia, expanding its size with the Prussian Army. Prussia, with its capital at Königsberg and then, when it became the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701, Berlin, decisively shaped the history of Germany.\nIn 1871, Prussian Minister-President Otto von Bismarck united most German principalities into the German Empire under his leadership, although this was considered to be a \"Lesser Germany\" because Austria and Switzerland were not included. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 1918–19. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republic—the Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1932, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup and the Nazi Gleichschaltung laws, which established a unitary state. Its legal status finally ended in 1947.\nThe name Prussia derives from the Old Prussians; in the 13th century, the Teutonic Knights—an organized Catholic medieval military order of German crusaders—conquered the lands inhabited by them. In 1308, the Teutonic Knights conquered the region of Pomerelia with Danzig (modern-day Gdańsk). Their monastic state was mostly Germanised through immigration from central and western Germany, and, in the south, it was Polonised by settlers from Masovia. The imposed Second Peace of Thorn (1466) split Prussia into the western Royal Prussia, becoming a province of Poland, and the eastern part, from 1525 called the Duchy of Prussia, a feudal fief of the Crown of Poland up to 1657. The union of Brandenburg and the Duchy of Prussia in 1618 led to the proclamation of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701.\nPrussia entered the ranks of the great powers shortly after becoming a kingdom. It became increasingly large and powerful in the 18th and 19th centuries. It had a major voice in European affairs under the reign of Frederick the Great (1740–1786). At the Congress of Vienna (1814–15), which redrew the map of Europe following Napoleon's defeat, Prussia acquired rich new territories, including the coal-rich Ruhr. The country then grew rapidly in influence economically and politically, and became the core of the North German Confederation in 1867, and then of the German Empire in 1871. The Kingdom of Prussia was now so large and so dominant in the new Germany that Junkers and other Prussian élites identified more and more as Germans and less as Prussians.\nThe Kingdom ended in 1918 along with other German monarchies that were terminated by the German Revolution. In the Weimar Republic, the Free State of Prussia lost nearly all of its legal and political importance following the 1932 coup led by Franz von Papen. Subsequently, it was effectively dismantled into Nazi German Gaue in 1935. Nevertheless, some Prussian ministries were kept and Hermann Göring remained in his role as Minister President of Prussia until the end of World War II. Former eastern territories of Germany that made up a significant part of Prussia lost the majority of their German population after 1945 as the Polish People's Republic and the Soviet Union both absorbed these territories and had most of its German inhabitants expelled by 1950. Prussia, deemed a bearer of militarism and reaction by the Allies, was officially abolished by an Allied declaration in 1947. The international status of the former eastern territories of the Kingdom of Prussia was disputed until the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany in 1990, but its return to Germany remains a topic among far right politicians, the Federation of Expellees and various political revisionists.\nThe term Prussian has often been used, especially outside Germany, to emphasise professionalism, aggressiveness, militarism and conservatism of the Junker class of landed aristocrats in the East who dominated first Prussia and then the German Empire.\n## Symbols\nThe main coat of arms of Prussia, as well as the flag of Prussia, depicted a black eagle on a white background.\nThe black and white national colours were already used by the Teutonic Knights and by the Hohenzollern dynasty. The Teutonic Order wore a white coat embroidered with a black cross with gold insert and black imperial eagle. The combination of the black and white colours with the white and red Hanseatic colours of the free cities Bremen, Hamburg and Lübeck, as well as of Brandenburg, resulted in the black-white-red commercial flag of the North German Confederation, which became the flag of the German Empire in 1871.\nSuum cuique (\"to each, his own\"), the motto of the Order of the Black Eagle created by King Frederick I in 1701, was often associated with the whole of Prussia. The Iron Cross, a military decoration created by King Frederick William III in 1813, was also commonly associated with the country. The region, originally populated by Baltic Old Prussians who were Christianised, became a favoured location for immigration by (later mainly Protestant) Germans (see Ostsiedlung), as well as Poles and Lithuanians along the border regions.\n## Territory\nBefore its abolition, the territory of the Free State of Prussia included the provinces of East Prussia; Brandenburg; Saxony (including much of the present-day state of Saxony-Anhalt and parts of the state of Thuringia in Germany); Pomerania; Rhineland; Westphalia; Silesia (without Austrian Silesia); Schleswig-Holstein; Hanover; Hesse-Nassau; and a small detached area in the south called Hohenzollern, the ancestral home of the Prussian ruling family. The land that the Teutonic Knights occupied was flat and covered with fertile soil. The area was perfectly suited to the large-scale raising of wheat. The rise of early Prussia was based on the raising and selling of wheat. Teutonic Prussia became known as the \"bread basket of Western Europe\" (in German, Kornkammer, or granary). The port cities which rose on the back of this wheat production included: Stettin in Pomerania (now Szczecin, Poland); Danzig in Prussia (now Gdańsk, Poland); Riga in Livonia (now Riga, Latvia); Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia); and Memel in Prussia (now Klaipėda, Lithuania). Wheat production and trade brought Prussia into a close relationship with the Hanseatic League during the period of time from 1356 (official founding of the Hanseatic League) until the decline of the League in about 1500.\nThe expansion of Prussia based on its connection with the Hanseatic League cut both Poland and Lithuania off from the coast of the Baltic Sea and trade abroad. This meant that Poland and Lithuania would be traditional enemies of Prussia, which was still called the Teutonic Knights.\n## History\n### Teutonic Order\nIn 1211 King Andrew II of Hungary granted Burzenland in Transylvania as a fiefdom to the Teutonic Knights, a German military order of crusading knights, headquartered in the Kingdom of Jerusalem at Acre. In 1225 he expelled them, and they transferred their operations to the Baltic Sea area. Konrad I, the Polish duke of Masovia, had unsuccessfully attempted to conquer pagan Prussia in crusades in 1219 and 1222. In 1226 Duke Konrad invited the Teutonic Knights to conquer the Baltic Prussian tribes on his borders.\nDuring 60 years of struggles against the Old Prussians, the Order established an independent state that came to control Prūsa. After the Livonian Brothers of the Sword joined the Teutonic Order in 1237, the Order also controlled Livonia (now Latvia and Estonia). Around 1252 they finished the conquest of the northernmost Prussian tribe of the Skalvians as well as of the western Baltic Curonians, and erected Memel Castle, which developed into the major port city of Memel (Klaipėda). The Treaty of Melno defined the final border between Prussia and the adjoining Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1422.\nThe Hanseatic League officially formed in northern Europe in 1356 as a group of trading cities. This League came to hold a monopoly on all trade leaving the interior of Europe and Scandinavia and on all sailing trade in the Baltic Sea for foreign countries.\nIn the course of the Ostsiedlung (German eastward expansion) process, settlers were invited, bringing changes in the ethnic composition as well as in language, culture, and law of the eastern borders of the German lands. As a majority of these settlers were Germans, Low German became the dominant language.\nThe Knights of the Teutonic Order were subordinate to the papacy and to the emperor. Their initially close relationship with the Polish Crown deteriorated after they conquered Polish-controlled Pomerelia and Danzig (Gdańsk) in 1308. Eventually, Poland and Lithuania, allied through the Union of Krewo (1385), defeated the Knights in the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg) in 1410.\nThe Thirteen Years' War (1454–1466) began when the Prussian Confederation, a coalition of Hanseatic cities of western Prussia, rebelled against the Order and requested help from the Polish king, Casimir IV Jagiellon. The Teutonic Knights were forced to acknowledge the sovereignty of, and to pay tribute to Casimir IV in the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), losing western Prussia (Royal Prussia) to Poland in the process. Pursuant to the Second Peace of Thorn, two Prussian states were established.\nDuring the period of the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights, mercenaries from the Holy Roman Empire were granted lands by the Order and gradually formed a new landed Prussian nobility, from which the Junkers would evolve to take a major role in the militarization of Prussia and, later, Germany.\n### Duchy of Prussia\nOn 10 April 1525, after signing of the Treaty of Kraków, which officially ended the Polish–Teutonic War (1519–21), in the main square of the Polish capital Kraków, Albert I resigned his position as Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights and received the title \"Duke of Prussia\" from King Zygmunt I the Old of Poland. As a symbol of vassalage, Albert received a standard with the Prussian coat of arms from the Polish king. The black Prussian eagle on the flag was augmented with a letter \"S\" (for Sigismundus) and had a crown placed around its neck as a symbol of submission to Poland. Albert I, a member of a cadet branch of the House of Hohenzollern became a Lutheran Protestant and secularized the Order's Prussian territories. This was the area east of the mouth of the Vistula River, later sometimes called \"Prussia proper\". For the first time, these lands came into the hands of a branch of the Hohenzollern family, who already ruled the Margraviate of Brandenburg, since the 15th century. Furthermore, with his renunciation of the Order, Albert could now marry and produce legitimate heirs.\n### Brandenburg-Prussia\nBrandenburg and Prussia united two generations later. In 1594 Anna, granddaughter of Albert I and daughter of Duke Albert Frederick (reigned 1568–1618), married her cousin Elector John Sigismund of Brandenburg. When Albert Frederick died in 1618 without male heirs, John Sigismund was granted the right of succession to the Duchy of Prussia, then still a Polish fief. From this time the Duchy of Prussia was in personal union with the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The resulting state, known as Brandenburg-Prussia, consisted of geographically disconnected territories in Prussia, Brandenburg, and the Rhineland lands of Cleves and Mark.\nDuring the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), various armies repeatedly marched across the disconnected Hohenzollern lands, especially the occupying Swedes. The ineffective and militarily weak Margrave George William (1619–1640) fled from Berlin to Königsberg, the historic capital of the Duchy of Prussia, in 1637. His successor, Frederick William I (1640–1688), reformed the army to defend the lands.\nFrederick William I went to Warsaw in 1641 to render homage to King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland for the Duchy of Prussia, which was still held in fief from the Polish crown. In January 1656, during the first phase of the Second Northern War (1654–1660), he received the duchy as a fief from the Swedish king who later granted him full sovereignty in the Treaty of Labiau (November 1656). In 1657 the Polish king renewed this grant in the treaties of Wehlau and Bromberg. With Prussia, the Brandenburg Hohenzollern dynasty now held a territory free of any feudal obligations, which constituted the basis for their later elevation to kings.\nFrederick William I succeeded in organizing the electorate by establishing an absolute monarchy in Brandenburg-Prussia, an achievement for which he became known as the \"Great Elector\". Above all, he emphasised the importance of a powerful military to protect the state's disconnected territories, while the Edict of Potsdam (1685) opened Brandenburg-Prussia for the immigration of Protestant refugees (especially Huguenots), and he established a bureaucracy to carry out state administration efficiently.\n### Kingdom of Prussia\nOn 18 January 1701, Frederick William's son, Elector Frederick III, elevated Prussia from a duchy to a kingdom and crowned himself King Frederick I. In the Crown Treaty of 16 November 1700, Leopold I, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, allowed Frederick only to title himself \"King in Prussia\", not \"King of Prussia\". The state of Brandenburg-Prussia became commonly known as \"Prussia\", although most of its territory, in Brandenburg, Pomerania, and western Germany, lay outside Prussia proper. The Prussian state grew in splendour during the reign of Frederick I, who sponsored the arts at the expense of the treasury.\nFrederick I was succeeded by his son, Frederick William I (1713–1740), the austere \"Soldier King\", who did not care for the arts but was thrifty and practical. He was the main creator of the vaunted Prussian bureaucracy and the professionalised standing army, which he developed into one of the most powerful in Europe. His troops only briefly saw action during the Great Northern War. In view of the size of the army in relation to the total population, Mirabeau said later: \"Prussia, is not a state with an army, but an army with a state.\" Frederick William also settled more than 20,000 Protestant refugees from Salzburg in thinly populated eastern Prussia, which was eventually extended to the west bank of the River Memel, and other regions. In the treaty of Stockholm (1720), he acquired half of Swedish Pomerania.\nThe king died in 1740 and was succeeded by his son, Frederick II, whose accomplishments led to his reputation as \"Frederick the Great\". As crown prince, Frederick had focused, primarily, on philosophy and the arts. He was an accomplished flute player. In 1740, Prussian troops crossed over the undefended border of Silesia and occupied Schweidnitz. Silesia was the richest province of Habsburg Austria. It signalled the beginning of three Silesian Wars (1740–1763). The First Silesian War (1740–1742) and the Second Silesian War (1744–1745) have, historically, been grouped together with the general European war called the War of Austrian Succession (1740–1748). Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI had died on 20 October 1740. He was succeeded to the throne by his daughter, Maria Theresa.\nBy defeating the Austrian Army at the Battle of Mollwitz on 10 April 1741, Frederick succeeded in conquering Lower Silesia (the northwestern half of Silesia). In the next year, 1742, he conquered Upper Silesia (the southeastern half). Furthermore, in the third Silesian War (usually grouped with the Seven Years' War) Frederick won a victory over Austria at the Battle of Lobositz on 1 October 1756. In spite of some impressive victories afterward, his situation became far less comfortable the following years, as he failed in his attempts to knock Austria out of the war and was gradually reduced to a desperate defensive war. However, he never gave up and on 3 November 1760 the Prussian king won another battle, the hard-fought Battle of Torgau. Despite being several times on the verge of defeat Frederick, allied with Great Britain, Hanover and Hesse-Kassel, was finally able to hold the whole of Silesia against a coalition of Saxony, the Habsburg monarchy, France and Russia. Voltaire, a close friend of the king, once described Frederick the Great's Prussia by saying \"...it was Sparta in the morning, Athens in the afternoon.\"\nSilesia, full of rich soils and prosperous manufacturing towns, became a vital region to Prussia, greatly increasing the nation's area, population, and wealth. Success on the battleground against Austria and other powers proved Prussia's status as one of the great powers of Europe. The Silesian Wars began more than a century of rivalry and conflict between Prussia and Austria as the two most powerful states operating within the Holy Roman Empire (although both had extensive territory outside the empire). In 1744, the County of East Frisia fell to Prussia following the extinction of its ruling Cirksena dynasty.\nIn the last 23 years of his reign until 1786, Frederick II, who understood himself as the \"first servant of the state\", promoted the development of Prussian areas such as the Oderbruch. At the same time he built up Prussia's military power and participated in the First Partition of Poland with Austria and Russia in 1772, an act that geographically connected the Brandenburg territories with those of Prussia proper. During this period, he also opened Prussia's borders to immigrants fleeing from religious persecution in other parts of Europe, such as the Huguenots. Prussia became a safe haven in much the same way that the United States welcomed immigrants seeking freedom in the 19th century.\nFrederick the Great (reigned 1740–1786) practised enlightened absolutism. He built the world's best army, and usually won his many wars. He introduced a general civil code, abolished torture and established the principle that the Crown would not interfere in matters of justice. He also promoted an advanced secondary education, the forerunner of today's German gymnasium (grammar school) system, which prepares the brightest pupils for university studies. The Prussian education system was emulated in various countries, including the United States.\n#### Napoleonic Wars\nDuring the reign of King Frederick William II (1786–1797), Prussia annexed additional Polish territory through the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 and the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. His successor, Frederick William III (1797–1840), announced the union of the Prussian Lutheran and Reformed churches into one church.\nPrussia took a leading part in the French Revolutionary Wars, but remained quiet for more than a decade because of the Peace of Basel of 1795, only to go once more to war with France in 1806 as negotiations with that country over the allocation of the spheres of influence in Germany failed. Prussia suffered a devastating defeat against Napoleon Bonaparte's troops in the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, leading Frederick William III and his family to flee temporarily to Memel. Under the Treaties of Tilsit in 1807, the state lost about one-third of its area, including the areas gained from the second and third Partitions of Poland, which now fell to the Duchy of Warsaw. Beyond that, the king was obliged to pay a large indemnity, to cap his army at 42,000 men, and to let the French garrison troops throughout Prussia, effectively making the Kingdom a French satellite.\nIn response to this defeat, reformers such as Stein and Hardenberg set about modernising the Prussian state. Among their reforms were the liberation of peasants from serfdom, the Emancipation of Jews and making full citizens of them. The school system was rearranged, and in 1818 free trade was introduced. The process of army reform ended in 1813 with the introduction of compulsory military service for men. By 1813, Prussia could mobilize almost 300,000 soldiers, more than half of which were conscripts of the Landwehr of variable quality. The rest consisted of regular soldiers that were deemed excellent by most observers, and very determined to repair the humiliation of 1806.\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon in Russia, Prussia quit its alliance with France and took part in the Sixth Coalition during the \"Wars of Liberation\" (Befreiungskriege) against the French occupation. Prussian troops under Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher contributed crucially (alongside the British and Dutch) to the final victory over Napoleon in the Battle of Waterloo of June 1815. Prussia's reward in 1815 at the Congress of Vienna was the recovery of her lost territories, as well as the whole of the Rhineland, Westphalia, 40% of Saxony and some other territories. These western lands were of vital importance because they included the Ruhr Area, the centre of Germany's fledgling industrialisation, especially in the arms industry. These territorial gains also meant the doubling of Prussia's population. In exchange, Prussia withdrew from areas of central Poland to allow the creation of Congress Poland under Russian sovereignty. In 1815 Prussia became part of the German Confederation.\n#### Wars of liberation\nThe first half of the 19th century saw a prolonged struggle in Germany between liberals, who wanted a united, federal Germany under a democratic constitution, and conservatives, who wanted to maintain Germany as a patchwork of independent, monarchical states with Prussia and Austria competing for influence. One small movement that signalled a desire for German unification in this period was the Burschenschaft student movement, by students who encouraged the use of the black-red-gold flag, discussions of a unified German nation, and a progressive, liberal political system. Because of Prussia's size and economic importance, smaller states began to join its free trade area in the 1820s. Prussia benefited greatly from the creation in 1834 of the German Customs Union (Zollverein), which included most German states but excluded Austria.\nIn 1848 the liberals saw an opportunity when revolutions broke out across Europe. Alarmed, King Frederick William IV agreed to convene a National Assembly and grant a constitution. When the Frankfurt Parliament offered Frederick William the crown of a united Germany, he refused on the grounds that he would not accept a crown from a revolutionary assembly without the sanction of Germany's other monarchs.\nThe Frankfurt Parliament was forced to dissolve in 1849, and Frederick William issued Prussia's first constitution by his own authority in 1850. This conservative document provided for a two-house parliament. The lower house, or Landtag was elected by all taxpayers, who were divided into three classes whose votes were weighted according to the amount of taxes paid. Women and those who paid no taxes had no vote. This allowed just over one-third of the voters to choose 85% of the legislature, all but assuring dominance by the more well-to-do men of the population. The upper house, which was later renamed the Herrenhaus (\"House of Lords\"), was appointed by the king. He retained full executive authority and ministers were responsible only to him. As a result, the grip of the landowning classes, the Junkers, remained unbroken, especially in the eastern provinces.\n#### Wars of unification\nIn 1862 King Wilhelm I appointed Otto von Bismarck as Prime Minister of Prussia. Bismarck was determined to defeat both the liberals and conservatives and increase Prussian supremacy and influence among the German states. There has been much debate as to whether Bismarck actually planned to create a united Germany when he set out on this journey, or whether he simply took advantage of the circumstances that fell into place. Bismarck curried support from large sections of the people by promising to lead the fight for greater German unification. He successfully guided Prussia through three wars, which unified Germany and brought William the position of German Emperor.\n##### Schleswig Wars\nThe Kingdom of Denmark was at the time in personal union with the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, both of which had close ties with each other, although only Holstein was part of the German Confederation. When the Danish government tried to integrate Schleswig, but not Holstein, into the Danish state, Prussia led the German Confederation against Denmark in the First War of Schleswig (1848–1851). Because Russia supported Austria, Prussia also conceded predominance in the German Confederation to Austria in the Punctation of Olmütz in 1850.\nIn 1863, Denmark introduced a shared constitution for Denmark and Schleswig. This led to conflict with the German Confederation, which authorised the occupation of Holstein by the Confederation, from which Danish forces withdrew. In 1864, Prussian and Austrian forces crossed the border between Holstein and Schleswig initiating the Second War of Schleswig. The Austro-Prussian forces defeated the Danes, who surrendered both territories. In the resulting Gastein Convention of 1865 Prussia took over the administration of Schleswig while Austria assumed that of Holstein.\n##### Austro-Prussian War\nBismarck realised that the dual administration of Schleswig and Holstein was only a temporary solution, and tensions rose between Prussia and Austria. The struggle for supremacy in Germany then led to the Austro-Prussian War (1866), triggered by the dispute over Schleswig and Holstein, with Bismarck using proposed injustices as the reason for war.\nOn the Austrian side stood the south German states (including Bavaria and Württemberg), some central German states (including Saxony), and Hanover in the north. On the side of Prussia were Italy, most north German states, and some smaller central German states. Eventually, the better-armed Prussian troops won the crucial victory at the Battle of Königgrätz under Helmuth von Moltke the Elder. The century-long struggle between Berlin and Vienna for the dominance of Germany was now over. As a sideshow in this war, Prussia defeated Hanover in the Battle of Langensalza (1866). While Hanover hoped in vain for help from Britain (as they had previously been in personal union), Britain stayed out of a confrontation with a continental great power and Prussia satisfied its desire for merging the once separate territories and gaining strong economic and strategic power, particularly from the full access to the resources of the Ruhr.\nBismarck desired Austria as an ally in the future, and so he declined to annex any Austrian territory. But in the Peace of Prague in 1866, Prussia annexed four of Austria's allies in northern and central Germany—Hanover, Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), Nassau and Frankfurt. Prussia also won full control of Schleswig-Holstein. As a result of these territorial gains, Prussia now stretched uninterrupted across the northern two-thirds of Germany and contained two-thirds of Germany's population. The German Confederation was dissolved, and Prussia impelled the 21 states north of the Main River into forming the North German Confederation.\nPrussia was the dominant state in the new confederation, as the kingdom comprised almost four-fifths of the new state's territory and population. Prussia's near-total control over the confederation was secured in the constitution drafted for it by Bismarck in 1867. Executive power was held by a president, assisted by a chancellor responsible only to him. The presidency was a hereditary office of the Hohenzollern rulers of Prussia. There was also a two-house parliament. The lower house, or Reichstag (Diet), was elected by universal male suffrage. The upper house, or Bundesrat (Federal Council) was appointed by the state governments. The Bundesrat was, in practice, the stronger chamber. Prussia had 17 of 43 votes, and could easily control proceedings through alliances with the other states.\nAs a result of the peace negotiations, the states south of the Main remained theoretically independent, but received the (compulsory) protection of Prussia. Additionally, mutual defence treaties were concluded. However, the existence of these treaties was kept secret until Bismarck made them public in 1867 when France tried to acquire Luxembourg.\n##### Franco-Prussian War\nThe controversy with the Second French Empire over the candidacy of a Hohenzollern to the Spanish throne was escalated both by France and Bismarck. With his Ems Dispatch, Bismarck took advantage of an incident in which the French ambassador had approached William. The government of Napoleon III, expecting another civil war among the German states, declared war against Prussia, continuing Franco-German enmity. However, honouring their treaties, the German states joined forces and quickly defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Following victory under Bismarck's and Prussia's leadership, Baden, Württemberg and Bavaria, which had remained outside the North German Confederation, accepted incorporation into a united German Empire.\nThe empire was a \"Lesser German\" solution (in German, \"kleindeutsche Lösung\") to the question of uniting all German-speaking peoples into one state, because it excluded Austria, which remained connected to Hungary and whose territories included non-German populations. On 18 January 1871 (the 170th anniversary of the coronation of King Frederick I), William was proclaimed \"German Emperor\" (not \"Emperor of Germany\") in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles outside Paris, while the French capital was still under siege.\n#### German Empire\nThe two decades after the unification of Germany were the peak of Prussia's fortunes, but the seeds for potential strife were built into the Prusso-German political system.\nThe constitution of the German Empire was a version of the North German Confederation's constitution. Officially, the German Empire was a federal state. In practice, Prussia overshadowed the rest of the empire. Prussia included three-fifths of the German territory and two-thirds of its population. The Imperial German Army was, in practice, an enlarged Prussian army, although the other kingdoms (Bavaria, Saxony and Württemberg) retained their own small armies. There was at first no navy. The imperial crown was a hereditary office of the House of Hohenzollern, the royal house of Prussia. The prime minister of Prussia was, except for two brief periods (January–November 1873 and 1892–94), also imperial chancellor. But the empire itself had no right to collect taxes directly from its subjects; the only incomes fully under federal control were the customs duties, common excise duties, and the revenue from postal and telegraph services. While all men above age 25 were eligible to vote in imperial elections, Prussia retained its restrictive three-class voting system. This effectively required the king/emperor and prime minister/chancellor to seek majorities from legislatures elected by two different franchises. In both the kingdom and the empire, the original constituencies were never redrawn to reflect changes in population, meaning that rural areas were grossly overrepresented by the turn of the 20th century.\nAs a result, Prussia and the German Empire were something of a paradox. Bismarck knew that his new German Reich was now a colossus and economically and militarily dominant in Europe; Britain was still dominant in finance and trade. He declared Germany a \"satisfied\" power, using his talents to preserve peace, for example at the Congress of Berlin. Bismarck did not set up his own party. He had mixed success in some of his domestic policies. His anti-Catholic Kulturkampf inside Prussia (and not the wider German state) was a failure. He ended his support for the anticlerical Liberals and worked instead with the Catholic Centre Party. He tried to destroy the socialist movement, with limited success. The large Polish population resisted Germanisation.\nFrederick III became emperor in March 1888, after the death of his father, but he died of cancer only 99 days later.\nAt age 29, Wilhelm became Kaiser Wilhelm II after a difficult youth and conflicts with his British mother Victoria, Princess Royal. He turned out to be a man of limited experience, narrow and reactionary views, poor judgment, and occasional bad temper, which alienated former friends and allies.\n### Railways\nPrussia nationalised its railways in the 1880s in an effort both to lower rates on freight service and to equalise those rates among shippers. Instead of lowering rates as far as possible, the government ran the railways as a profit-making endeavour, and the railway profits became a major source of revenue for the state. The nationalisation of the railways slowed the economic development of Prussia because the state favoured the relatively backward agricultural areas in its railway building. Moreover, the railway surpluses substituted for the development of an adequate tax system.\n### The Free State of Prussia in the Weimar Republic\nBecause of the German Revolution of 1918, Wilhelm II abdicated as German Emperor and King of Prussia. Prussia was proclaimed a \"Free State\" (i.e. a republic, German: Freistaat) within the new Weimar Republic and in 1920 received a democratic constitution.\nAlmost all of Germany's territorial losses, specified in the Treaty of Versailles, were areas that had been part of Prussia: Eupen and Malmedy to Belgium; North Schleswig to Denmark; the Memel Territory to Lithuania; the Hultschin area to Czechoslovakia. Many of the areas Prussia annexed in the partitions of Poland, such as the Provinces of Posen and West Prussia, as well as eastern Upper Silesia, went to the Second Polish Republic. Danzig became the Free City of Danzig under the administration of the League of Nations. Also, the Saargebiet was created mainly from formerly Prussian territories except present Saarpfalz district was part of Kingdom of Bavaria. East Prussia became an exclave, only reachable by ship (the Sea Service East Prussia) or by a railway through the Polish corridor.\nThe German government seriously considered breaking up Prussia into smaller states, but eventually traditionalist sentiment prevailed and Prussia became by far the largest state of the Weimar Republic, comprising 60% of its territory. With the abolition of the older Prussian franchise, it became a stronghold of the left. Its incorporation of \"Red Berlin\" and the industrialised Ruhr Area, both with working-class majorities, ensured left-wing dominance.\nFrom 1919 to 1932, Prussia was governed by a coalition of the Social Democrats, Catholic Centre and German Democrats; from 1921 to 1925, coalition governments included the German People's Party. Unlike in other states of the German Reich, majority rule by democratic parties in Prussia was never endangered. Nevertheless, in East Prussia and some rural areas, the Nazi Party of Adolf Hitler gained more and more influence and popular support, especially from the lower middle class starting in 1930. Except for Catholic Upper Silesia, the Nazi Party in 1932 became the largest party in most parts of the Free State of Prussia. However, the democratic parties in coalition remained a majority, while Communists and Nazis were in the opposition.\nThe East Prussian Otto Braun, who was Prussian minister-president almost continuously from 1920 to 1932, is considered one of the most capable Social Democrats in history. He implemented several trend-setting reforms together with his minister of the interior, Carl Severing, which were also models for the later Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). For instance, a Prussian minister-president could be forced out of office only if there was a \"positive majority\" for a potential successor. This concept, known as the constructive vote of no confidence, was carried over into the Basic Law of the FRG. Most historians regard the Prussian government during this time as far more successful than that of Germany as a whole.\nIn contrast to its pre-war authoritarianism, Prussia was a pillar of democracy in the Weimar Republic. This system was destroyed by the Preußenschlag (\"Prussian coup\") of Reich Chancellor Franz von Papen. In this coup d'état, the government of the Reich deposed the Prussian government on 20 July 1932, under the pretext that the latter had lost control of public order in Prussia (during the Bloody Sunday of Altona, Hamburg, which was still part of Prussia at that time) and by using fabricated evidence that the Social Democrats and the Communists were planning a joint putsch. The Defence Minister General Kurt von Schleicher, who was the prime mover behind the coup manufactured evidence that the Prussian police under Braun's orders were favouring the Communist Rotfrontkämpferbund in street clashes with the SA as part of an alleged plan to foment a Marxist revolution, which he used to get an emergency decree from President Paul von Hindenburg imposing Reich control on Prussia. Papen appointed himself Reich commissioner for Prussia and took control of the government. The Preußenschlag made it easier, only half a year later, for Hitler to take power decisively in Germany, since he had the whole apparatus of the Prussian government, including the police, at his disposal.\n### Prussia and the Third Reich\nAfter the appointment of Hitler as the new chancellor, the Nazis used the absence of Franz von Papen as an opportunity to appoint Hermann Göring federal commissioner for the Prussian ministry of the interior. The Reichstag election of 5 March 1933 strengthened the position of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP or \"Nazi\" Party), although they did not achieve an absolute majority.\nThe Reichstag building having been set on fire a few weeks earlier on 27 February, a new Reichstag was opened in the Garrison Church of Potsdam on 21 March 1933 in the presence of President Paul von Hindenburg. In a propaganda-filled meeting between Hitler and the Nazi Party, the \"marriage of old Prussia with young Germany\" was celebrated, to win over the Prussian monarchists, conservatives and nationalists and induce them into supporting and subsequently voting in favor of the Enabling Act of 1933.\nIn the centralised state created by the Nazis in the \"Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich\" (\"Gesetz über den Neuaufbau des Reichs\", 30 January 1934) and the \"Law on Reich Governors\" (\"Reichsstatthaltergesetz\", 30 January 1935) the states were dissolved, in fact if not in law. The federal state governments were now controlled by governors for the Reich who were appointed by the chancellor. Parallel to that, the organisation of the party into districts (Gaue) gained increasing importance, as the official in charge of a Gau (the head of which was called a Gauleiter) was again appointed by the chancellor who was at the same time chief of the Nazi Party.\nThis centralising policy went even further in Prussia. From 1934 to 1945, almost all ministries were merged and only a few departments were able to maintain their independence. Hitler himself became formally the governor of Prussia. However, his functions were exercised by Hermann Göring as Prussian prime minister.\nAs provided for in the \"Greater Hamburg Act\" (\"Groß-Hamburg-Gesetz\"), certain exchanges of territory took place. Prussia was extended on 1 April 1937, for instance, by the incorporation of the Free and Hanseatic City of Lübeck.\nThe Prussian lands transferred to Poland after the Treaty of Versailles were re-annexed during World War II. However, most of this territory was not reintegrated back into Prussia but assigned to separate Gaue of Danzig-West Prussia and Wartheland during much of the duration of the war.\n### The end of Prussia\nThe areas east of the Oder-Neisse line, mainly Eastern Prussia, Western Prussia, and Silesia, were ceded over to Poland and the Soviet Union in 1945 owing to the Treaty of Potsdam between three of the Allies: the United States, United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. This included important Prussian cities like Danzig, Königsberg, Breslau, and Stettin. The population fled, mostly to the Western zones, or was driven out.\nAs part of their wartime goals, the Western allies sought the abolition of Prussia. Stalin was initially content to retain the name, Russians having a different historical view of their neighbour and sometime former ally. Nonetheless, by Law No. 46, which was accepted and implemented by the Allied Control Council on 25 February 1947, Prussia was officially proclaimed to be dissolved.\nIn the Soviet occupation zone, which became East Germany (officially, the German Democratic Republic) in 1949, the former Prussian territories were reorganised into the states of Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt, with the remaining parts of the Province of Pomerania going to Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. These states were de facto abolished in 1952 in favour of Bezirke (districts), but were recreated after German reunification in 1990.\nIn the Western Zones of occupation, which became West Germany (officially, the Federal Republic of Germany) in 1949, the former Prussian territories were divided up among North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate and Schleswig-Holstein. Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern were later merged with Baden to create the state of Baden-Württemberg. The Saar region, which had been administered by the French as a protectorate separate from the rest of Western Germany, was admitted to the Federal Republic of Germany as a separate state following the 1955 Saar Statute referendum.\nOne year later, in 1957, the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation was established and implemented by federal statutes in West Germany in response to a ruling from the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. The fundamental goal of this institution is protecting the cultural legacy of Prussia. As of 2021, it continues to operate from its headquarters in Berlin.\n## Administrative and constitutional frameworks\nIn the mid-16th century the margraves of Brandenburg had become highly dependent on the Estates (representing counts, lords, knights, and towns, but not prelates, owing to the Protestant Reformation in 1538). The margraviate's liabilities and tax income as well as the margrave's finances were in the hands of the Kreditwerk, an institution not controlled by the elector, and of the Großer Ausschuß (\"Great Committee\") of the Estates. This was because of concessions made by Elector Joachim II in 1541 in return for financial aid by the estates; however, the Kreditwerk went bankrupt between 1618 and 1625. The margraves further had to yield to the veto of the Estates in all issues concerning the \"better or worse of the country\", in all legal commitments, and in all issues concerning pawn or sale of the elector's real property.\nTo reduce the influence of the Estates, in 1604, Joachim Frederick created a council called Geheimer Rat für die Kurmark (\"Privy Council for the Electorate\", which instead of the Estates would function as the supreme advisory council for the elector. While the council was permanently established in 1613, it failed to gain any influence until 1651, owing to the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648)\nUntil after the Thirty Years' War, the various territories of Brandenburg-Prussia remained politically independent from each other, connected only by the common feudal superior. Frederick William (ruled 1640–1688), who envisioned the transformation of the personal union into a real union, started to centralise the Brandenburg-Prussian government with an attempt to establish the Geheimer Rat as a central authority for all territories in 1651, but this project proved infeasible. Instead, the elector continued to appoint a governor (Kurfürstlicher Rat) for each territory, who in most cases was a member of the Geheimer Rat. The most powerful institution in the territories remained the governments of the estates (Landständische Regierung, named Oberratsstube in Prussia and Geheime Landesregierung in Mark and Cleves), which were the highest government agencies regarding jurisdiction, finances and administration. The elector attempted to balance the Estates' governments by creating Amtskammer chambers to administer and coordinate the elector's domains, tax income and privileges. Such chambers were introduced in Brandenburg in 1652, in Cleves and Mark in 1653, in Pomerania in 1654, in Prussia in 1661 and in Magdeburg in 1680. Also in 1680, the Kreditwerk came under the aegis of the elector.\nFrederick William I's excise tax (Akzise), which from 1667 replaced the property tax raised in Brandenburg for Brandenburg-Prussia's standing army with the Estates' consent, was raised by the elector without consultation with the Estates. The conclusion of the Second Northern War of 1655–1660 had strengthened the elector politically, enabling him to reform the constitution of Cleves and Mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of the local estates. In the Duchy of Prussia he confirmed the traditional privileges of the Estates in 1663, but the latter accepted the caveat that these privileges were not to be used to interfere with the exertion of the elector's sovereignty. As in Brandenburg, Frederick William ignored the privilege of the Prussian Estates to confirm or veto taxes raised by the elector: while in 1656, an Akzise was raised with the Estates' consent, the elector by force collected taxes not approved by the Prussian Estates for the first time in 1674. From 1704 the Prussian estates de facto relinquished their right to approve the elector's taxes while formally still entitled to do so. In 1682 the elector introduced an Akzise to Pomerania and in 1688 to Magdeburg, while in Cleves and Mark an Akzise was introduced only between 1716 and 1720. Owing to Frederick William I's reforms, the state income increased threefold during his reign, and the tax burden per subject reached a level twice as high as in France.\nUnder the rule of Frederick III (I) (in office: 1688–1713), the Brandenburg Prussian territories were de facto reduced to provinces of the monarchy. Frederick William's testament would have divided Brandenburg-Prussia among his sons, but his firstborn son Frederick III (I), with the emperor's backing, succeeded in becoming the sole ruler based on the Treaty of Gera of 1599, which forbade a division of Hohenzollern territories. In 1689, a new central chamber for all Brandenburg-Prussian territories was established, called Geheime Hofkammer (from 1713: Generalfinanzdirektorium). This chamber functioned as a superior agency of the territories' Amtskammer chambers. The General War Commissariat (Generalkriegskommissariat) emerged as a second central agency, superior to the local Kriegskommissariat agencies initially concerned with the administration of the army, but before 1712 transformed into an agency also concerned with general tax and police tasks.\nThe Kingdom of Prussia functioned as an absolute monarchy until the German revolutions of 1848–1849, after which Prussia became a constitutional monarchy and Adolf Heinrich von Arnim-Boitzenburg was elected as Prussia's first prime minister (Ministerpräsident). Prussia's first constitution dated from 1848. The 1850 Prussian Constitution established a two-chamber parliament. The lower house, or Landtag represented all taxpayers, who were divided into three classes according to the amount of taxes paid. This allowed just over 25% of the voters to choose 85% of the legislature, all but assuring dominance by the more well-to-do elements of the population. The upper house (First Chamber or Erste Kammer), later renamed the Prussian House of Lords (Herrenhaus), was appointed by the king. He retained full executive authority and ministers were responsible only to him. As a result, the grip of the landowning classes, the Junkers, remained unbroken, especially in the eastern provinces. The Prussian Secret Police, formed in response to the German revolutions of 1848–1849, aided the conservative government.\n### Prussia inside Weimar Republic\nUnlike its authoritarian pre-1918 predecessor, Prussia from 1918 to 1932 was a promising democracy within Germany. The abolition of the political power of the aristocracy transformed Prussia into a region strongly dominated by the left wing of the political spectrum, with \"Red Berlin\" and the industrial centre of the Ruhr Area exerting major influence. During this period a coalition of centre-left parties ruled, predominantly under the leadership (1920–1932) of East Prussian Social Democrat Otto Braun. While in office Braun implemented several reforms (together with his Minister of the Interior, Carl Severing) that became models for the later Federal Republic of Germany. For instance, a Prussian prime minister could only be forced out of office if there was a \"positive majority\" for a potential successor. This concept, known as the constructive vote of no confidence, became part of the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany. Historians regard the Prussian government during the 1920s as far more successful than that of Germany as a whole.\nSimilar to other German states both now and at the time, executive power remained vested in a Minister-President of Prussia and in laws established by a Landtag elected by the people.\n## Social history\n### Population\nIn 1871, Prussia's population numbered 24.69 million, accounting for 60% of the German Empire's population. The population grew rapidly from 45 million in 1880 to 56 million in 1900, thanks to declining mortality, even as birth rates declined. About 6 million Germans, primarily young families migrated to the United States, especially the mid-western farming regions. Their place in agriculture was often taken by young Polish farm workers. In addition, large numbers of Polish miners moved to Upper Silesia and many Germans and Poles moved to industrial jobs in the fast-growing cities especially in the Rhineland and Westphalia. In 1910, the population had increased to 40.17 million (62% of the Empire's population). In 1914, Prussia had an area of 354,490 km2. In May 1939 Prussia had an area of 297,007 km2 and a population of 41,915,040 inhabitants.\n### Religion\nThe Duchy of Prussia was the first state to officially adopt Lutheranism in 1525. In the wake of the Reformation, Prussia was dominated by two major Protestant confessions: Lutheranism and Calvinism. The majority of the Prussian population was Lutheran, although there were dispersed Calvinist minorities in central and western parts of the state especially Brandenburg, Rhineland, Westphalia and Hesse-Nassau. In 1613, John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg and Grand Duke of Prussia declared himself for the Calvinist creed and transferred the Berlin Cathedral from the Lutheran to the Calvinist church. Lutherans and Calvinist congregations all over the kingdom were merged in 1817 by the Prussian Union of churches, which came under tight royal control. In Protestant regions, writes Nipperdey:\nMuch of religious life was often conventional and superficial by any normal, human standard. The state and the bureaucracy kept their distance, preferring to spoon-feed the churches and treat them like children. They saw the churches as channels for education, as a means of instilling morality and obedience, or for propagating useful things, just like bee-keeping or potato-farming.\nPrussia received significant Huguenot population after the issuing of the Edict of Fontainebleau by Louis XIV of France and the following dragonnades. Prussian monarchs, beginning with Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg opened the country to the fleeing French Calvinist refugees. In Berlin, they built and worshipped at their own church called the French Cathedral on Gendarmenmarkt. Time passed by, and the French Reformed assimilated into the wider Protestant community in Prussia. East Prussia's southern region of Masuria was mostly made up of Germanised Lutheran Masurians.\nAfter 1814, Prussia contained millions of Catholics in the west and in the east. There were substantial populations in the Rhineland, parts of Westphalia, eastern parts of Silesia, West Prussia, Ermland and the Province of Posen. Communities in Poland were often ethnically Polish, although this is not the case of eastern Silesia as the majority of Catholics there were German. During the 19th-century Kulturkampf, Prussian Catholics were forbidden from fulfilling any official functions for the state and were largely distrusted.\nPrussia contained a relatively large Jewish community, which was mostly concentrated in large urban areas. According to the 1880 census, it was the biggest one in Germany with 363,790 individuals.\nIn 1925, 64.9% of the Prussian population was Protestant, 31.3% was Catholic, 1.1% was Jewish, 2.7% was placed in other religious categories.\n### Non-German population\nIn 1871, approximately 2.4 million Poles lived in Prussia, constituting the largest minority. Other minorities were Jews, Danes, Frisians, Dutchmen, Kashubians (72,500 in 1905), Masurians (248,000 in 1905), Lithuanians (101,500 in 1905), Walloons, Czechs, Kursenieki, and Sorbs.\nThe area of Greater Poland, where the Polish nation had originated, became the Province of Posen after the Partitions of Poland. Poles in this Polish-majority province (62% Polish, 38% German) resisted German rule. Also, the southeast portion of Silesia (Upper Silesia) had a Polish majority. But Catholics and Jews did not have equal status with Protestants.\nAs a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, the Second Polish Republic was granted not only these two areas, but also areas with a German majority in the Province of West Prussia. After World War II, East Prussia, Silesia, most of Pomerania and the eastern part of Brandenburg were either annexed by the Soviet Union or given to Poland, and the German-speaking populations forcibly expelled.\nKing Frederick William I of Prussia welcoming the expelled Salzburg Protestants The Berlin Cathedral c. 1900 Prussian deportations (Polenausweisungen) were the mass expulsions of ethnic Poles between 1885 and 1890.\n### Education\nThe German states in the 19th century were world leaders in prestigious education and Prussia set the pace. For boys free public education was widely available, and the gymnasium system for elite students was highly professionalized. The modern university system emerged from the 19th century German universities, especially Friedrich Wilhelm University (now named Humboldt University of Berlin). It pioneered the model of the research university with well-defined career tracks for professors. The United States, for example, paid close attention to German models. Families focused on educating their sons. The traditional schooling for girls was generally provided by mothers and governesses. Elite families increasingly favoured Catholic convent boarding schools for their daughters. Prussia's Kulturkampf laws in the 1870s limited Catholic schools thus providing an opening for a large number of new private schools for girls."], "selected_questions": ["What were the three different areas of Prussia in European history?", "Which king endowed the Prussian state with its military and bureaucratic character?", "When was Prussia officially abolished?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The three different areas of Prussia in European history were:\n\n1) The land of the Prussians on the southeastern coast of the Baltic Sea, which came under Polish and German rule in the Middle Ages.\n2) The kingdom ruled by the German Hohenzollern dynasty from 1701, including Prussia and Brandenburg, with Berlin as its capital.

{"name": "Kings Langley Palace", "documents": ["# Kings Langley Palace\nKings Langley Palace was a 13th-century Royal Palace which was located to the west of the Hertfordshire village of Kings Langley in England. During the Middle Ages, the palace served as a residence of the Plantagenet kings of England. It fell into disuse sometime during the 16th century and became a ruin. Today, nothing remains of the building except for some archaeological remains. The site is a scheduled ancient monument.\n## History\nThe origins of Kings Langley Palace are not known, but it is thought that the estate land was originally the property of the Manor of Chilterne Langley or Langley Chenduit. The estate would have part of a large, dense forest stretching from London out to Berkhamsted which was abundant in deer, and a hunting lodge is known to have existed on the estate during the reign of Henry III. The Manor became a royal possession in 1276 when Queen Eleanor of Castile, wife of King Edward I (\"Edward Longshanks\"), acquired the estate and supervised the development of a lavish royal household. There are records of a \"new start\" in 1277, and these are thought to be either improvements to an existing property or a new house being built at the top of the hill. Little is known about the early development of the palace, but records exist from 1279-1281 which indicate that the palace had private chambers for the Edward I and Eleanor and for their son, Alphonso, Earl of Chester.\nKing's Langley Palace served as a family home for Edward and Eleanor. Their son, Edward of Caernarfon (later King Edward II), who was born in Caernarfon Castle in 1284, spent much of his youth at Langley Palace. Prince Alfonso, heir to the throne, died only months after the young Edward's birth, and Queen Eleanor died unexpectedly in 1290. With Prince Edward now heir to the throne, Langley Palace, was destined to be inherited by the young prince. After Eleanor's death, the King took residence at Ashridge and held Parliament there in 1290 and 1291. In 1299 the aging King Edward I remarried to Margaret of France, granting her Berkhamsted and Hertford Castles, and he returned to Langley. That same year, he summoned the Bishop of Norwich, John Salmon, John of Berkhamsted, Abbot of St Albans, and Aymon, Count of Savoy, to celebrate the feast day of All Saints with him and Queen Margraret at King's Langley.\nAfter Prince Edward was invested as Prince of Wales, King Edward I granted Langley to him in 1302. The young prince was enthusiastic about music, the arts, horse racing and kept a small menagerie, which included a lion and a camel, at Langley. He also allowed his favourite, Piers Gaveston, to live with him at the palace, a companionship which scandalised England at the time. In 1307 Edward II was crowned king and founded the neighbouring King's Langley Priory in 1308 in the park of his manor adjacent to the palace. It was here that King Edward reburied his beloved Gaveston in January 1315 following his execution. Langley Palace remained the King's favourite residence until his death in 1327. Today, no traces of the monastery church or Gaveston's tomb remain.\nDuring the reign of Edward III, his fifth son, Edmund of Langley was born in Langley Palace in 1341 and drew his name from the manor. After his death in 1402, Edmund was buried in the priory there. In the late 1340s, England was being ravaged by the spread of Black Death; with high death rates in London, Edward III moved his Court out of the city to Langley Palace in July 1349, and for a short period the seat of government was based in Kings Langley. Edward also removed his extensive collection of religious relics from the Tower of London and brought them to Kings Langley for safekeeping.\nThe author of The Canterbury Tales, Geoffrey Chaucer, would have visited the palace during his appointment as Clerk of the Kings Works to King Richard II between 1389 and 1391.\nLater King Richard II celebrated Christmas there. The Palace was damaged by a serious fire in 1431; accounts describe \"a great and disastrous fire at the manor of our lady Joan the Queen at Langley\" (referring to Joan of Navarre, wife of Henry IV) which was blamed on \"the negligence and drowsiness of a ministrel and insufficient care of a lighted candle.\" However, records of subsequent repair work to the buildings indicate that the palace was not entirely destroyed by the fire. The last evidence of the Palace being used for official occasions was in 1476 when William Wallingford, Abbot of St Albans Abbey, held a banquet there for the Bishop of Llandaff.\nThe manor was transferred to Eton College but reverted to the Crown, for Henry VIII conveyed it upon Catherine of Aragon, whom he was about to marry. During Henry's reign, a new class of landowner emerged; instead of estates being held by powerful feudal lords who were often a challenge to the sovereign, estates were now being granted to servants of the crown. Holders of high office were granted freehold land as a reward from the king, and they used their new property as a source of income. John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, was given custody of the royal park at Kings Langley in 1538, one of many perquisites he accumulated at the court of Henry VIII. The park was acquired by a wealthy lawyer, Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England and the builder of Old Gorhambury House near St Albans.\nDuring the reign of Charles I, Kings Langley royal park was cleared to make way for agriculture and tenant farmers cultivated the land. By 1652 there were 10 farmers on the estate. In 1626, Charles I granted the Langley Estate to Sir Charles Morrison, owner of the Estate of Cassiobury at nearby Watford who already held a lease on part of the land at Langley. Upon his death in 1628, the estate passed to his daughter, Elizabeth Morrison and her husband Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham. Capell, a Royalist in the English Civil War was executed in 1649, and the estate was granted to a Parliamentarian, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex. Following the Restoration, the Langley Estate was returned by the Crown to the Capell family, granting it to Capell's son Arthur Capell and also creating him Earl of Essex.\nIn the late 17th century the expansion of the London population meant that landowners in the surrounding country were increasingly turning their land to agricultural use, to meet the demand for food and animal feed. Many parks eventually disappeared; Kings Langley Park did not feature on a 1675 map drawn by John Seller.\nThe estate of Langley Palace remained in the possession of the Earls of Essex until 1900, when the 7th Earl, George Capell, sold the land to a Mr. E. N. Loyd of Langleybury.\nRemnants of the Palace complex remained for many years after it ceased to be a royal residence, falling gradually into decay. The gatehouse and parts of the main building were still standing in 1591, and in his 1728 History of Hertfordshire, Nathanael Salmon states that \"Here the rubbish of royalty exists\" in reference to Kings Langley. James Sargant Storer's 1816 account features an illustration of the \"Remains of an Ancient Palace Kings Langley Herts\" which is said to be a farm house which \"exhibits the ancient bake-house and some other vestiges of the domestic offices of the palace.\" A description published by John Murray in 1895 reports that \"at Kings Langley some outer walls only exist of the once royal palace, erected by Henry III.\"\nToday, nothing remains of the royal palace; the site was occupied by the Rudolf Steiner School, which closed in March 2019. A small display case of items from the Palace era recovered during excavation could previously be seen in the school entrance hall. Buildings from King's Langley Priory were also used by the Steiner School. Some ruins exist in the vicinity; ruined flint walls and fragments of stonework remain in the garden of house number 80, Langley Hill, which are thought to be part of a house built for Sir Charles Morrisson around 1580 when he held a lease on the Crown land.\n## Architecture\nThe Palace had a triple courtyard layout. Accounts dating from August 1279 to November 1281, shortly after the estate became a royal possession, describe building work on the house which encompassed construction of chambers for the king and queen and for their son, Alphonso, Earl of Chester, paving the queen's cloister, planting of a vineyard, digging of a well and expansion of a moat. Further records list the construction of a new gateway (1282–83); a wine cellar (1291-92); louvres for the roof of the hall built by a carpenter, Henry of Bovingdon; a stone wall enclosing the court (1296–97); and the addition of new fireplaces in two \"great chambers\". The palace had a bath-house, domestic offices, a bakery, roasting house, great kitchen and \"le Longrewe\" (\"the long house\"). Between 1359 and 1370, further additions were made to the palace, which included a bath house and a new entrance gate at a cost of £3000, and Totternhoe Stone was used to pave the bath house and for a fireplace in the King's chamber.\nIt appears from excavations in 1970 that the Palace also had a huge underground wine cellar, situated under the present-day gymnasium; this cellar is thought to have been built around 1291-92 and was located on the west side of a kitchen court, opposite a bakehouse. Excavations also revealed the presence of a structure to the east of this which is thought to be a probable gatehouse. This gatehouse opened out onto an approach road, now known as Langley Hill. Because the kitchens were located on the west side of the site, it is thought that the great hall of the palace ran on an east-west alignment.\nRecords exists stating that a brickmaker to the king, William Veyse, was appointed in 1437 to produce bricks for Kings Langley Palace. In 1440 bricks from le Frithe, near St Albans, were used to make fireplaces and ovens in the Palace, possibly as part of repair works following the fire of 1431. Veyse was also appointed in 1440 to supply bricks for a stone wall at the Tower of London.\n## In Literature\nAct III, scene IV of William Shakespeare's play Richard II is set in the gardens of Kings Langley Palace, in which Queen Isabel learns of King Richard's imprisonment."], "selected_questions": ["What was the original purpose of Kings Langley Palace during the Middle Ages?", "What happened to Langley Palace after Edward II's death in 1327?", "After the palace went into disuse, what happened to the Langley Estate in the late 17th century?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The original purpose of Kings Langley Palace during the Middle Ages was to serve as a residence for the Plantagenet kings of England.", "After Edward II's death in 1327, Langley Palace remained a royal residence, but it eventually fell into disuse and became a ruin.

{"name": "Oberammergau", "documents": ["# Oberammergau\nOberammergau is a municipality in the district of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, in Bavaria, Germany. The small town on the Ammer River is known for its woodcarvers and woodcarvings, for its NATO School, and around the world for its 380-year tradition of mounting Passion Plays.\n## History\n### Passion Play\nThe Oberammergau Passion Play was first performed in 1634. According to local legend, the play is performed every ten years because of a vow made by the inhabitants of the village that if God spared them from the effects of the bubonic plague then sweeping the region, they would perform a passion play every ten years. A man traveling back to the town for Christmas allegedly brought the plague with him by accident. The man purportedly died from the plague and it began spreading throughout Oberammergau. After the vow was made, according to tradition, not another inhabitant of the town died from the plague. All of the town members that were still suffering from the plague are said to have recovered.\nThe play is now performed in years ending with a zero, as well as in 1934 which was the 300th anniversary and 1984 which was the 350th anniversary (though the 1920 performance was postponed to 1922 due to postwar economic conditions, and the 1940 performance was cancelled due to the onset of the Second World War in 1939). The 2020 play is being postponed to 2022 due to the outbreak of COVID-19. It involves over 2000 actors, singers, instrumentalists and technicians, all residents of the village.\n## Geography\n### Tongue-twister\nThe name of the village (as well as that of neighbouring Unterammergau) appears in a well-known German tongue-twister, often sung as a round:\nGerman: Heut' kommt der Hans zu mir, / freut sich die Lies. / Ob er aber über Oberammergau, / oder aber über Unterammergau, / oder aber überhaupt nicht kommt, / das ist net g'wiß! English: Hans will come join with me, / rejoices Lies. / If he comes by way of Oberammergau / or by way of Unterammergau, / or if at all he comes, / that is not sure!\n## Industry\n### Tourism\nAbout half the inhabitants of Oberammergau took part in the once-a-decade Passion Play in 2010.\nOver 2,000 villagers performed the story of the Passion of Jesus for the audiences from around the world. This was a labor-intensive community enterprise, in which only natives of the village could participate. Performances have taken place between mid-May and early October.\nThe play has a major economic impact on Oberammergau. There is a local expression \"Die Passion zahlt\" (\"The Passion Play will pay for it\") in explaining how the Oberammergau community financed construction of a new community swimming pool, community centre, and other civic improvements. Since 1930, the number of visitors has ranged from 420,000 to 530,000. Most tickets are sold as part of a package with one or two nights' accommodation.\n### Traditional art\nThe village is also known as the home of a long tradition of woodcarving; the Bavarian State Woodcarving School is located there. Among the celebrated former students is the German artist Wolfram Aichele. His processional church staff depicting Christ on a donkey can be seen in the church of St Peter and St Paul. The streets of central Oberammergau are home to dozens of woodcarver shops, with pieces ranging from religious subjects, to toys, to humorous portraits.\nOberammergau is also famous for its \"Lüftlmalerei,\" or frescoes, of traditional Bavarian themes, fairy tales, religious scenes or architectural trompe-l'œil found on many homes and buildings. Lüftlmalerei is common in Upper Bavaria and its name may be derived from an Oberammergau house called Zum Lüftl, which was the home of facade painter Franz Seraph Zwinck (1748–1792).\nThe village is also known for its religious art. A wooden statue of Our Lady of Good Voyage from Oberammergau stands in the Seaport Shrine in Boston, Massachusetts.\n## Transport\nOberammergau lies near the Bundesstraße 23, part of the Deutsche Alpenstrasse route. Its single-track, single platform railway station is the terminus of the Ammergau Railway. Several Aerial lifts climb the nearby mountains.\n## Military\nThe Conrad von Hötzendorf Kaserne was built just east of the village in 1935–37 as a base for the signals detachment (Gebirgs-Nachrichten-Abteilung 54) of the Mountain Brigade. In October 1943, the barracks were taken over by the Messerschmitt company as a research and development site; 37 km (23 mi) of tunnels were bored into the neighboring Laber mountain for engine production facilities, and a winter sports hotel was also taken over. In all, Messerschmitt had 500 employees in the design department and about 1,300 more in the factory. At the end of the Second World War, the Messerschmitt design department was visited by both U.S. and British scientific missions, as well as by teams from Bell (who stayed for five weeks) and de Havilland. Among the German staff interviewed by the Fedden Mission were Woldemar Voigt, Messerschmitt's chief designer, Hans Hornung, and Joseph Helmschrott.\nAfter the war, the Americans occupied the kaserne, renaming it Hawkins Barracks and making it the primary facility of U.S. Army School Europe; over the next three decades schools in specialties ranging from military police to nuclear weapons handling were located there. The base reverted to German Army control and its original name in 1974.\nNATO School, formerly NATO Weapons Systems School, the alliance's principal training and education facility on the operational level, has been located at Hawkins Barracks/Hötzendorf Kaserne since 1953.\n## Gallery\nView of a street in Oberammergau, March 1930 Example of Lüftlmalerei decorating homes in Oberammergau Example of Lüftlmalerei decorating homes in Oberammergau Scene of Little Red Riding Hood decorating a home in Oberammergau Lüftlmalerei adorning the facade of the Pilatushaus The parish church of St. Peter and Paul The stage of the Passionspielhaus (2000) Crucifixion scene from the 1870 Passion Play The Kreuzigungsgruppe Traditional crucifix beside the Pilatushaus Woodcarving of St Florian Nativity group, ca. 1840 Woodcarvings for sale Parish church: Organ gallery Parish church: Dome The Kofel, Oberammergau's signature mountain Oberammergau from the summit of the Kofel The town and the river Ammer in 1900\n## Notable people\nRochus Dedler (1779–1822), composer Johannes Kirchmayer (1860–1930) immigrated to the US in 1880, leading woodcarvers in Boston USA Maximilian Dasio (1865–1954) painter and medal engraver, died in the town.

{"name": "Osmaniye", "documents": ["# Osmaniye\nOsmaniye (pronounced ) is a city on the eastern edge of the Çukurova plain in southern Turkey and the capital of Osmaniye province.\nBacked by the foothills of the Nur Mountains, Osmaniye lay on one of the old Silk Roads and was always a place of strategic importance since it straddled the main route between Anatolia and the Middle East.\nOsmaniye lies at the centre of a rich agricultural region watered by the Ceyhan river and known for growing peanuts. During the intensely hot summers many residents escape either to the Mediterranean coast or into the Nur mountains. The yayla of Zorkun is a particularly popular mountain retreat.\nOsmaniye is strongly associated with Devlet Bahçeli, the leader of the MHP, who was its member of parliament for many years.\n## History\nAlthough Osmaniye was probably inhabited in turn by the Hittites, Persians, Byzantines and Armenians, there is nothing left to show their presence in the modern city.\nAn Islamic presence was first established by the Abbasid Caliph Harun Rashid, auxiliaries in his army being the first Turks to fight in Anatolia. They obviously liked the area and following the Turkish victory over the Byzantines at Malazgirt in 1071 waves of Turkish conquest began. The Nur Mountains were settled by the Ulaşlı tribe of the Turkmens.\nThe Ulaşlı remained the dominant local power into the period of the Ottoman Empire and were even involved in the Celali uprisings, during a period of crisis for the Ottomans in the 17th century. Eventually, in 1865 the Ottoman general Derviş Paşa was charged with bringing law and order to the Çukurova. He established his headquarters in the Osmaniye villages of Dereobası, Fakıuşağı and Akyar and brought the Ulaşlı down from the mountains to the village of Hacıosmanlı. This eventually became the province of Osmaniye.\nBetween 1924 and 1933 the city of Osmaniye was the capital of the province of the same name. However, in 1933 the province was abolished and Osmaniye became the district governorate for Adana province. Then in 1996 Osmaniye was reinstated as Turkey's 80th province with the city of Osmaniye as its capital. Since then it has received more investment for infrastructure and now feels more like a city than the market town of old.\n## Local attractions\nOsmaniye town has few attractions for visitors other than the city-centre Kent Müzesi (City Museum). However, it makes a good base for visiting the scant remains of the nearby Roman city of Hierapolis-Castabala which huddles at the base of a craggy rock with a castle, probably built by the Armenians, perched on top of it.\n## Climate\nOsmaniye has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa, Trewartha: Cs) with very hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters."], "selected_questions": ["Where is Osmaniye located in Turkey?", "What is the main agricultural product in the region of Osmaniye?", "What type of climate does Osmaniye experience?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Osmaniye is located on the eastern edge of the Çukurova plain in southern Turkey.", "The main agricultural product in the region of Osmaniye is peanuts.", "Osmaniye experiences a Mediterranean climate, with very hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters."], "InternLM_answers": ["Osmaniye is located in the southern part of Turkey, near the border with Syria.

{"name": "Wilberforce Colony", "documents": ["# Wilberforce Colony\nWilberforce Colony was a colony established in the year 1829 by free African American citizens, north of present-day London, Ontario, Canada. It was an effort by American Blacks to create a place where they could live in political freedom.\nWhen American Black communities favoured emigration (and many did not), they preferred going to a country where free Blacks could hold full political control over their destiny. The establishment of what became the Wilberforce Colony in Canada was one such movement. It was planned by Black Americans from Cincinnati, Ohio who emigrated following passage of discriminatory laws in the year 1828 and a destructive riot against them by White Americans in 1829.\nThe frontier colony grew quickly upon its founding. Refugee slaves, who had escaped to freedom in Canada, also joined the colony. Internal disputes, lack of funding, and the draw of urban jobs led to its decline by 1850. In the 1840s, many Irish immigrants settled in this area after fleeing famine in their homeland. Altogether, the Wilberforce Colony survived as an independent community fewer than 20 years.\n## Background\nThe increase in Cincinnati's Black population in the decade starting in 1820 was rapid and pronounced. Although Ohio was a free state, the southern portion was influenced by settlers from the south and racial tensions grew. In 1820, some 433 African Americans comprised less than 4% of the city's population, but over the next decade the city's Black population swelled by more than 400%. This change alarmed some White residents. In response to a citizens' petition in 1828, the Cincinnati City Council appointed a committee, \"to take measures to prevent the increase of  population within the city.\" In March of that year, the Ohio Supreme Court decided that the 1807 state Black Laws, which placed restrictions on Black people in many areas of life and employment, were constitutional. The Cincinnati City Council enforced this restrictive legislation.\n## Purchase of land in Canada\nNear the end of June 1828, the Black population of Cincinnati elected Israel Lewis and Thomas Crissup to survey a site in Canada to which they could emigrate. Lewis and Crissup met with John Colbourne, the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, to discuss prospects of settling in the area. They entered into a contract with the Canada Company for the purchase of land in Biddulph in the Huron Tract in Ontario, lots 2, 3, and 5 north of the Proof Line Road and lot 11 south of the road, for the amount of $1.50 per acre. The land was on the Ausable River, some twenty miles (32 km) from Lake Huron, and about thirty-five miles from the northern shore of Lake Erie. The initial arrangement between Israel Lewis and Thomas Crissup envisaged the purchase of 4,000 acres (16 km2) for $6,000, to be paid by November 1830.\n## Emigration from Cincinnati\nThe Cincinnati riots of 1829 broke out at the start of July and continued to the end of August, as a result of white people attacking Black people. There was an exodus of around 1,000 Black individuals from Cincinnati.\nThose who left the city that summer comprised two groups. Those who were primarily forced out of Cincinnati by violence, fear, and inability to work generally settled in nearby towns or villages. The second group organized as an exodus, with many emigrating the full distance of nearly 400 miles to the Canadian site. Since settling in the still-unnamed Wilberforce Colony required purchase of land, however, those without financial resources simply stopped in the United States, settling in towns on the southern shore of Lake Erie where they could find work. They never made it to Canada.\nThose who did make it to Canada had to travel some thirty-five miles northward from Lake Erie through untracked forest. At the site, they had to clear land for crops and to build dwellings. Although exact figures are not known, evidence suggests that of the initial exodus, only five or six families made it to the Ontario colony in the first year.\n## Settlement and naming the colony\nThe initial arrangement between the Canada Company and Lewis and Crissup called for a $6,000 payment by November 1830. But the number of colonists expected to support that purchase could not be immediately achieved, and the financial resources of the initial colonists could not support that arrangement. Financial stability for the colony was precarious for that first year.\nThey appealed to other sources for additional support, with efforts to raise monies in Cincinnati and pleas to the Ohio state legislature made in vain. But an appeal to the Quakers (mostly based in Oberlin, Ohio) was successful. On September 20, 1830, James Brown, former US Minister of France and US Senator from Louisiana, and Stephen Duncan, an extremely wealthy planter and slaveholder from Pennsylvania and Mississippi, purchased 400 acres (1.6 km2) for the settlement.\nWith the land secured, the colonists turned to clearing land and building structures. In 1831, the settlement was named, \"Wilberforce,\" in honour of William Wilberforce, the prominent British abolitionist. Leading the fight against the British slave trade, he helped gain passage of the 1807 Act that abolished the slave trade throughout the British Empire. (The institution of slavery itself would not be abolished in the British empire until August 1833, effective in 1834.)\n## Growth of the colony\nThe initial group of emigrants tended to be Black individuals from the more educated class of Cincinnati. The education for their children was of great importance. They were building on a tradition formed in Cincinnati, where the community placed great importance on education. The first institution established in Wilberforce was a school. American social reformer William Lloyd Garrison visited the colony in 1831 and noted that 20-30 children attended schools. By 1832, they had established three schools, and their quality attracted students from the surrounding White population. Aspirations for education extended beyond elementary and secondary schools.\nThe desire of the Wilberforce colonists was for more than mere literacy. Also by 1832, the settlement had crops in the ground and log homes. Settlers built three sawmills: one powered by water, a gristmill, and several general stores. The proximity of the settlement to the Ausable River gave transportation access to goods, and provided a way to export products, both agricultural and forest-related.\nThe riots in Cincinnati, and the establishment of Wilberforce Colony, helped raise a national Black consciousness. Interest grew in emigration from other northern cities. The Mother Bethel Church in Philadelphia assembled Black leaders from across the north to search for solutions to empower all African Americans. In an 1830 national convention, the assembly organized itself as the American Society of Free Persons of Color (ASFPC), the beginning of the Black convention movement. Impetus began at the first annual convention of the ASFPC, with the proposal to establish a manual labor college for young men in New Haven, Connecticut. When this seemed impossible, the convention turned to Wilberforce. A national subscription campaign in the United States and Great Britain, under the direction of Nathaniel Paul, was attempted. The subscription drive failed, but the importance of higher education to the Wilberforce colonists was clearly demonstrated.\nWithin the first 18 months, as Wilberforce grew from the initial few families, other Black American emigrants joined them from Boston, Rochester, Albany, New York, Baltimore, and other cities. Subsequent recruiting efforts drew Black people and their families from other northern cities, and by 1832 there were 32 families in the area. By 1835, the community had 166 inhabitants. Eventually about 150-200 families settled there.\nWith this infusion of African Americans from several cities, political growth began. A board of managers was created, primarily to oversee financial matters. Austin Steward, an abolitionist recently arrived from Rochester, New York, was named president. He and other newcomers replaced the old Cincinnati leaders, in 1831 relegating Israel Lewis, original colony organizer and land agent, to U.S. fundraising agent. He was one of two fundraising agents appointed, the other being Nathaniel Paul in England.\n## Decline and dissolution\nThe schism between the original Cincinnati families and new settlers eventually led to the decline of the colony. The Cincinnati leaders came from city life and did not adapt well to the harsh farming environment. Within that first decade, many of the leaders of the emigration movement who had located in Wilberforce, left the community. In addition, both fundraising agents failed to live up to expectations. By 1839, suspicions of wrongdoing, particularly by Lewis, exacerbated the problems of Wilberforce. According to a historian of the area:\nNathaniel Paul, who was sent to England to solicit funds, returned with over $7000 in collections, but his expenses totaled over $8000, leaving the Colony with a substantial debt. The efforts of the second agent, Israel Lewis, were even more damaging. Lewis spent over 10 years collecting funds throughout the United States and Canada, but obstinately refused to turn over any money to the Board of Managers. Angry and frustrated, the Board of Managers were forced to publish notices in several newspapers warning contributors not to donate any money to Lewis. The bad publicity that resulted seriously damaged the Colony's reputation, and long-time supporters, including abolitionists and the Quakers of Ohio and Indiana, began to withdraw their support.\nBy the late 1840s, the Irish began moving into the area as part of a wave of immigration resulting from widespread famine in Ireland. The Black population declined greatly, with many of the original colonists moving on to larger, growing urban centres such as Detroit, Cleveland, or Toronto to obtain wage-based employment. Eventually, the Irish community supplanted Wilberforce altogether, and the town of Lucan was incorporated. Wilberforce as a free Black colony faded into history.\nA small number of Black families stayed on to work the land through subsequent generations. But, by the end of the 20th century, only the family of settler Peter Butler still had descendants in the area of the Wilberforce Colony village.\n## Chronology\n1828\nJune — Cincinnati Black population elects Israel Lewis and Thomas Crissup to survey a site in Canada to which they can emigrate. July — Lewis and Crissup met with John Colbourne, Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, to discuss prospects of settling in the area. They enter into a contract with the Canada Company for the purchase of land in Biddulph in the Huron Tract in Ontario, lots 2, 3, and 5 north of the Proof Line Road and lot 11 south of the road.\n1829\nJuly–August — Cincinnati riots of 1829 force more than 1,000 African-Americans to leave the city. A group of these set out for the settlement. September — First wave of settlers, probably only five or six families, arrive in the area.\n1830\nSeptember 20 — James Brown and Stephen Duncan purchased 400 acres (1.6 km2) for the establishment of the colony.\n1831\nSettlement named \"Wilberforce\" in honour of William Wilberforce. Emigrants from Boston, Rochester, Albany, New York, Baltimore, and other cities join the settlement. William Lloyd Garrison visits the colony, noting that 20-30 children attend schools. Board of managers created, with Austin Steward named president. Original colony organizer Israel Lewis is appointed as the local fundraising agent; Nathaniel Paul named fundraising agent for Great Britain.\n1832\nWilberforce has 32 families, with crops in the ground and log homes. The colony has three sawmills, a gristmill, and several general stores. Three schools established, drawing students from the surrounding white population.\n1835\nWilberforce population hits 166 inhabitants.\n1836\nLewis accused of mismanaging fundraising accounts.\n1840\nMost of the original Cincinnati settlers have left.\n1850\nBlack population in the area declines in the face of Irish immigration; the colony effectively dissolves."], "selected_questions": ["How did the Cincinnati riots of 1829 impact the emigration of Black individuals from Cincinnati?", "Who purchased the land for the establishment of Wilberforce Colony?", "What were some of the economic activities present in Wilberforce Colony?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The Cincinnati riots of 1829 had a significant impact on the emigration of Black individuals from Cincinnati.

The land was once the city of Forum Clodii, and is designated as an area of outstanding natural beauty. It is named after the Romanesque church founded on this site by the Augustinian Monks.\n## History\nThe region was important for the Etruscans, with Tarquinia, Cerveteri, Tuscania and Blera are all within a few miles of the San Liberato estate. Later, this southern part of Etruria was taken over by the expanding Romans, who founded Sabate in cc. 273 BC, giving the name Lacus Sabatinus to what is now Lake Bracciano. The Romanesque church of San Liberato, surrounded by the botanic gardens of the rural estate by the same name, was erected in the 9th century.

{"name": "Flemish", "documents": ["# Flemish\nFlemish (Vlaams) is a Low Franconian dialect cluster of the Dutch language. It is sometimes referred to as Flemish Dutch (Vlaams-Nederlands), Belgian Dutch (Belgisch-Nederlands  (listen)), or Southern Dutch (Zuid-Nederlands). Flemish is native to Flanders, a historical region in northern Belgium; it is spoken by Flemings, the dominant ethnic group of the region. Outside of Flanders, it is also spoken to some extent in French Flanders and the Dutch Zeelandic Flanders.\n## Terminology\nThe term Flemish itself has become ambiguous. Nowadays, it is used in at least five ways, depending on the context. These include:\nAn indication of Dutch written and spoken in Flanders including the Dutch standard language as well as the non-standardized dialects, including intermediate forms between vernacular dialects and the standard. Some linguists avoid the term Flemish in this context and prefer the designation Belgian-Dutch or South-Dutch Further information: Dutch in Belgium A synonym for the so-called intermediate language in Flanders region, the Tussentaal An indication of the non-standardized dialects and regiolects of Flanders region An indication of the non-standardized dialects of only the former County of Flanders, i.e. the current provinces of West Flanders and East Flanders, Zeelandic Flanders and French Flanders An indication of the non-standardized West Flemish dialects of the province of West Flanders, the Dutch Zeelandic Flanders and French Frans-Vlaanderen Further information: West Flemish\nMultiTree considers Flemish to include the four principal Dutch dialects in the Flemish region (Flanders): Brabantian, East Flemish, West Flemish and Limburgish as well as three other dialects. Glottolog considers Western Flemish to be a separate language, classified as a part of the Southwestern Dutch family together with the Zeelandic language. According to Glottolog, Western Flemish includes the dialects of French Flemish and West Flemish. Brabantian and East Flemish are classified as Dutch dialects, under the Central Southern Dutch dialect group. Ethnologue considers Limburgish and West Flemish to be separate (regional) languages.\n## Characteristics\nDutch is the majority language in northern Belgium, being used in written language by three-fifths of the population of Belgium. It is one of the three national languages of Belgium, together with French and German, and is the only official language of the Flemish Region.\nThe various Dutch dialects spoken in Belgium contain a number of lexical and a good amount of grammatical features that distinguish them from the standard Dutch. Basic Dutch words can have a completely different meaning in Flemish or imply different context. As in the Netherlands, the pronunciation of Standard Dutch is affected by the native dialect of the speaker.\nAll Dutch dialect groups spoken in Belgium are spoken in adjacent areas of the Netherlands as well. East Flemish forms a continuum with both Brabantic and West Flemish. Standard Dutch is primarily based on the Hollandic dialect  (spoken in the Western provinces of the Netherlands) and to a lesser extent on Brabantian, which is the dominant dialect in Flanders, as well as in the south of the Netherlands.\n### Tussentaal\nThe supra-regional, semi-standardized colloquial form (mesolect) of Dutch spoken in Belgium uses the vocabulary and the sound inventory of the Brabantic dialects. It is often called an \"in-between-language\" or \"intermediate language\", intermediate between dialects and standard Dutch. Despite its name, Brabantian is the dominant contributor to the Flemish Dutch tussentaal.\nIt is a rather informal variety of speech, which occupies an intermediate position between vernacular dialects and the standard language. It incorporates phonetic, lexical and grammatical elements not part of the standard language but drawn from local dialects.\nIt is a relatively new phenomenon that has been gaining popularity during the past decades. Some linguists note that it seems to be undergoing a process of (limited) standardisation or that it is evolving into a koiné variety.\nTussentaal is slowly gaining popularity in Flanders because it is used a lot in television dramas and comedies. Often, middle-class characters in a television series will be speaking tussentaal, lower-class characters use the dialect of the location where the show is set (such as Western Flanders), and upper-class characters will speak Standard Dutch. That has given tussentaal the status of normalcy in Flanders. It is slowly being accepted by the general population, but it has met with objections from writers and academics who argue that it dilutes the usage of Standard Dutch. Tussentaal is used in entertainment television but rarely in informative programmes (like the news), which normally use Flemish accents with standard Dutch vocabulary.\n### Belgicisms\nA belgicism is a word or expression that occurs only in the Belgian variant of Dutch. Some are rarely used, others are used daily and are considered part of the Belgian-Dutch standard language. Many belgicisms are loanwords and words or expressions literally translated from French (also called gallicisms); others, in response, are actually remarkably purist, such as droogzwierder (a compound of Dutch droog \"dry\" and zwierder \"spinner\") meaning \"spin dryer\" (common standard Dutch: centrifuge, a loanword from French), and duimspijker (a compound of Dutch duim \"thumb\" and spijker \"nail\") meaning \"thumbtack\" (common standard Dutch: punaise, a loanword from French). Among the belgicisms, there are also many words that are considered obsolete, formal, or purist in standard Dutch. Moreover, many belgicisms have their origin in the Belgian official nomenclature. For example, misdaad \"felony\" is not a legal term in the Netherlands, but it is in Belgium.\n## Etymology\nThe English adjective Flemish (first attested as flemmysshe, c. 1325; compare Flæming, c. 1150), meaning \"from Flanders\", was probably borrowed from Old Frisian. The Old Dutch form is flāmisk, which becomes vlamesc, vlaemsch in Middle Dutch and Vlaams in Modern Dutch.\nThe word Vlaams itself is derived from flâm, an Ingvaeonic derivation from the Germanic word flaumaz, meaning 'stream; current', (a cognate to English fleam (dialectal) and German Flaum (dialectal)). The name Vlaanderen was formed from a stem flâm-, with a suffix -ðr- attached."], "selected_questions": ["How does Standard Dutch differ from the Dutch dialects spoken in Belgium?", "What is Tussentaal and how is it used in Flanders?", "What are Belgicisms and how are they used in the Belgian variant of Dutch?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Standard Dutch differs from the Dutch dialects spoken in Belgium in several ways.

It is also the language used in education, media, and government.\n\nIn contrast, the Dutch dialects spoken in Belgium are influenced by the surrounding languages, including French and German. The dialects are also more diverse, with each region having its own unique dialect.

Belgian dialects tend to have a more guttural sound, with a heavier emphasis on the \"g\" and \"ch\" sounds. Standard Dutch, on the other hand, has a more even and fluid pronunciation.\n\nAnother difference is in the vocabulary. Belgian dialects often use words and phrases that are not commonly used in Standard Dutch.

{"name": "Wagoner, Oklahoma", "documents": ["# Wagoner, Oklahoma\nWagoner is a city in Wagoner County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 8,323 at the 2010 census, compared to the figure of 7,669 recorded in 2000. It is the county seat of Wagoner County. Wagoner became the first city incorporated in Indian Territory on January 4, 1896.\n## History\nWagoner is along the path of the Texas Road cattle trail, and the later Jefferson Highway of the early National Trail System, both roughly along the route of U.S. Route 69 through Oklahoma today. The town began as a small community at the intersection of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas (MKT) Railway and the Kansas and Arkansas Valley Railway (later the Missouri Pacific Railway), when William McAnally, a foreman for the MKT built a small hotel at this isolated location in June 1887. By the next summer others had built two more hotels and two general stores. The town was named for railroad dispatcher Henry \"Big Foot\" Wagoner, who had reported the need for a railroad switch nearby to accommodate the shipment of logs and hay. The switch had been previously named \"Wagoner's Switch.\" The switch soon relocated to the town and caused the development of a major cattle shipping business.\nBy 1894, the community had 642 names in a local census. A local newspaper began promoting the town in 1895, encouraging more people to move to there. By 1896, there were approximately 1,500 residents. In the fall of 1895, the community formed a commission that circulated a petition requesting incorporation under the statutes of Arkansas. Incorporation was granted by the U. S. District Court on January 4, 1896, making Wagoner the first city incorporated in Indian Territory.\nA privately funded courthouse was built in 1897, which housed a newly created U. S. Western District Court. The Dawes Commission turned Indian Territory land from tribal to individual ownership by members of each tribe. The individuals were allowed to sell their land to non-Indians, causing a real estate boom in farmland around the area. By statehood, the city had 2,950 residents and was named as the county seat of Wagoner County.\nIn April 1914 Wagoner was the location of a brutal lynching of a 17 year old African American girl.\nThe boom continued through 1910, when the population reached 4,018. The MKT had located a division headquarters in the city, which then had three railroad trunk lines and twenty passenger trains a day. Industries included three grain elevators, a cotton gin, cotton oil mill, iron foundry, hardwood company, cement plant, and roller mill. However, the boom ended in 1913, when the MKT moved its division headquarters to Muskogee. The oil boom farther west and later, the Great Depression, caused a further decline in the city's economy and population.\nWorld War II started a revival of Wagoner's fortunes. The city lay between two war-related Federal Government projects: Camp Gruber to the south and the Oklahoma Ordnance Works to the north.\nAfter the war, several small manufacturing industries took root. Completion of the nearby Fort Gibson Lake in 1950 stimulated the economy and turned Wagoner into a sports and retirement center. The McLellan-Kerr navigational channel made the agricultural area accessible by barges, stimulating farm-related businesses. Highway improvements made Wagoner a bedroom community for Tulsa and Muskogee.\n## Geography\nWagoner is located at 35°57′20″N 95°22′41″W﻿ / ﻿35.95556°N 95.37806°W﻿ / 35.95556; -95.37806 (35.955501, -95.377938).

On Tuesday, April 21, 2015, The Tulsa World announced that its parent company BH Media, a division of Berkshire Hathaway, the Omaha-based investment holding company led by billionaire Warren Buffett had purchased several suburban newspapers, including the Wagoner Tribune.\n## Government\nWagoner uses a city council consisting of eight members and the mayor. As of April 2020, the current mayor is Albert Jones.\n## Transportation\n### Highways\nWagoner is served by US-69, SH-51, and SH-16, and has easy access to the Muskogee Turnpike, also known as SH-351, providing a direct route to Tulsa.\n### Airports\nHefner-Easley Airport (FAA Identifier—H68), owned by the City of Wagoner, is two miles directly east. Commercial flights go in and out of Tulsa International Airport, about a 45-minute drive to the northwest.\n### Railroads\nThe town has freight service from the Union Pacific, being at the intersection of the old Katy and Missouri Pacific lines now both owned by Union Pacific. Union Pacific honors Wagoner as a “Train Town USA,” one of 131 communities out of 7,300 communities it serves, because of the town's unique, long-standing relationship with the railroad.\n## Notable people\nBob Bogle (1934-2009), a founding member of The Ventures Isabel Cobb (1858-1947), first woman physician in Indian territory.

{"name": "Bergpark Wilhelmshöhe", "documents": ["# Bergpark Wilhelmshöhe\nBergpark Wilhelmshöhe is a landscape park in Kassel, Germany. The area of the park is 2.4 square kilometres (590 acres), making it the largest European hillside park, and second largest park on a hill slope in the world. Construction of the Bergpark, or \"mountain park\", began in 1689 at the behest of the Landgraves of Hesse-Kassel and took about 150 years. The park is open to the public today. Since 2013, it has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its monumental Baroque architecture and its unique fountains and water features.\n## Geography\n### Location\nBad Wilhelmshöhe , a Stadtteil of Kassel in northern Hesse, is situated west of the city centre at the foot of the Habichtswald hill range. It is also known for Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe station on the Hanover–Würzburg high-speed railway line.\n## Description\nThe park comprises an area of about 2.4 square kilometres (0.93 sq mi), stretching from Kassel up to the Karlsberg mountain at 526.2 metres (1,726 ft). At the summit of the park stands the Hercules monument, a 40-meter high pyramid with a 8.5-meter bronze statue of Hercules. Behind the monument, a series of reservoirs gather water, which passes through a complex series of channels, valves, aqueducts, and water-wheels as it flows from the monument down through the park. The water tumbles through a Baroque water theatre, grotto, fountains, two hydraulic organs and several waterfalls (including a Great Cascade that is 350 meters long) before arriving at the pond, with the Great Fountain. At about 50 meters (160 ft) high, the Great Fountain was the largest fountain in Europe at the time of its creation in 1767. Below the pond and Great Fountain, the water runs in to ponds and pools at the Wilhelmshöhe Palace, built for the Elector of Hesse William I in the late 18th century.\n### Hercules\nThe Kassel Hercules is a copper statue depicting the ancient Greek demigod Heracles (Gr. Ηρακλής, German Herkules). It is a copy of the third century Farnese Hercules statue, created by Johann Jacob Anthoni, a goldsmith from Augsburg.\n## History\nOriginally laid out in the Baroque style of the giardino all'italiana and the French formal garden, with water features running downhill in cascades to Schloss Wilhelmshöhe, it was later re-arranged into an English landscape garden.\nIn 1143, Canons Regular from Mainz established the Weißenstein monastery at the site of present-day Schloss Wilhelmshöhe, which was dissolved in the course of the Protestant Reformation. Landgrave Philip I of Hesse used the remaining buildings as a hunting lodge, largely rebuilt by his descendant Maurice of Hesse-Kassel from 1606 to 1610.\n### 1696–1806\nThe Bergpark came into being as a Baroque park under Landgrave Charles I of Hesse-Kassel. In 1701, the Italian architect Giovanni Francesco Guerniero  started the construction of the Hercules monument and the giant cascades. In 1785, Wilhelm (William) IX, Landgrave of Hesse started a large extension of the park, and the following year his architect, Simon Louis du Ry, designed the Neoclassical palace Schloss Wilhelmshöhe.\nMeanwhile, the ideals of the landscaping changed from the French Baroque to the English garden. In the course of the extension and modifications, Heinrich Christoph Jussow , apart from contributing to the design of the palace, created constructions still characterizing the park today: artificial ruins like the Löwenburg  (Lion's Castle) and the Roman aqueduct, as well as extensions of the water garden like the Lac, the fountain pond, and the Teufelsbrücke (Devil's Bridge) with the Höllenteich (Hell's Pond). In 1793, Karl Steinhöfer added the Steinhöfer Waterfall to the water garden.\n### 1806–1866\nKassel became the capital of the newly created Kingdom of Westphalia, a vassal state of France, ruled by Napoleon's brother Jérôme Bonaparte. He kept court at the palace of Wilhelmshöhe (which was renamed Napoleonshöhe) until 1813, after Napoleon's defeat and the restoration of the electorate. The king's Head Chamberlain and governor of Napoleonshöhe was Count Heinrich von Blumenthal. In 1826, William II, Elector of Hesse ordered the last large construction of the Bergpark Wilhelmshöhe, the grosser Wasserfall (Great Waterfall).\n### 1866–1918\nHaving sided with Austria in the Austro-Prussian War for supremacy in Germany, the principality was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1866. The Prussian administration united Nassau, Frankfurt and Hesse-Kassel into the new Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau. Kassel ceased to be a princely residence, the dynasty of the creators of the park ended.\nIn 1870, after the Battle of Sedan, French Emperor Napoleon III was sent as a prisoner to Schloss Wilhelmshöhe before going into exile in Britain. From 1899, German Emperor Wilhelm II, who went to school in Kassel, chose Wilhelmshöhe as his summer residence, which turned the castle and the park into a centre of European politics for the next two decades. After the armistice which ended World War I, the Oberste Heeresleitung led by Paul von Hindenburg organized and led the withdrawal and demobilization of the German troops from here from November 1918 to February 1919.\n### 20th and 21st century\nSchloss Wilhelmshöhe was damaged by Allied bombs in World War II. From 1968 to 1974, it was rebuilt as an art museum. It houses a wallpaper collection, a collection of Graeco-Roman antiques, and a gallery of Old Masters paintings. The collection focuses on the 16th and 17th century, containing masterpieces by German, Italian, French and Spanish painters. It comprises the second-largest collection of Rembrandts in Germany. Rembrandt's famous \"Saskia\" and \"The Man with the Slouch Hat\" by Frans Hals are among them.\nIn 1972, the Chancellor of West Germany Willy Brandt and the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic Willi Stoph met in Schloss Wilhelmshöhe for negotiations between the two German states.\nNo extensions were made to the Park in the 20th century. Extensive renovations to the Hercules monument and cascades have been ongoing in the 21st century, and are still in progress; much of the monument continues to be shrouded in scaffolding.\n## Today\nBergpark Wilhelmshöhe is administrated by the State of Hesse and affiliated with the European Garden Heritage Network since 2009. On 23 June 2013 it was proclaimed as a World Heritage Site during the UNESCO meeting in Phnom Penh. It is part of the Museumslandschaft Hessen Kassel.\n## Evaluation\nArt historian Georg Dehio (1850–1932), inspirator of the modern discipline of historic preservation, described the park as \"possibly the most grandiose combination of landscape and architecture that the Baroque dared anywhere\" (\"vielleicht das Grandioseste, was irgendwo der Barock in Verbindung von Architektur und Landschaft gewagt hat.\").\n## Literature\nGiovanni Francesco Guerniero, Delineatio Montis, Cassel 1706 Paul Heidelbach, Die Geschichte der Wilhelmshöhe.

{"name": "Sierra, Abangares", "documents": ["# Sierra, Abangares\nSierra, locally known as Las Minas (The Mines), is a district of the Abangares canton, in the Guanacaste province of Costa Rica. It is well known as a historical mining town of Costa Rica, located in the north west Pacific Region. It goes from an altitude of 210 meters to 1200 meters.\n## History and mining\nOral history tells that the name \"Sierra\" is related to one of the first resources the town took advantage of: wood. The Spanish word \"sierra\" means \"saw.\" Residents developed sawmills once they knew about the valuable and precious woods in the area.\nBy the year 1900, the gold mining industry had started up in Abangares but mostly in Sierra, were the Abangares Gold Fields of Costa Rica (Abangares Mining Company) owned by Minor C. Keith, built up the Stamp mill House, the Company Headquarters and the Powder House. The ore activity carried vast development. By that time, people compared La Sierra development with California (as well because the Gold rush).\n## Climate\nIt is a mountainous zone with a variety of temperatures (from 34 °C to 5 °C) and climates (from dry forest to rain forest).\n## Geography\nSierra has an area of 112.01 km2 and an elevation of 270 metres.\nTo the north it borders Tilarán, to the south San Juan de Abangares and Las Juntas (south west), to the east Monteverde and to the west it borders Cañas.\n## Economy\nThe major activities are agriculture (Coffee and variety of Vegetable), Gold mining and Tourism. At the moment, gold mining is artisanal and largely unregulated.\nAgriculture and mining are the most traditional activities and ways of living in the district. All over the highlands (San Rafael, Cebadilla, Campos de Oro, Cañitas, La Cruz and Tornos) small producers of coffee and vegetables are organized in cooperatives.\nThe Ecomuseum, the biodiversity, and the hot springs are attracting tourism from all over the world to the district. La Sierra is between Guanacaste and San José, and between Guanacaste and Monteverde. Tourism can include staying in La Sierra and using a non traditional tourist route to Guanacaste, with local options including zip lining, agritourism, visiting the Ecomuseum, seeking out local gold miners, or resting at the hot springs.\n### Mining ecomuseum\nThe Mining ecomuseum is located on 38 hectares of local government property and managed by the district Committee of Culture and Management of Museums. It documents and celebrates one of the first mining centers in Central America, and the legends and realities that the miners of the time lived in. The recent built showroom displays graphic and documentary information. Various paths explain the mining infrastructure, which preserves the spirit of the mining years (1901–1931).\nThe “Ecomuseum” idea arose in France in the 1970s. In Costa Rica it was adopted in the 1980s. The Abarenges Mine Ecomuseum was founded in 1991. It's an educational model of culture and sustainable development that integrates inhabitants with rational resource use, and ecological protection and cultural protection.\nThe Eco-museum was developed around the ruins of one of the oldest gold mines in the region, where old machinery, hand tools, and infrastructure can still be seen. The surrounding area is largely forested and provides opportunities for bird and butterfly watching, and other nature observation. It is a community organization that conserves and transmits local history, and strengthens the identity of the towns. In 2001, it was declared a Historical Architectonic Patrimony.\nThe Ecomuseum is in an area that holds evidence of the biggest scale of gold mining in Costa Rica, where the Company “Abangares Gold Fields of Costa Rica” operated. It contains an outdoor exhibition of mining machinery, paths that lead to the ruins of an old stamp mill house, “Edificio de los Mazos,” “Casa de la Pólvora,” and great natural scenery. There is a Tunnel on a historical traverse, where Tulita, a steam locomotive, pulled ore wagons.\n## Villages\nSierra is composed of fifteen villages:\nAguas Claras Alto Cebadilla Campos de Oro Candelaria Cañitas Cruz Cuesta Yugo Dos de Abangares La Sierra Marsellesa San Antonio San Rafael Tornos Tres Amigos Turín (part)\n## Demographics\nFor the 2011 census, Sierra had a population of 2,351.\n## Transportation\n### Road transportation\nThe district is covered by the following road routes:\nNational Route 145 National Route 606"], "selected_questions": ["What was the main resource that Sierra took advantage of in its early days?", "Who owned the Abangares Gold Fields of Costa Rica?", "When was the Abarenges Mine Ecomuseum founded?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["In its early days, Sierra took advantage of wood as its main resource.", "The Abangares Gold Fields of Costa Rica were owned by Minor C.

{"name": "Aizanoi", "documents": ["# Aizanoi\nAizanoi (Ancient Greek: Αἰζανοί), Latinized as Aezani, was a Phrygian city in western Anatolia. Located in what is now Çavdarhisar, near Kütahya, its ruins are situated astride the River Penkalas, some 1,000 m (3,300 ft) above sea level. The city was an important political and economic centre in Roman times; surviving remains from the period include a well-preserved Temple of Zeus, unusual combined theatre-stadium complex, and macellum inscribed with the Price Edict of Diocletian. The city fell into decline in Late Antiquity. Later serving as a citadel, in 2012 the site was submitted for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n## History\nSettlement in the area is known from the Bronze Age. The city may have derived its name from Azan, one of three sons of Arcas and the nymph Erato, legendary ancestors of the Phrygians. During the Hellenistic period the city changed hands between the Kingdom of Pergamum and the Kingdom of Bithynia, before being bequeathed to Rome by the former in 133 BC. It continued to mint its own coins. Its monumental buildings date from the early Empire to the 3rd century.\nAezani was part of the Roman province of Phrygia Pacatiana. It became a Christian bishopric at an early stage, and its bishop Pisticus (or Pistus) was a participant at the First Council of Nicaea, the first ecumenical council, in 325. Bishop Pelagius was at a synod that Patriarch John II of Constantinople hastily organized in 518 and that condemned Severus of Antioch; he was also at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553. Bishop Gregory was at the Trullan Council of 692, John at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, and Theophanes at both the Council of Constantinople (869) and the Council of Constantinople (879). The bishopric was at first a suffragan of Laodicea but, when Phrygia Pacatiana was divided into two provinces, it found itself a suffragan of Hierapolis, the capital of the new province of Phrygia Pacatiana II. No longer a residential bishopric, Aezani is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\nAfter the 7th century, Aezani fell into decline. Later, in Seljuk times, the temple hill was converted into a citadel (Turkish: hisar) by Çavdar Tatars, after which the recent settlement of Çavdarhisar is named. The ruins of Aezani/Aizanoi were noted by European travellers in 1824. Survey work in the 1830s and 1840s was followed by systematic excavation conducted by the German Archaeological Institute from 1926, resumed in 1970, and still ongoing.\nIn January 2021, archaeologists led by Dr. Elif Özer from Pamukkale University announced that they had discovered a cache containing 651 Roman coins dated about 2,100 years ago in a jug buried near a stream. Researchers revealed a jug firstly in 2019. 439 pieces of coins were denarius (ancient Roman coins minted on silver), and 212 were cistophori, silver coins from Pergamum. Caesar, Brutus, Mark Antony and (young) Augustus are engraved on the mostly well-preserved coins. The find is going on display in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations.\nIn August 2021, archaeologists from Dumlupinar University announced the discovery of a statue of Hygieia. The human-sized statue is portrayed with a snake in its arms. The statue was revealed inside the columned gallery which runs throughout the south wing of the agora.\nIn December 2021, archaeologists discovered a marble statue of Heracles.\n## Ancient buildings and structures\n### Temple of Zeus\nThe Temple of Zeus, situated upon a hill, was the city's main sanctuary. Ceramic finds indicate local habitation from the first half of the third millennium BC. According to a recent reading of the architrave inscription, construction of the temple began under Domitian. Inscriptions document imperial assistance from Hadrian relating to the recovery of unpaid rents as well as the euergetism of Marcus Apuleius Eurykles. Later the Çavdar Tatars carved equestrian and battle scenes on the temple. The temple is pseudodipteral, with eight columns at the ends and fifteen along the sides (35 m × 53 m (115 ft × 174 ft)). It was damaged by the 1970 Gediz earthquake and has since been restored.\n### Theatre and stadium\nAizanoi's theatre and stadium are built adjacent to each other and this combined complex is said to be unique in the ancient world. Separating the two is the stage building. Construction began after 160 A.D. and was complete by the mid-third century. Inscriptions again attest to the benefaction of M. Apuleius Eurycles.\n### Baths\nTwo sets of thermae have been identified. The first, between the theatre-stadium and the temple, dates to the second half of the second century and includes a palaestra and marble furnishings. The second, in the north-east of the city, was built a century later; floor mosaics depict a satyr and maenad. Rebuilt a couple of centuries later, it served as the bishop's seat.\n### Market\nAizanoi is the first recorded place in the world where inflation was calculated and from there spread to other cities of the Roman Empire.\nA circular macellum dating to the second half of the second century is located in the south. In the fourth century it was inscribed with a copy of the Price Edict of Diocletian, dating to 301, an attempt to limit inflation resulting from debasement of the coinage.\n### Colonnaded street and stoa\nRecent excavations have revealed the existence of a stoa, or covered walkway, dating to ca. 400 AD, and colonnaded street. A Temple of Artemis, dating to the time of Claudius (41-54), was demolished to make way for the colonnaded street which ran for 450 m (1,480 ft) and led to the sanctuary of Meter Steunene.\n### Sanctuary of Meter Steunene\nA deep tunnel inside a cave, now collapsed, was dedicated to Meter Steunene (an Anatolian Earth Mother goddess). Cult figurines made of clay have been found in excavations, along with two round pits apparently used for animal sacrifice.\n### Necropolis\nThe city's large necropolis includes examples of door-shaped Phrygian tombstones. Inscriptions give the names of deceased or donor; accompanying decoration includes, for the tombs of men, bulls, lions and eagles, and for those of women, baskets of wool and a mirror.\n## Museum of Kütahya\nSome items from Aizanoi, among them a sarcophagus with an Amazonomachy, have been removed to the Archaeological Museum of Kütahya."], "selected_questions": ["What is the current location of the ruins of Aizanoi?", "When did the construction of the Temple of Zeus begin?", "What is unique about the theatre and stadium complex in Aizanoi?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The ruins of Aizanoi are located in Çavdarhisar, near Kütahya in western Anatolia, Turkey.", "According to the reference, the construction of the Temple of Zeus in Aizanoi began under Domitian.", "The theatre and stadium complex in Aizanoi is unique in the ancient world because it is built adjacent to each other.

{"name": "Culver City, California", "documents": ["# Culver City, California\nCulver City is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 40,779. Founded in 1917 as a \"whites only\" sundown town, it is now an ethnically diverse city with what was called the \"third-most diverse school district in California\" in 2020.\nIn the 1920s, the city became a center for film and later television production, best known as the home of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. From 1932 to 1986, it was the headquarters for the Hughes Aircraft Company. National Public Radio West and Sony Pictures Entertainment have headquarters in the city. The city was named after its founder, Harry Culver. It is mostly surrounded by the city of Los Angeles, but also shares a border with the unincorporated area of Ladera Heights. Over the years, it has annexed more than 40 pieces of adjoining land and now comprises about five square miles (13 km2).\n## History\n### Early history\nArchaeological evidence suggests a human presence in the area of present-day Culver City since at least 8000 BC. The region was the homeland of the Tongva-Gabrieliño Native Americans. For centuries, native people lived in areas currently part of and surrounding Culver City. California's native people were massacred by waves of Spanish, Mexican and Euro-American invaders through a combination of slavery, disease, relocation, forced labor, imprisonment, broken treaties and a genocidal war of extermination, including paid bounties for dead \"Indians\". The Spanish and Mexican governments offered concessions and land grants from 1785 to 1846 forming the Ranchos of California. Culver City was founded on the lands of the former Rancho La Ballona and Rancho Rincon de los Bueyes. When Culver City was founded, native, Hispanic or Latino people were not allowed to buy property.\n### Camp Latham\nIn 1861, during the American Civil War, Camp Latham was established by the 1st California Infantry under Col. James H. Carleton and the 1st California Cavalry under Lt. Col. Benjamin F. Davis. Named for California Senator Milton S. Latham, the camp was the first staging area for the training of Union troops and their operations in Southern California. It was located on land of the Rancho La Ballona, on the south bank of Ballona Creek, near what is now the intersection of Jefferson and Overland Boulevards. The post was later moved to Camp Drum, which became the Drum Barracks.\n### Culver City\nHarry Culver first attempted to establish Culver City in 1913. It was officially incorporated on September 20, 1917, and named after its founder. The area benefited from pre-existing transportation links; Culver's first ads read \"All roads lead to Culver City\". While this slogan might seem welcoming to all, the city was explicitly founded as a whites-only sundown town, as were most of the suburbs and towns outside the downtown and Central Avenue districts of Los Angeles. Culver ran ads promoting \"this model little white city\", while his close associate, Guy M. Rush, promoted lot sales \"restricted to Caucasian race\". The city also at times excluded people of non-Christian religious faiths.\nThe weekly Culver City Call was the first newspaper in the community. The paper was founded in 1915.\nThe first film studio in Culver City was built by Thomas Ince in 1918 for The Triangle Motion Picture Company. Silent film comedy producer Hal Roach built his studios there in 1919, and Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM) took over the Triangle studio complex in 1924. During Prohibition, speakeasies and nightclubs such as the Cotton Club lined Washington Boulevard.\nCulver Center, one of Southern California's first shopping malls, was completed in 1950 on Venice Boulevard near the Overland Avenue intersection. Many other retail stores, including a Rite Aid and several banks and restaurants, have occupied the center since then.\n### Hughes Aircraft Company\nHughes Aircraft opened its Culver City plant in July 1941. There the company built the H-4 Hercules transport (commonly called the \"Spruce Goose\"). Hughes was also an active subcontractor during World War II. It developed and patented a flexible feed chute for faster loading of machine guns on B-17 bombers, and manufactured electric booster drives for machine guns. Hughes produced more ammunition belts than any other American manufacturer, and built 5,576 wings and 6,370 rear fuselage sections for Vultee BT-13 trainers.\nHughes grew after the war, and in 1953 Howard Hughes donated all his stock in the company to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. After he died in 1976, the institute sold the company, which made it the second-best-endowed medical research foundation in the world.\n### The studios (1960s, 1970s and 1980s)\nThe Hal Roach Studios were demolished in 1963. In the late 1960s, much of the MGM backlot acreage (lot 3 and other property on Jefferson Boulevard), and the nearby 28.5 acres (11.5 ha) known as RKO Forty Acres, once owned by RKO Pictures and later Desilu Productions, were sold by their owners. In 1976 the sets were razed to make way for redevelopment. Today, the RKO site is the southern expansion of the Hayden Industrial Tract, while the MGM property has been converted into a subdivision and a shopping center known as Raintree Plaza.\n### Rebirth of downtown (1990s and 2000s)\nIn the early 1990s, Culver City launched a successful revitalization program in which it renovated its downtown as well as several shopping centers in the Sepulveda Boulevard corridor near Westfield Culver City. Around the same time, Sony's motion picture subsidiaries, Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures, moved into the Lorimar Studios lot which was renamed Columbia Studios in 1990 and took on its current name, Sony Pictures Studios, a year later.\nThere was an influx of art galleries and restaurants on the eastern part of the city, which was formally designated the Culver City Art District.\n## Geography\nThe city is surrounded by the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Mar Vista and Palms to the north; Westchester to the south; Mid-City, West Adams, and Baldwin Hills to the east; the Ladera Heights unincorporated area to the southeast; and the L.A. neighborhoods of Venice and Playa Vista to the west, along with the unincorporated area of Marina Del Rey.\nCulver City's major geographic feature is Ballona Creek, which runs northeast to southwest through most of the city before it drains into Santa Monica Bay in Marina Del Rey.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.1 square miles (13.2 km2), over 99% of which is land.\n### Neighborhoods\nThe city recognizes 15 neighborhoods within city limits.\n### Climate\nCulver City has a borderline semi-arid (Köppen: Bsk) and Mediterranean climate (Csb/Csa), typical of coastal southern California.\n## Economy\nCorporations with headquarters in Culver City include Beats Audio, MedMen, National Public Radio (west), NantHealth, Sweetgreen and Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n### Largest employers\nAccording to the city's 2019–20 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city were:\n### Movie and television production\nHundreds of movies have been produced on the lots of Culver City's studios: Sony Pictures Studios (originally MGM Studios), Culver Studios, and the former Hal Roach Studios. In 2017, Amazon Studios announced plans to build a studio in Culver City.\n### Businesses\nWestfield Culver City, a shopping mall.

{"name": "Tallinn Song Festival Grounds", "documents": ["# Tallinn Song Festival Grounds\nThe Tallinn Song Festival Grounds (Estonian: Lauluväljak) are the grounds on which the Estonian Song Festival is held every five years.\n## History of song festivals\nIn 1869 Johann Voldemar Jannsen established the Estonian Song Festival while the nation was still a province of the Russian Empire. This festival was considered responsible for fostering an Estonian national awakening. After that, the new tradition was born and the festivals are still held every five years.\n## Lauluväljak – The Tallinn Song Festival Grounds\nThe first stage on its current location between Narva Road and Pirita Road in Kadriorg, was built in 1928 for the 9th Estonian Song Festival. It was designed by Karl Burman and provided space for 15,000 performers.\nDuring the Occupation of Estonia by the Soviet Union, there was a need for a larger stage. The new and current arched stage was built in 1959 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Estonian SSR in the upcoming year. It was designed by architect Henno Sepmann together with Alar Kotli and Endel Paalmann. The 15th Estonian Song Festival in 1960 was celebrated on the new stage. The stage was meant to hold over 15,000 singers but the reverse also became possible, with the performance taking place in front of the stage and audience sitting on the stage. On the northern side of the song stage is the 42m high fire tower, which is used during the Estonian Song Festivals. It is open for the public all year long.\nIn 1988, Estonians gathered at the Tallinn Song Festival Grounds, to sing patriotic hymns in what became known as the Singing Revolution that led to the overthrow of Soviet rule.\nAlso in 1988, three years before the collapse of the Soviet Union and Estonia's reestablishment of independence, an international rock concert called the Summer of Rock (also referred to as Glasnost Rock) took place on the Tallinn Song Festival Grounds between August 26 and 28. Headlining acts included Public Image Ltd (PiL), Big Country and Steve Hackett. The concert attracted over 130,000 attendees. Rock Summer would continue each summer until 1997.\nToday, Tallinn's Song Festival Grounds are also used for hosting international acts, such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner, 50 Cent, Metallica, The Rolling Stones, Elton John, Depeche Mode, Pet Shop Boys, Andrea Bocelli, Madonna, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Lady Gaga, Green Day, José Carreras, Robbie Williams and the contemporary dance music event, the Sundance Festival.\nIn August 2009, Madonna performed in front of a sold-out crowd of 72,067. In June 2006, Metallica gave a concert for more than 78,000 fans. In August 1997, Michael Jackson performed in front of an 85,000 head crowd.\nAn optimal capacity for concerts is 75,000 fans. In June 1988, during the Singing Revolution days, up to 300,000 people attended the Night Song Festival. In the years to come, however, this figure has been questioned. During the Song Festivals, when the grounds are well packed, the number of people in the audience may reach 100,000.\n## Notable performers\nMetallica, Pink, and many others have performed at the grounds.\nMichael Jackson performed there as part of his HIStory World Tour on August 22, 1997. Tina Turner performed there as part of her Twenty Four Seven Tour on August 12, 2000. Madonna performed there as part of their Sticky & Sweet Tour on August 4, 2009. It was their first concert in the Baltic states. Thirty Seconds to Mars performed there as part of their Into the Wild Tour on June 21, 2011. Red Hot Chili Peppers performed there as part of their tour on July 30, 2012. Lady Gaga performed there for 16,000 fans of the European leg of her Born This Way Ball Tour on August 25, 2012. Green Day performed there with their 99 Revolutions Tour on June 25, 2013. Elton John performed with Tallinn Star Weekend on June 29, 2013. Robbie Williams performed at the venue on August 20, 2013, as a part of his Take the Crown Stadium Tour. The show was broadcast live in cinemas across Europe.

{"name": "Khanqah-e-Moula", "documents": ["# Khanqah-e-Moula\nKhanqah-e-Moula (Kashmiri: خانٛقاهِ معلىٰ), also known as Shah-e-Hamadan Masjid and Khanqah, is a mosque located in the Old City of Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir, India. Situated on the right bank of the river Jhelum between the Fateh Kadal and Zaina Kadal bridges, it was first built in 1395 CE, commissioned by Sultan Sikendar in memory of Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani. It is held to be the first Khanqah—mosques associated with specific saints—in the Kashmir valley. It is one of the best examples of Kashmiri wooden architecture, and is decorated with papier mache.\n## Construction\nThe mosque was commissioned by Sultan Sikandar Butshikan in 1395 CE in memory of the Islamic preacher Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani, the central figure involved in the widespread conversion to Islam in Kashmir. Also known as Shah-e-Hamadan (the King of Hamadan), the preacher came to Kashmir from the city of Hamadan, Persia in the 14th century. He is credited for the spread of Islam in Kashmir. In 1480 AD, the shrine was destroyed in a fire. The then ruler, Sultan Hassan Shah, expanded its premises and rebuilt it. In 1731 CE, the Khanqah was again destroyed by fire and then rebuilt by Abdul Barkat Khan.\n## Background\nThe current mosque structure was constructed above near the walls of an ancient temple dedicated to Hindu goddess Kali and a sacred Hindu site, It is believed by some that Sayyid Ali Hamdani had the temple of Kali wall erected between empty land and built the present mosque. and that a spring dedicated to Kali is still inside the mosque. The railing at the back of the mosque complex leads to a bright orange marking on the stone just below that suggests to the foundation belonging to the destructed Kali Shri temple. Local Hindus were involved in various communal disputes and repeated altercations by 1942, agitating for the right to build a covered shrine adjacent to the Muslim shrine, which eventually led to a boycott of Muslim-owned shops by Kashmiri Hindus.\nHowever, others have questioned the validity of such claims, and believe it to be a revisionist attempt to re-cast history as traditional Kashmiri Hindu historians, such as Kalhana, Jonaraja and Shuk Bhatt make no mention of the existence of any temple at the site of the structure. The counterclaim stemming from the fact that a Hindu religious site also exists adjacent to the shrine and the historians have suggested that the two sites have in fact always been adjacent to one another, their proximity being representative of communal tolerance. Kashmiri Hindus have also historically held the Khanqah in high reverence.\nArchaeologist R.C. Kak in Ancient Monuments of Kashmir and historian P. N. K. Bamzai in Culture and Political History of Kashmir while writing about the Khanqah, do not altogether mention anything about the possibility of the existence of a temple where the present structure stands. Historian Ashiq Husain Bhat further argues that re-purposing of Hindu shrines into Muslim ones wouldn't have been unusual, given that the overwhelming majority of Kashmiris converted to Islam, and a similar conversion of the site into a church would occur were Kashmiris to convert en masse to Christianity. The construction of Muslim shrines at Hindu sites has also been interpreted by some as an attempt by Kashmiri Muslim to maintain links to their Hindu past.\n### Adjacent Kali Shri Shrine\nToward the River Jhelum, there is a wall marked with Sindoor (or Sindooram, a traditional vermilion red or orange-red colored cosmetic powder from India, usually worn by married women along the parting of their hair) but not a temple and water oozes at a place, which Kashmiri Hindus say is dedicated to goddess Kali.\nSaleem Beg, a member of INTACH, states that the holy place of Hindus and the Khanqah co-existed together.\n### Fire of 2017\nOn 15 November 2017, a fire broke out in the shrine which damaged the spire of the building. Fire tenders were brought on the scene and they managed to arrest the spread of the fire which prevented any further damage to the building.\nRestoration work was immediately started and on 30 March 2018, a refurbished crown was successfully installed on the spire of the shrine."], "selected_questions": ["What is Khanqah-e-Moula also known as?", "Who was Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani?", "When did the fire break out in Khanqah-e-Moula and what was damaged as a result of the fire?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Khanqah-e-Moula is also known as Shah-e-Hamadan Masjid and Khanqah.", "Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani was an Islamic preacher and central figure involved in the widespread conversion to Islam in Kashmir.

{"name": "Nashville, Tennessee", "documents": ["# Nashville, Tennessee\nNashville is the capital city of the U.S. state of Tennessee and the seat of Davidson County. With a population of 689,447 at the 2020 U.S. census, Nashville is the most populous city in the state, 21st most-populous city in the U.S., and the fourth most populous city in the southeastern U.S. Located on the Cumberland River, the city is the center of the Nashville metropolitan area, which is one of the fastest growing in the nation.\nNamed for Francis Nash, a general of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, the city was founded in 1779. The city grew quickly due to its strategic location as a port on the Cumberland River and, in the 19th century, a railroad center. Nashville seceded with Tennessee during the American Civil War; in 1862 it was the first state capital in the Confederacy to be taken by Union forces. After the war, the city reclaimed its position and developed a manufacturing base.\nSince 1963, Nashville has had a consolidated city-county government, which includes six smaller municipalities in a two-tier system. The city is governed by a mayor, a vice-mayor, and a 40-member metropolitan council; 35 of the members are elected from single-member districts, while the other five are elected at-large. Reflecting the city's position in state government, Nashville is home to the Tennessee Supreme Court's courthouse for Middle Tennessee, one of the state's three divisions.\nNashville is considered a global city type \"Gamma\" by the GaWC as of 2020. A major center for the music industry, especially country music, Nashville is commonly known as \"Music City\". It is home to three major professional sports teams, the Predators, Titans, and Nashville SC. Nashville is also home to numerous colleges and universities, including Tennessee State University, Vanderbilt University, Belmont University, Fisk University, Trevecca Nazarene University, and Lipscomb University. Nashville is sometimes referred to as the \"Athens of the South\" due to the large number of educational institutions. The city is also a major center for the healthcare, publishing, banking, automotive, technology, and transportation industries. Entities with headquarters in the city include AllianceBernstein, Asurion, Bridgestone Americas, Captain D's, Hospital Corporation of America, LifeWay Christian Resources, Logan's Roadhouse, and Ryman Hospitality Properties.\n## History\n### 18th and 19th centuries\nIn 1689, French-Canadian trader Martin Chartier established a trading post on the Cumberland River, near the present-day site of the city. In 1714, a group of French traders under the command of Charles Charleville established a settlement and trading post at the present location of downtown Nashville, which became known as French Lick. These settlers quickly established an extensive fur trading network with the local Native Americans, but by the 1740s the settlement had largely been abandoned.\nIn 1779, explorers James Robertson and John Donelson led a party of Overmountain Men to the site of French Lick, and constructed Fort Nashborough. It was named for Francis Nash, the American Revolutionary War hero. Nashville quickly grew because of its strategic location as a port on the Cumberland River, a tributary of the Ohio River; and its later status as a major railroad center. By 1800, the city had 345 residents, including 136 enslaved African Americans and 14 free African Americans. In 1806, Nashville was incorporated as a city and became the county seat of Davidson County, Tennessee. In 1843, the city was named as the permanent capital of the state of Tennessee. Knoxville, Kingston & Murfreesboro were prior locations of the state capital.\nThe city government of Nashville owned 24 slaves by 1831, and 60 prior to the Civil War. They were \"put to work to build the first successful water system and maintain the streets.\" Auction blocks and brokers' offices were part of the slave market at the heart of the city. It was the center of plantations cultivating tobacco and hemp as commodity crops, in addition to the breeding and training of thoroughbred horses, and other livestock. For years Nashville was considered one of the wealthiest southern capitals and a large portion of its prominence was from the iron business. Nashville led the south for iron production.\nThe cholera epidemic that struck Nashville in 1849–1850 took the life of former U.S. President James K. Polk and resulted in high fatalities. There were 311 deaths from cholera in 1849 and an estimated 316 to about 500 in 1850.\nBefore the Civil War, about 700 free Blacks lived in small enclaves in northern Nashville. More than 3,200 enslaved African Americans lived in the city. By 1860, when the first rumblings of secession began to be heard across the South, antebellum Nashville was a prosperous city.\nThe city's significance as a shipping port and rail center made it a desirable prize for competing military forces that wanted to control the region's important river and railroad transportation routes. In February 1862, Nashville became the first Confederate state capital to fall to Union troops, and the state was occupied by Union troops for the duration of the war. Many enslaved African Americans from Middle Tennessee fled as refugees to Union lines; they were housed in contraband camps around military installations in Nashville's eastern, western, and southern borders. The Battle of Nashville (December 15–16, 1864) was a significant Union victory and perhaps the most decisive tactical victory gained by either side in the war; it was also the war's final major military action in which Tennessee regiments played a large part on both sides of the battle. Afterward, the Confederates conducted a war of attrition, making guerrilla raids and engaging in small skirmishes. Confederate forces in the Deep South were almost constantly in retreat.\nIn 1868, three years after the end of the Civil War, the Nashville chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded by Confederate veteran John W. Morton. He was reported to have initiated General Nathan Bedford Forrest into the vigilante organization. The latter became Grand Wizard of the organization, which had chapters of this secret, insurgent group forming throughout the state and across the South. They opposed voting and political organizing by freedmen, tried to control their behavior by threats, violence and murder, and sometimes also attacked their White allies, including schoolteachers from the North and Freedman's Bureau officials.\nWhites directed violence against freedmen and their descendants both during and after the Reconstruction era. Two freedmen, David Jones and Jo Reed, were lynched in Nashville by White mobs in 1872 and 1875, respectively. Reed was hanged from a bridge over the river, but survived after the rope broke and he fell into the water. He successfully escaped the city soon thereafter.\nIn 1873, Nashville suffered another cholera epidemic, along with towns throughout Sumner County along railroad routes and the Cumberland River. This was part of a larger epidemic that struck the Mississippi Valley system and other areas of the United States, such as New York and towns along its major lakes and rivers. The epidemic is estimated to have killed around 1,000 people in Nashville, and 50,000 total.\nMeanwhile, the city had reclaimed its important shipping and trading position and developed a solid manufacturing base. The post–Civil War years of the late 19th century brought new prosperity to Nashville and Davidson County. Wealthy planters and businessmen built grand, classical-style buildings. A replica of the Parthenon was constructed in Centennial Park, near downtown.\nOn April 30, 1892, Ephraim Grizzard, an African-American man, was lynched in a spectacle murder in front of a European-American mob of 10,000 in Nashville. He was a suspect in the assault of two white sisters. His lynching was described by journalist Ida B. Wells as: \"A naked, bloody example of the blood-thirstiness of the nineteenth century civilization of the Athens of the South.\" His brother, Henry Grizzard, had been lynched and hanged on April 24, 1892, in nearby Goodlettsville as a suspect in the same assault incident. From 1877 to 1950, a total of six lynchings of Blacks were conducted in Davidson County, four before the turn of the century.\n### Earlier 20th century\nBy the turn of the century Nashville was home to numerous organizations and individuals associated with revisionist Lost Cause of the Confederacy pseudohistory, and it has been referred to as the \"cradle of the Lost Cause.\" In 1893, the magazine Confederate Veteran began publication in the city. In 1894, the first chapter of United Daughters of the Confederacy was founded in the city, and it hosted the first two conventions of the organization. Prominent proponents of the mythology, the so-called \"guardians of the Lost Cause,\" were concentrated Downtown and in the West End, near Centennial Park.\nAt the same time, Jefferson Street became the historic center of the African American community, with similar districts developing in the Black neighborhoods in East and North Nashville. In 1912, the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial and Normal School was moved to Jefferson Street. The first Prince's Hot Chicken Shack originated at the corner of Jefferson Street and 28th Avenue in 1945. Jefferson Street became a destination for jazz and blues musicians, and remained so until the federal government split the area by construction of Interstate 40 in the late 1960s.\nIn 1950, the state legislature approved a new city charter that provided for the election of city council members from single-member districts, rather than at-large voting. This change was supported because at-large voting required candidates to gain a majority of votes from across the city. The previous system prevented the minority population, which then tended to support Republican candidates, from being represented by candidates of their choice; apportionment under single-member districts meant that some districts in Nashville had Black majorities. In 1951, after passage of the new charter, African American attorneys Z. Alexander Looby and Robert E. Lillard were elected to the city council.\nWith the United States Supreme Court ruling in 1954 that public schools had to desegregate with \"all deliberate speed\", the family of student Robert Kelley filed a lawsuit in 1956, arguing that Nashville administrators should open all-White East High School to him. A similar case was filed by Reverend Henry Maxwell due to his children having to take a 45-minute bus ride from South Nashville to the north end of the city. These suits caused the courts to announce what became known as the \"Nashville Plan\", where the city's public schools would desegregate one grade per year beginning in the fall of 1957.\nUrban redevelopment accelerated over the next several decades, and the city grew increasingly segregated. An interstate was placed on the edge of East Nashville while another highway was built through Edgehill, a lower-income, predominantly minority community.\n### Postwar development to present\nRapid suburbanization occurred during the years immediately after World War II, as new housing was being built outside city limits. This resulted in a demand for many new schools and other support facilities, which the county found difficult to provide. At the same time, suburbanization led to a declining tax base in the city, although many suburban residents used unique city amenities and services that were supported financially only by city taxpayers. After years of discussion, a referendum was held in 1958 on the issue of consolidating city and county government. It failed to gain approval although it was supported by the then-elected leaders of both jurisdictions, County Judge Beverly Briley and Mayor Ben West.\nFollowing the referendum's failure, Nashville annexed some 42 square miles of suburban jurisdictions to expand its tax base. This increased uncertainty among residents, and created resentment among many suburban communities. Under the second charter for metropolitan government, which was approved in 1962, two levels of service provision were proposed: the General Services District and the Urban Services District, to provide for a differential in tax levels. Residents of the Urban Services District had a full range of city services. The areas that made up the General Services District, however, had a lower tax rate until full services were provided. This helped reconcile aspects of services and taxation among the differing jurisdictions within the large metro region.\nIn the early 1960s, Tennessee still had racial segregation of public facilities, including lunch counters and department store fitting rooms. Hotels and restaurants were also segregated. Between February 13 and May 10, 1960, a series of sit-ins were organized at lunch counters in downtown Nashville by the Nashville Student Movement and Nashville Christian Leadership Council, and were part of a broader sit-in movement in the southeastern United States as part of an effort to end racial segregation of public facilities. On April 19, 1960, the house of Z. Alexander Looby, an African American attorney and council member, was bombed by segregationists. Protesters marched to the city hall the next day. Mayor Ben West said he supported the desegregation of lunch counters, which civil rights activists had called for.\nIn 1963, Nashville consolidated its government with Davidson County, forming a metropolitan government. The membership on the Metro Council, the legislative body, was increased from 21 to 40 seats. Of these, five members are elected at-large and 35 are elected from single-member districts, each to serve a term of four years. In 1957 Nashville desegregated its school system using an innovative grade a year plan, in response to a class action suit Kelly vs. Board of Education of Nashville. By 1966 the Metro Council abandoned the grade a year plan and completely desegregated the entire school system at one time.\nCongress passed civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965, but tensions continued as society was slow to change. On April 8, 1967, a riot broke out on the college campuses of Fisk University and Tennessee State University, historically Black colleges, after Stokely Carmichael spoke about Black Power at Vanderbilt University. Although it was viewed as a \"race riot\", it had classist characteristics.\nIn 1979, the Ku Klux Klan burnt crosses outside two African American sites in Nashville, including the city headquarters of the NAACP.\nSince the 1970s, the city and county have undergone tremendous growth, particularly during the economic boom of the 1990s under the leadership of then-Mayor and later-Tennessee Governor, Phil Bredesen. Making urban renewal a priority, Bredesen fostered the construction or renovation of several city landmarks, including the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, the downtown Nashville Public Library, the Bridgestone Arena, and Nissan Stadium.\nNissan Stadium (formerly Adelphia Coliseum and LP Field) was built after the National Football League's (NFL) Houston Oilers agreed to move to the city in 1995. The NFL team debuted in Nashville in 1998 at Vanderbilt Stadium, and Nissan Stadium opened in the summer of 1999. The Oilers changed their name to the Tennessee Titans and finished the season with the Music City Miracle and a close Super Bowl game. The St. Louis Rams won in the last play of the game.\nIn 1997, Nashville was awarded a National Hockey League expansion team; this was named the Nashville Predators. Since the 2003–04 season, the Predators have made the playoffs in all but three seasons. In 2017, they made the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history, but ultimately fell to the Pittsburgh Penguins, 4 games to 2, in the best-of-seven series.\n### 21st century\nOn January 22, 2009, residents rejected Nashville Charter Amendment 1, which sought to make English the official language of the city.\nBetween May 1 and 7, 2010, much of Nashville was extensively flooded as part of a series of 1,000 year floods throughout Middle and West Tennessee. Much of the flooding took place in areas along the Cumberland and Harpeth Rivers and Mill Creek, and caused extensive damage to the many buildings and structures in the city, including the Grand Ole Opry House, Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center, Opry Mills Mall, Schermerhorn Symphony Center, Bridgestone Arena, and Nissan Stadium. Sections of Interstate 24 and Briley Parkway were also flooded. Eleven people died in the Nashville area as a result of the flooding, and damages were estimated to be over $2 billion.\nThe city recovered after the Great Recession. In March 2012, a Gallup poll ranked Nashville in the top five regions for job growth. In 2013, Nashville was described as \"Nowville\" and \"It City\" by GQ, Forbes, and The New York Times.\nNashville elected its first female mayor, Megan Barry, on September 25, 2015. As a council member, Barry had officiated at the city's first same-sex wedding on June 26, 2015.\nIn 2017, Nashville's economy was deemed the third fastest-growing in the nation, and the city was named the \"hottest housing market in the US\" by Freddie Mac realtors. In May 2017, census estimates showed Nashville had passed Memphis to become most populated city in Tennessee. Nashville has also made national headlines for its \"homelessness crisis\". Rising housing prices and the opioid crisis have resulted in more people being out on the streets: as of 2018, between 2,300 and 20,000 Nashvillians are homeless.\nOn March 6, 2018, due to felony charges filed against Mayor Barry relating to the misuse of public funds, she resigned before the end of her term. A special election was called. Following a ruling by the Tennessee Supreme Court, the Davidson County Election Commission set the special election for May 24, 2018, to meet the requirement of 75 to 80 days from the date of resignation. David Briley, who was Vice Mayor during the Barry administration and Acting Mayor after her resignation, won the special election with just over 54% of the vote, becoming the 70th mayor of Nashville.\nOn May 1, 2018, voters rejected Let's Move Nashville, a referendum which would have funded construction of an $8.9 billion mass transit system under the Nashville Metropolitan Transit Authority, by a 2 to 1 margin.\nOn September 28, 2019, John Cooper became the ninth mayor of Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County.\nOn March 3, 2020, a tornado tracked west to east, just north of the downtown Nashville area, killing at least 25 people and leaving tens of thousands without electricity. Neighborhoods impacted included North Nashville, Germantown, East Nashville, Donelson, and Hermitage.\nOn December 25, 2020, a vehicle exploded on Second Avenue, killing the perpetrator and injuring eight others.\n## Geography\n### Topography\nNashville lies on the Cumberland River in the northwestern portion of the Nashville Basin. Nashville's elevation ranges from its lowest point, 385 feet (117 m) above sea level at the Cumberland River, to its highest point, 1,163 feet (354 m) above sea level in the Radnor Lake State Natural Area. Nashville also sits at the start of the Highland Rim, a geophysical region of very hilly land. Because of this, Nashville is very hilly. Nashville also has some stand alone hills around the city such as the hill on which the Tennessee State Capitol building sits. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 527.9 square miles (1,367 km2), of which 504.0 square miles (1,305 km2) of it is land and 23.9 square miles (62 km2) of it (4.53%) is water.\n### Cityscape\nNashville's downtown area features a diverse assortment of entertainment, dining, cultural and architectural attractions. The Broadway and 2nd Avenue areas feature entertainment venues, night clubs and an assortment of restaurants. North of Broadway lie Nashville's central business district, Legislative Plaza, Capitol Hill and the Tennessee Bicentennial Mall. Cultural and architectural attractions can be found throughout the city.\nThree major interstate highways (I-40, I-65 and I-24) converge near the core area of downtown, and many regional cities are within a day's driving distance.\nNashville's first skyscraper, the Life & Casualty Tower, was completed in 1957 and launched the construction of other high rises in downtown Nashville. After the construction of the AT&T Building (commonly referred to by locals as the \"Batman Building\") in 1994, the downtown area saw little construction until the mid-2000s. The Pinnacle, a high rise office building which opened in 2010, was the first skyscraper in Nashville to be built in the preceding 15 years.\nSince 2000, Nashville has seen two urban construction booms (one prior to the Great Recession and the other after) that have yielded multiple high-rises (defined by Emporis as buildings of a minimum of 115 feet tall). Of the city's 37 towers of 280 feet tall or taller, 24 have been completed since 2000.\nMany civic and infrastructure projects are being planned, in progress, or recently completed. A new MTA bus hub was recently completed in downtown Nashville, as was the Music City Star pilot project. Several public parks have been constructed, such as the Public Square. Riverfront Park is scheduled to be extensively updated. The Music City Center opened in May 2013. It is a 1,200,000 square foot (110,000 m2) convention center with 370,000 square feet (34,000 m2) of exhibit space.\n### Flora\nThe nearby city of Lebanon is notable and even named for its so-called \"cedar glades\", which occur on soils too poor to support most trees and are instead dominated by Virginian juniper. Blackberry bushes, Virginia pine, loblolly pine, sassafras, red maple, river birch, American beech, river cane, mountain laurel and sycamore are all common native trees, along with many others.\nIn addition to the native forests, the combination of hot summers, abundant rainfall and mild winters permit a wide variety of both temperate and subtropical plants to be cultivated easily. Southern magnolia and cherry blossom trees are commonly cultivated here, with the city having an annual cherry blossom festival. Crepe myrtles and yew bushes are also commonly grown throughout Metro Nashville, and the winters are mild enough that sweetbay magnolia is evergreen whenever it is cultivated. The pansy flower is popular to plant during the autumn, and some varieties will flower overwinter in Nashville's subtropical climate. However, many hot-weather plants like petunia and even papyrus thrive as annuals, and Japanese banana will die aboveground during winter but re-sprout after the danger of frost is over. Unbeknownst to most Tennesseans, even cold-hardy palms, particularly needle palm and dwarf palmetto, are grown uncommonly but often successfully. High desert plants like Colorado spruce and prickly pear cactus are also grown somewhat commonly, as are Yucca filamentosa.\n### Climate\nNashville International Airport in Donelson has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa, Trewartha Cf), with hot, humid summers and generally cool winters typical of the Upper South.\nSnowfall occurs during the winter months, but it is usually not heavy. Average annual snowfall is about 4.7 inches (12 cm), falling mostly in January and February and occasionally in March, November and December. The largest snow event since 2003 was on January 22, 2016, when Nashville received 8 inches (20 cm) of snow in a single storm; the largest overall was 17 inches (43 cm), received on March 17, 1892, during the St. Patrick's Day Snowstorm.\nRainfall is typically greater in solar spring (Feb-Apr) and summer (May-Jul), while the solar autumn months (Aug-Oct) are the driest on average. Spring and fall are prone to severe thunderstorms, which may bring tornadoes, large hail, flash floods and damaging wind, with recent major events on April 16, 1998; April 7, 2006; February 5, 2008; April 10, 2009; May 1–2, 2010; and March 3, 2020. Relative humidity in Nashville averages 83% in the mornings and 60% in the afternoons, which is considered moderate for the Southeastern United States. In recent decades, due to urban development, Nashville has developed an urban heat island; especially on cool, clear nights, temperatures are up to 10 °F (5.6 °C) warmer in the heart of the city than in rural outlying areas. The Nashville region lies within USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7a. From 1970 to 2020 the average summer temperature has risen 2.8 degrees.\nNashville's long springs and autumns combined with a diverse array of trees and grasses can often make it uncomfortable for allergy sufferers. In 2008, Nashville was ranked as the 18th-worst spring allergy city in the U.S. by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.\nThe coldest temperature ever officially recorded in Nashville was −17 °F (−27 °C) on January 21, 1985, and the hottest was 109 °F (43 °C) on June 29, 2012. Nashville allegedly had a low of −18 °F (−28 °C) on January 26, 1832, but this was decades before record-keeping began and isn't counted as the official record low.\n#### Donelson\nThe mean annual temperature at Nashville International Airport is 60.8 °F (16.0 °C). Monthly averages range from 39.6 °F (4.2 °C) in January to 80.7 °F (27.1 °C) in July, with a diurnal temperature variation of 18.9 to 23.7 °F (10.5 to 13.2 °C). Diurnal temperature variation is highest in April and lowest in December, but it is also relatively high in October and relatively low in January. Donelson's climate classifications are Köppen Cfa and Trewartha CFak thanks to its very hot summers (average over 71.6 °F (22.0 °C)), mild winters (average over 32.0 °F (0.0 °C)) and long (8+ months) growing seasons (average over 50.0 °F (10.0 °C)). Precipitation is abundant year-round without any major difference, but there is still slight variation. The wet season runs from February through July, reaching its zenith in May with 128 mm of rain.

Monthly averages range from 37.1 °F (2.8 °C) in January to 78.6 °F (25.9 °C) in August, with a diurnal temperature variation of 19.8 to 26.3 °F (11.0 to 14.6 °C). Diurnal temperature variation is highest in April and lowest in January. Old Hickory's climate classifications are Köppen Cfa and Trewartha DOak thanks to its very hot summers (average over 71.6 °F (22.0 °C)), mild winters (average over 32.0 °F (0.0 °C)) and mediocre (4–7 months) growing seasons (average over 50.0 °F (10.0 °C)). Precipitation is abundant year-round without any major difference, but there is still slight variation. The wet season runs from February through July, reaching its zenith in April with 120 mm of rain. The dry season runs from August through January with an October/November nadir of 85 mm and secondary December peak of 113 mm. Data for record temperatures is spotty before June 2007, but temperatures in Old Hickory have been known to range from −10 °F (−23.3 °C) in January 1966 to 106 °F (41.1 °C) in June and July 2012.\n## Demographics\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 689,447 people, 279,545 households, and 146,241 families residing in the city.

Nashville's foreign-born population more than tripled in size between 1990 and 2000, increasing from 12,662 to 39,596. The city's largest immigrant groups include Mexicans, Kurds, Vietnamese, Laotians, Arabs, and Somalis.

Many popular food companies are based in Nashville including Captain D's, Hunt Brothers Pizza, O'Charley's, Logan's Roadhouse, J. Alexander's, and Stoney River Legendary Steaks.\nAs the \"home of country music\", Nashville has become a major music recording and production center. The Big Three record labels, as well as numerous independent labels, have offices in Nashville, mostly in the Music Row area. Nashville has been the headquarters of guitar company Gibson since 1984. Since the 1960s, Nashville has been the second-largest music production center (after New York City) in the United States. Nashville's music industry is estimated to have a total economic impact of about $10 billion per year and to contribute about 56,000 jobs to the Nashville area.\nThe area's largest industry is health care. Nashville is home to more than 300 health care companies, including Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), the world's largest private operator of hospitals. As of 2012, it was estimated the health care industry contributes US$30 billion per year and 200,000 jobs to the Nashville-area economy.\nCoreCivic, formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America and one of the largest private corrections company in the United States, was founded in Nashville in 1983, but moved out of the city in 2019. Vanderbilt University was one of its investors before the company's initial public offering. The City of Nashville's pension fund included \"a $921,000 stake\" in the company in 2017. The Nashville Scene notes that, \"A drop in CoreCivic stock value, however minor, would have a direct impact on the pension fund that represents nearly 25,000 current and former Metro employees.\"\nThe automotive industry is also becoming important for the Middle Tennessee region. Nissan North America moved its corporate headquarters in 2006 from Gardena, California (Los Angeles County) to Franklin, a suburb south of Nashville. Nissan's largest North American manufacturing plant is in Smyrna, another suburb of Nashville. Largely as a result of the increased development of Nissan and other Japanese economic interests in the region, Japan moved its former New Orleans consulate-general to Nashville's Palmer Plaza.

As of October 2015, according to city figures, there is more than $2 billion in real estate projects underway or projected to start in 2016. Due to high yields available to investors, Nashville has been attracting a lot of capital from out-of-state. A key factor that has been attributed to the increase in investment is the adjustment to the city's zoning code. Developers can easily include a combination of residential, office, retail and entertainment space into their projects. Additionally, the city has invested heavily into public parks. Centennial Park is undergoing extensive renovations. The change in the zoning code and the investment in public space is consistent with the millennial generation's preference for walkable urban neighborhoods.\n### Top employers\nAccording to the Nashville Business Journal, the top employers in the city are:\n## Culture\nMuch of the city's cultural life has revolved around its large university community. Particularly significant in this respect were two groups of critics and writers who were associated with Vanderbilt University in the early 20th century: the Fugitives and the Agrarians.\nPopular destinations include Fort Nashborough and Fort Negley, the former being a reconstruction of the original settlement, the latter being a semi-restored Civil War battle fort; the Tennessee State Museum; and The Parthenon, a full-scale replica of the original Parthenon in Athens.

With a long history in the music scene it is no surprise that city was nicknamed 'Music City.' The Tennessee Performing Arts Center is the major performing arts center of the city. It is the home of the Nashville Repertory Theatre, the Nashville Opera, the Music City Drum and Bugle Corps, and the Nashville Ballet. In September 2006, the Schermerhorn Symphony Center opened as the home of the Nashville Symphony.\nAs the city's name itself is a metonym for the country music industry, many popular attractions involve country music, including the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, Belcourt Theatre, and Ryman Auditorium. Hence, the city became known as America's 'Country Music Capital.' The Ryman was home to the Grand Ole Opry until 1974 when the show moved to the Grand Ole Opry House, 9 miles (14 km) east of downtown. The Opry plays there several times a week, except for an annual winter run at the Ryman.\nMany music clubs and honky-tonk bars are in downtown Nashville, particularly the area encompassing Lower Broadway, Second Avenue, and Printer's Alley, which is often referred to as \"the District\".\nEach June, the CMA Music Festival (formerly known as Fan Fair) brings thousands of country fans to the city.

The Francis Craig Orchestra entertained Nashvillians from 1929 to 1945 from the Oak Bar and Grille Room in the Hermitage Hotel. Craig's orchestra was also the first to broadcast over local radio station WSM-AM and enjoyed phenomenal success with a 12-year show on the NBC Radio Network. In the late 1930s, he introduced a newcomer, Dinah Shore, a local graduate of Hume Fogg High School and Vanderbilt University.\nRadio station WMOT-FM in nearby Murfreesboro, which formerly programmed jazz, aided significantly in the recent revival of the city's jazz scene, as has the non-profit Nashville Jazz Workshop, which holds concerts and classes in a renovated building in the north Nashville neighborhood of Germantown.

In 2017, Nashville Scene counted 33 bachelorette parties on Lower Broadway (\"from Fifth Avenue down to the Cumberland River, it's their town\") in less than two hours on a Friday night, and stated that the actual number was likely higher. Downtown, the newspaper wrote, \"offers five blocks of bars with live music and no cover\". In 2018, The New York Times called Nashville \"the hottest destination for bachelorette parties in the country\" because of the honky-tonk bars' live music. City boosters welcome the bachelorette parties because temporary visitors may become permanent; BuzzFeed wrote, \"These women are at precisely the point in their lives when a move to Nashville is possible\". The CMT reality television series Bachelorette Weekend follows the employees at Bach Weekend, a Nashville company that designs and throws bachelor and bachelorette parties.\n### Nicknames\nNashville is a colorful, well-known city in several different arenas. As such, it has earned various sobriquets, including:\nMusic City, U.S.A.: WSM-AM announcer David Cobb first used this name during a 1950 broadcast and it stuck. It is now the official nickname used by the Nashville Convention and Visitors Bureau. Nashville is the home of the Grand Ole Opry, the Country Music Hall of Fame, and many major record labels. This name also dates back to 1873, where after receiving and hearing a performance by the Fisk Jubilee Singers, Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom is reported as saying that \"These young people must surely come from a musical city.\" Athens of the South: Home to 24 post-secondary educational institutions, Nashville has long been compared to Athens, the ancient city of learning and site of Plato's Academy. Since 1897, a full-scale replica of the Athenian Parthenon has stood in Nashville, and many examples of classical and neoclassical architecture can be found in the city. The term was popularized by Philip Lindsley (1786–1855), President of the University of Nashville, though it is unclear whether he was the first person to use the phrase. The Protestant Vatican or The Buckle of the Bible Belt: Nashville has over 700 churches, several seminaries, a number of Christian music companies, and is the headquarters for the publishing arms of the Southern Baptist Convention (LifeWay Christian Resources), the United Methodist Church (United Methodist Publishing House) and the National Baptist Convention (Sunday School Publishing Board). It is also the seat of the National Baptist Convention, the National Association of Free Will Baptists, the Gideons International, the Gospel Music Association, and Thomas Nelson, the world's largest producer of Bibles. Cashville: Nashville native Young Buck released a successful rap album called Straight Outta Cashville that has popularized the nickname among a new generation. Little Kurdistan: Nashville has the United States' largest population of Kurdish people, estimated to be around 11,000. Nash Vegas or Nashvegas\nNashville has additionally earned the moniker \"The Hot Chicken Capital\", becoming known for the local specialty cuisine hot chicken. The Music City Hot Chicken Festival is hosted annually in Nashville and several restaurants make this spicy version of southern fried chicken.\n## Sports\n### Professional\nNashville is home to five professional sports franchises. Three play at the highest professional level of their respective sports: the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League (NFL), the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL), and Nashville SC of Major League Soccer (MLS). The city is also home to two minor league teams: the Nashville Sounds of Minor League Baseball's International League and the Music City Fire arena football team of the American Arena League. An investment group, Music City Baseball, seeks to secure a Major League Baseball expansion franchise or lure an existing team to the city. The Women's Basketball National Association is considering a franchise expansion to Nashville.\nThe Tennessee Titans moved to Nashville in 1998. Previously known as the Houston Oilers, which began play in 1960 in Houston, Texas, the team relocated to Tennessee in 1997. They played at the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis for one season, then moved to Nashville in 1998 and played in Vanderbilt Stadium for one season. During those two years, the team was known as the Tennessee Oilers, but changed its name to Titans in 1999. The team now plays at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, which opened in 1999. Since moving to Nashville, the Titans have won five division championships (2000, 2002, 2008, 2020, and 2021) and one conference championship (1999). They competed in 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV, losing to the St. Louis Rams, 23–16.

The Sounds won the league championship in 1979 and 1982. In 1985, the Double-A Sounds were replaced by a Triple-A team of the American Association. After the circuit dissolved in 1997, they joined the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1998 and won the league championship in 2005. The Sounds left their original ballpark, Herschel Greer Stadium, in 2015 for First Horizon Park, a new ballpark built on the site of the former Sulphur Dell ballpark. In 2021, they were placed in the Triple-A East, which became the International League in 2022. In total, the Sounds have won eleven division titles and three league championships.\nThe Music City Fire, an arena football team of the American Arena League began play at the Williamson County AgExpo Park in 2020.\nNashville is the home of the second-oldest continually operating racetrack in the United States, the Fairgrounds Speedway. It hosted NASCAR Winston Cup races from 1958 to 1984, NASCAR Busch Series and NASCAR Truck Series in the 1980s and 1990s, and later the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series and ARCA Racing Series.\nNashville Superspeedway is located 30 mi (48 km) southeast of Nashville in Gladeville, part of the Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Area. The track held NASCAR sanctioned events from 2001 to 2011 as well as IndyCar races from 2001 to 2008. Nashville Superspeedway will reopen in 2021 and host the premier NASCAR Cup Series for the first time.\nThe Nashville Invitational was a golf tournament on the PGA Tour from 1944 to 1946.

It is also the home of the annual Iroquois Steeplechase.\nThe United States Army Corps of Engineers maintains parks on Old Hickory Lake and Percy Priest Lake. These parks are used for activities such as fishing, water skiing, sailing and boating. The Harbor Island Yacht Club makes its headquarters on Old Hickory Lake, and Percy Priest Lake is home to the Vanderbilt Sailing Club and Nashville Shores.\nOther parks in Nashville include Centennial Park, Shelby Park, Cumberland Park, and Radnor Lake State Natural Area.\nOn August 27, 2013, Nashville mayor Karl Dean revealed plans for two new riverfront parks on the east and west banks of the Cumberland River downtown. Construction on the east bank park began in the fall of 2013, and the projected completion date for the west bank park is 2015. Among many exciting benefits of this Cumberland River re-development project is the construction of a highly anticipated outdoor amphitheater. Located on the west bank, this music venue will be surrounded by a new 12-acre (4.9 ha) park and will replace the previous thermal plant site. It will include room for 6,500 spectators with 2,500 removable seats and additional seating on an overlooking grassy knoll. In addition, the 4.5-acre (1.8 ha) east bank park will include a river landing, providing people access to the river. In regard to the parks' benefits for Nashvillian civilians, Mayor Dean remarked that \"if done right, the thermal site can be an iconic park that generations of Nashvillians will be proud of and which they can enjoy\".\n## Law and government\nThe city of Nashville and Davidson County merged in 1963 as a way for Nashville to combat the problems of urban sprawl. The combined entity is officially known as \"the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County\", and is popularly known as \"Metro Nashville\" or simply \"Metro\". It offers services such as police, fire, electricity, water and sewage treatment. When the Metro government was formed in 1963, the government was split into two service districts—the \"urban services district\" and the \"general services district.\" The urban services district encompasses the 1963 boundaries of the former City of Nashville, approximately 72 square miles (190 km2), and the general services district includes the remainder of Davidson County. There are six smaller municipalities within the consolidated city-county: Belle Meade, Berry Hill, Forest Hills, Oak Hill, Goodlettsville (partially), and Ridgetop (partially). These municipalities use a two-tier system of government, with the smaller municipality typically providing police services and the Metro Nashville government providing most other services. Previously, the city of Lakewood also had a separate charter. However, Lakewood residents voted in 2010 and 2011 to dissolve its city charter and join the metropolitan government, with both votes passing.\nNashville is governed by a mayor, vice-mayor, and 40-member Metropolitan Council. It uses the strong-mayor form of the mayor–council system. The current mayor of Nashville is John Cooper. The Metropolitan Council is the legislative body of government for Nashville and Davidson County. There are five council members who are elected at large and 35 council members that represent individual districts. The Metro Council has regular meetings that are presided over by the vice-mayor, who is currently Jim Shulman. The Metro Council meets on the first and third Tuesday of each month at 6:00 pm, according to the Metropolitan Charter.\nNashville is home to the Tennessee Supreme Court's courthouse for Middle Tennessee and the Estes Kefauver Federal Building and United States Courthouse, home of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.\n### Politics\nNashville has been a Democratic stronghold since at least the end of Reconstruction, and has remained staunchly Democratic even as the state as a whole has trended strongly Republican. Pockets of Republican influence exist in the wealthier portions of the city, but they are usually no match for the overwhelming Democratic trend in the rest of the city. The issue of school busing roiled politics for years but subsided after the 1990s. While local elections are officially nonpartisan, nearly all the city's elected officials are publicly known as Democrats. The city is split among 10 state house districts, all of which are held by Democrats. Three state senate districts and part of a fourth are within the county; three are held by Democrats and one by a Republican.\nIn the state legislature, Nashville politicians serve as leaders of both the Senate and House Democratic Caucuses. Representative Mike Stewart serves as Chairman of the House Caucus. Senator Jeff Yarbro serves as Chairman of the Senate Caucus.\nDemocrats are no less dominant at the federal level. Democratic presidential candidates have failed to carry Davidson County only five times since Reconstruction; in 1928, 1968, 1972, 1984 and 1988. In most years, Democrats have carried Nashville at the presidential level with relatively little difficulty, even in years when they lose Tennessee as a whole. This has been especially true in recent elections, as the state capitol has continued to trend more Democratic even as most of the rest of the state has become staunchly Republican. In the 2000 presidential election, Tennessean Democrat Al Gore carried Nashville with over 59% of the vote even as he narrowly lost his home state and thus the presidency. In the 2004 election, Democrat John Kerry carried Nashville with 55% of the vote while George W. Bush won the state by 14 points. In 2008, Barack Obama carried Nashville with 60% of the vote while Republican John McCain won Tennessee by 15 points.\nDespite its large size, Nashville has been in a single congressional district for most of the time since Reconstruction; it is currently the 5th District, represented by Democrat Jim Cooper, who is also the brother of Nashville's current mayor John Cooper. A Republican has not represented a significant portion of Nashville since 1874. Republicans made a few spirited challenges in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. The Republicans almost won it in 1968; only a strong showing by a candidate from Wallace's American Independent Party kept the seat in Democratic hands. However, they have not made a serious bid for the district since 1972, when the Republican candidate gained only 38% of the vote even as Nixon carried the district in the presidential election by a large margin. The district's best-known congressman was probably Jo Byrns, who represented the district from 1909 to 1936 and was Speaker of the House for much of Franklin Roosevelt's first term as president. Another nationally prominent congressman from Nashville was Percy Priest, who represented the district from 1941 to 1956 and was House Majority Whip from 1949 to 1953. Former mayors Richard Fulton and Bill Boner also sat in the U.S. House before assuming the Metro mayoral office.\nFrom 2003 to 2013, a sliver of southwestern Nashville was located in the 7th District, represented by Republican Marsha Blackburn. This area was roughly coextensive with the portion of Nashville she had represented in the state senate from 1998 to 2002. However, the 5th regained all of Nashville after the 2010 census. In the 2022 redistricting cycle, the GOP-controlled state legislature controversially split Nashville into part of the 5th, 6th, and 7th districts in an effort to gerrymander an additional Republican to Tennessee's congressional delegation.\n### Crime\nAccording to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting database, Metropolitan Nashville has a violent crime rate approximately three times the national average, and a property crime rate approximately 1.6 times the average. The following table shows Nashville's crime rate per 100,000 inhabitants for seven UCR categories.\n## Education\nThe city is served by Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, also referred to as Metro Schools. This district is the second largest school district in Tennessee, and enrolls approximately 85,000 students at 169 schools. In addition, Nashville is home to numerous private schools, including Montgomery Bell Academy, Harpeth Hall School, University School of Nashville, Lipscomb Academy, The Ensworth School, Christ Presbyterian Academy, Father Ryan High School, Pope John Paul II High School, Franklin Road Academy, Davidson Academy, Nashville Christian School, Donelson Christian Academy, and St. Cecilia Academy. Combined, all of the private schools in Nashville enroll more than 15,000 students.\n### Colleges and universities\nNashville has been labeled the \"Athens of the South\" due to the many colleges and universities in the metropolitan area. Total enrollment in post-secondary education in Nashville is around 43,000.\nThe largest is Vanderbilt University, with about 13,000 students. Vanderbilt is considered one of the nation's leading research universities and is particularly known for its medical, law, and education programs.\nNashville is home to more historically Black institutions of higher education than any other city save Atlanta, Georgia: Fisk University, Tennessee State University, Meharry Medical College, and American Baptist College.\nOther schools based in Nashville include Belmont University, Lipscomb University, Trevecca Nazarene University, John A. Gupton College. The Tennessee Board of Regents operates Nashville State Community College and the Nashville branch of the Tennessee Colleges of Applied Technology.\nOther nearby institutes of higher education include Murfreesboro's Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), a full-sized public university with Tennessee's second-largest undergraduate population; Daymar College in Franklin; and Cumberland University in Lebanon.\n## Media\nThe daily newspaper in Nashville is The Tennessean, which until 1998 competed with the Nashville Banner, another daily paper that was housed in the same building under a joint-operating agreement. The Tennessean is the city's most widely circulated newspaper. Online news service NashvillePost.com competes with the printed dailies to break local and state news. Several weekly papers are also published in Nashville, including The Nashville Pride, Nashville Business Journal, Nashville Scene and The Tennessee Tribune. Historically, The Tennessean was associated with a broadly liberal editorial policy, while The Banner carried staunchly conservative views in its editorial pages; The Banner's heritage had been carried on, to an extent, by The City Paper which folded in August 2013 after having been founded in October 2000. The Nashville Scene is the area's alternative weekly broadsheet. The Nashville Pride is aimed towards community development and serves Nashville's entrepreneurial population. Nashville Post is an online news source covering business, politics and sports.\nNashville is home to eleven broadcast television stations, although most households are served by direct cable network connections. Comcast Cable has a monopoly on terrestrial cable service in Davidson County (but not throughout the entire media market). Nashville is ranked as the 29th largest television market in the United States. Major stations include WKRN-TV 2 (ABC), WSMV-TV 4 (NBC), WTVF 5 (CBS), WNPT 8 (PBS), WTNX-LD 15 (Telemundo), WZTV 17 (Fox), WNPX-TV 28 (ion), WPGD-TV 50 (TBN), WLLC-LD 42 (Univision), WUXP-TV 30 (MyNetworkTV), (WJFB) 44 (MeTV), and WNAB 58 (CW).\nNashville is also home to cable networks Country Music Television (CMT), among others. CMT's master control facilities are located in New York City with other Viacom properties. The Top 20 Countdown and CMT Insider are taped in their Nashville studios. Shop at Home Network was once based in Nashville, but the channel signed off in 2008.\nSeveral FM and AM radio stations broadcast in the Nashville area, including five college stations and one LPFM community radio station. Nashville is ranked as the 44th largest radio market in the United States. WSM-FM is owned by Cumulus Media and is 95.5 FM. WSM-AM, owned by Gaylord Entertainment Company, can be heard nationally on 650 AM or online at WSM Online from its studios located inside the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center. WSM is famous for carrying live broadcasts of the Grand Ole Opry, through which it helped spread the popularity of country music in America, and continues to broadcast country music throughout its broadcast day. WLAC, whose over-the-air signal is heard at 1510 AM, is an iHeartMedia-owned talk station which was originally sponsored by the Life and Casualty Insurance Company of Tennessee, and its competitor WWTN is owned by Cumulus.\nSeveral major motion pictures have been filmed in Nashville, including The Green Mile, The Last Castle, Gummo, The Thing Called Love, Two Weeks, Coal Miner's Daughter, Nashville, and Country Strong, as well as the ABC television series Nashville.\n## Infrastructure\n### Transportation\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey, 78.1% of working Nashville residents commuted by driving alone, 9.8% carpooled, 2% used public transportation, and 2.2% walked. About 1.1% used all other forms of transportation, including taxicab, motorcycle, and bicycle. About 6.7% of working Nashville residents worked at home. In 2015, 7.9% of city of Nashville households were without a car; this figure decreased to 5.9% in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Nashville averaged 1.72 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8 per household.\n#### Highways\nNashville is centrally located at the crossroads of three Interstate Highways, I-40 (east-west), I-24 (northwest-southeast) and I-65 (north-south). I-40 connects the city between Memphis to the west and Knoxville to the east, I-24 connects between Clarksville to the northwest and Chattanooga to the southeast, and I-65 connects between Louisville, Kentucky to the north and Huntsville, Alabama to the south. All three of these interstate highways, which also serve the suburbs, form brief concurrencies with each other in the city, and completely encircle downtown. Interstate 440 is a bypass route connecting I-40, I-65, and I-24 south of downtown Nashville. Briley Parkway, the majority of which is a freeway, forms a bypass around the north side of the city and its interstates. Ellington Parkway, a freeway made up of a section of U.S. Route 31E, runs between east of downtown and Briley Parkway, serving as an alternative route to I-65. Interstate 840 provides an outer southern bypass for the city and its suburbs. U.S. Routes 31, 31E, 31W, 31 Alternate, 41, 41 Alternate, 70, 70S, and 431 also serve Nashville, intersecting in the city's center as arterial surface roads and radiating outward. Most of these routes are called \"pikes\" and many carry the names of nearby towns to which they lead. Among these are Clarksville Pike, Gallatin Pike, Lebanon Pike, Murfreesboro Pike, Nolensville Pike, and Franklin Pike.\n#### Public transit\nThe Metropolitan Transit Authority provides bus transit within the city. Routes utilize a hub and spoke method, centered around the Music City Central transit station in downtown. A rejected expansion plan included use of bus rapid transit and light rail service at some point in the future.\nNashville is considered a gateway city for rail and air traffic for the Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion.\n#### Air\nThe city is served by Nashville International Airport (BNA), which is operated by the Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority (MNAA). 18.27 million passengers visited the airport in 2019, making it the 31st busiest airport in the US. BNA is ranked fastest growing airport among the top 50 airports in the United States. Nashville International Airport serves 600 daily flights to more than 85 nonstop markets.\nIn late 2014, BNA became the first major U.S. airport to establish dedicated pick-up and drop-off areas for vehicle for hire companies.\nThe airport authority also operates the John C. Tune Airport, a Class E airspace general aviation airport.\n#### Intercity rail\nAlthough a major freight hub for CSX Transportation, Nashville is not currently served by Amtrak, the third-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. to have this distinction. Nashville's Union Station had once been a major intercity passenger rail center for the Louisville and Nashville Railroad; Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway; and the Tennessee Central Railway, reaching Midwestern cities and cities on the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. However, by the time of Amtrak's founding, service had been cut back to a single train, the Floridian, which ran from Chicago to Miami and St. Petersburg, Florida. It served Union Station until its cancellation on October 9, 1979, due to poor track conditions resulting in late trains and low ridership, ending over 120 years of intercity rail service in Nashville.\nWhile there have been few proposals to restore Amtrak service to Nashville, there have been repeated calls from residents. In addition to scarce federal funding, Tennessee state officials do not believe that Nashville is large enough to support intercity rail. \"It would be wonderful to say I can be in Memphis and jump on a train to Nashville, but the volume of people who would do that isn't anywhere close to what the cost would be to provide the service,\" said Ed Cole, chief of environment and planning with the Tennessee Department of Transportation. Ross Capon, executive director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers, said rail trips would catch on if routes were expanded, but conceded that it would be nearly impossible to resume Amtrak service to Nashville without a substantial investment from the state. However, in 2020, Amtrak indicated it was considering a service that would run from Atlanta to Nashville by way of Chattanooga.\nNashville launched a passenger commuter rail system called the Music City Star on September 18, 2006. The only currently operational leg of the system connects the city of Lebanon to downtown Nashville at the Nashville Riverfront station. Legs to Clarksville, Murfreesboro and Gallatin are currently in the feasibility study stage. The system plan includes seven legs connecting Nashville to surrounding suburbs.\n#### Bridges\nBridges within the city include:\n### Utilities\nThe city of Nashville owns the Nashville Electric Service (NES), Metro Water Services (MWS) and Nashville District Energy System (NDES). The Nashville Electric Service provides electricity to the entirety of Davidson County and small portions of the six adjacent counties, and purchases its power from the Tennessee Valley Authority. Metro Water Services provides water, wastewater, and stormwater to Nashville and the majority of Davidson County, as well as water services to small portions of Rutherford and Williamson counties, and wastewater services to small portions of all of the surrounding counties except for Cheatham County. MWS sources its water from the Cumberland River and operates two water treatment plants and three wastewater treatment plants. Ten additional utility companies provide water and sewer service to Nashville and Davidson County. The Nashville District Energy System provides heating and cooling services to certain buildings in downtown, including multiple government buildings. Natural gas is provided by Piedmont Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Duke Energy.\n### Healthcare\nAs a major center for the healthcare industry, Nashville is home to several hospitals and other primary care facilities. Most hospitals in Nashville are operated by Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the TriStar Division of Hospital Corporation of America, and Saint Thomas Health. The Metropolitan Nashville Hospital Authority operates Nashville General Hospital, which is affiliated with Meharry Medical College.\n## Sister cities\nNashville's sister cities are:\nGwangjin (Seoul), South Korea\nCrouy, France"], "selected_questions": ["Who was Nashville named after?", "How many smaller municipalities are included in the consolidated city-county government of Nashville?", "Which three professional sports teams are based in Nashville?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Nashville was named after Francis Nash, a general of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.", "There are six smaller municipalities that are included in the consolidated city-county government of Nashville.", "The three professional sports teams based in Nashville are the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League (NFL), the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL), and Nashville SC of Major League Soccer (MLS)."], "InternLM_answers": ["Nashville was named after General Francis Nash who was a general in the American Revolutionary War.

{"name": "Harpers Ferry, West Virginia", "documents": ["# Harpers Ferry, West Virginia\nHarpers Ferry is a historic town in Jefferson County, West Virginia, United States, in the lower Shenandoah Valley. The population was 285 at the 2020 census. Situated at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers, where the U.S. states of Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia meet, it is the easternmost town in West Virginia and during the American Civil War was the northernmost point of Confederate-controlled territory. It has been called \"the best strategic point in the whole South.\"\nThe town was formerly spelled Harper's Ferry with an apostrophe, so named because in the 18th century it was the site of a ferry service owned and operated by Robert Harper. The United States Board on Geographic Names, whose Domestic Name Committee is reluctant to include apostrophes in official place names, established the standard spelling of \"Harpers Ferry\" by 1891.\nBy far, the most important event in the town's history was John Brown's raid on the Harpers Ferry Armory in 1859.\nPrior to the American Civil War, Harpers Ferry was a manufacturing town as well as a major transportation hub. (See Virginius Island and Harpers Ferry Armory.)\nThe main economic activity in the town in the 20th and 21st centuries is tourism. John Brown's Fort is the most visited tourist site in the state of West Virginia. The headquarters of the Appalachian Trail are there—not the midpoint, but close to it, and easily accessible—and the buildings of the former Storer College are used by the National Park Service for one of its four national training centers. The National Park Service is Harpers Ferry's largest employer in the 21st century.\nThe lower town has been reconstructed by the National Park Service. It was in ruins by the end of the American Civil War, not helped by later river flooding.: 15  \"The fact that Harpers Ferry was first and foremost an industrial village during the 19th century is not apparent in the sights, sounds, or smells of the town today.\": 10 \n## Geography\nThe geographical and physical features of Harpers Ferry were the principal reasons for its settlement and eventual industrial development. It is a natural transportation hub and a major river, the Shenandoah, joins the Potomac River at Harpers Ferry. It guarded the entrance to Virginia's large Shenandoah Valley, and the Potomac provided easy access to Washington. The valleys of the rivers made it possible to build the never-completed Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, then the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and shortly after that the Winchester and Potomac Railroad. The first railroad junction in the United States was at Harpers Ferry. Essential telegraph lines passed through the town.\nThe armory, and later other industries, were located in Harpers Ferry because of the abundant water power available from the rivers.\nThe ferry ended in 1824, when a covered wooden road bridge by the name of Wager's Bridge was built. Harpers Ferry was the site of the first and for many years the only railroad bridge across the Potomac River, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's bridge, built in 1836–37. None of Washington, D.C.'s bridges connecting it with Virginia carried more than horse traffic until after the American Civil War. In 1851, a second bridge was built, across the Shenandoah, one of the earliest Bollman trusses.: 67  A newer Bollman truss bridge, which carried both rail and highway traffic, opened in 1870 but was washed away in a flood in 1936.\nThe town's original lower section is on a flood plain created by the two rivers. It is surrounded by higher ground, and since the 20th century has been part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park. Most of the remainder, which includes the more elevated populated area, is included in the separate Harpers Ferry Historic District. Two other National Register of Historic Places properties adjoin the town: the B & O Railroad Potomac River Crossing and St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church.\nThe Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) headquarters is in Harpers Ferry. The Appalachian Trail passes directly through town, which some consider the psychological midpoint of the trail although the exact physical midpoint is farther north, in Pennsylvania. Uniquely, the towns of Harpers Ferry and adjoining Bolivar Heights partnered with the ATC to be declared a united Appalachian Trail Community. Other popular outdoor activities in the area include white water rafting, fishing, mountain biking, tubing, canoeing, hiking, zip lining, and rock climbing.\n## History\n### 18th century\nIn 1733, Peter Stephens, a squatter, settled on land near \"The Point\" (the area where the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers meet) and established a ferry from Virginia (now West Virginia) to Maryland, across the Potomac.\n### Robert Harper\nRobert Harper, from whom the town takes its name, was born in 1718 in Oxford Township, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Since he was a builder, Harper was asked by a group of Quakers in 1747 to build a meeting house in the Shenandoah Valley near the present site of Winchester, Virginia. Traveling through Maryland on his way to the Shenandoah Valley, Harper—who was also a millwright—realized the potential of the latent waterpower from the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers at an easily accessible location. He paid Stephens 30 guineas for his squatting rights to the ferry, since the land actually belonged to Lord Fairfax.: 12 \nHarper then purchased 126 acres (0.51 km2) of land from Lord Fairfax in 1751. In 1761, the Virginia General Assembly granted him the right to establish and maintain a ferry across the Potomac, even though a ferry had already been functioning since before Harper arrived. In 1763, the Virginia General Assembly established the town of \"Shenandoah Falls at Mr. Harpers Ferry.\": 100  Harper died in October 1782 and is buried in the Harper Cemetery.\n### Thomas Jefferson\nOn October 25, 1783, Thomas Jefferson visited Harpers Ferry as he was traveling to Philadelphia and passed through Harpers Ferry with his daughter Patsy. Viewing \"the passage of the Potomac through the Blue Ridge\" from a rock that is now named for him as Jefferson's Rock, he called the site \"perhaps one of the most stupendous scenes in nature\": 22  and stated, \"This scene is worth a voyage across the Atlantic.\" The town was one of his favorite retreats, and tradition says that much of his Notes on the State of Virginia was written there. Jefferson County, in which Harpers Ferry is located was named for him on its creation in 1801.\n### George Washington\nGeorge Washington, as president of the Patowmack Company (which was formed to complete river improvements on the Potomac and its tributaries), traveled to Harpers Ferry during the summer of 1785 to determine the need for bypass canals. Following Washington's familiarity with the area led him to propose the site in 1794 for a new United States armory and arsenal, some of his family moved to the area: his brother Charles Washington, who founded the nearby Jefferson County town of Charles Town, and his great-great-nephew, Colonel Lewis Washington, who was held hostage during John Brown's raid in 1859.: 13 \n## 19th century\n### The federal armory\nIn 1796, the federal government purchased a 125-acre (0.5 km2) parcel of land from the heirs of Robert Harper. Construction began on what would become the United States Armory and Arsenal at Harpers Ferry in 1799. It is referred to locally as both \"the armory\" and \"the arsenal,\" but it is the same facility. This was the second of only two such facilities in the United States, the first being in Springfield, Massachusetts. Together they produced most of the small arms for the U.S. Army. The town was transformed into a water-powered industrial center. Between 1801 and 1861, when the armory was destroyed to prevent capture during the American Civil War, it produced more than 600,000 muskets, rifles, and pistols. Inventor Captain John H. Hall pioneered the use of interchangeable parts in firearms manufactured at his rifle works at the armory between 1820 and 1840. His M1819 Hall rifle was the first breech-loading weapon adopted by the U.S. Army.: 151 \n### Canals\nHarpers Ferry's first man-made transportation facility was the Potomac Canal. The canal ceased transportation in 1828, but a portion of it in front of the town channeled river water to run machinery for the armory.\nThe Potomac Canal ran on the Virginia side of the river. On the Maryland side, the later Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad competed for right-of-way on a very narrow patch of land downstream from Harpers Ferry.\n### Arrival of the railroads\nIndustrialization continued in 1833 when the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal reached Harpers Ferry, linking it with Washington, D.C., on the canal's western expansion to Ohio that was, however, never completed. A year later, after a protracted dispute with the Canal company the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad began service from Harpers Ferry via the Wager Bridge, named for the same family that later built the Wager Hotel across from Harpers Ferry's B&O train station. The bridge connected the town across the Potomac with Sandy Hook, Maryland, which for a few years in the 1830s was the western terminus of the railroad. The railroad crossed the Potomac into Harpers Ferry with the opening of the B & O Railroad Potomac River Crossing in 1837.\nThe first railroad junction in the country began service in 1836 when the Winchester and Potomac Railroad opened its line from Harpers Ferry southwest to Charles Town and then to Winchester, Virginia.\n### Virginius Island\nThis island, connected by a small bridge across the Shenandoah River to the lower part of Harpers Ferry, was created \"by happenstance\" in the early 1800s after the digging of the Shenandoah Canal, when debris floated down from upstream mills. Cotton and flour mills and other water-powered industry were built on Virginius Island, taking advantage of the Shenandoah River’s water power and good routes to markets. The island came to house all of Harpers Ferry's manufacturing except for the armory—which, although it used the Potomac River for power—also built a rifle plant some distance upstream using the Shenandoah's power.\nVirginius Island also provided working-class housing at a boarding house and in row houses. At the island’s population height just prior to the American Civil War, there were some 180 residents. Although no intact structure survives because 20th-century floods destroyed everything, many visitors are attracted to view Virginius Island's historic ruins as well as walk National Park Service trails.\n### John Brown's raid\nOn October 16, 1859, the abolitionist John Brown led a group of 22 men (counting himself) in a raid on the armory. Five of the men were black: three free black men, one freed slave, and one fugitive slave. Brown attacked and captured several buildings, hoping to secure the weapons depot and arm the slaves, starting a revolt across the South. Brown also brought 1,000 steel pikes, which were forged in Connecticut by a blacksmith and abolitionist sympathizer, Charles Blair; however, the pikes, a weapon that does not require training, were never used as Brown failed to rally the slaves to revolt. The first shot of the raid mortally wounded Heyward Shepherd, a free black man who was a baggage porter for the B&O Railroad.\nThe noise from that shot alerted Dr. John Starry shortly after 1 am. He walked from his nearby home to investigate the shooting and was confronted by Brown's men. Starry stated that he was a doctor but could do nothing more for Shepherd, and the men allowed him to leave. Starry then went to the livery and rode to neighboring towns and villages, alerting residents to the raid. John Brown's men were quickly pinned down by local citizens and militia, and forced to take refuge in the fire engine house (later called John Brown's Fort), at the entrance to the armory.\nThe Secretary of War asked the Navy Department for a unit of United States Marines from the Washington Navy Yard, the nearest troops. Lieutenant Israel Greene was ordered to take a force of 86 Marines to the town. U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee was found on leave at his home not far away in Arlington, Virginia, and was assigned as commander, along with Lt. J. E. B. Stuart as his aide-de-camp. Lee led the unit in civilian clothes, as none of his uniforms were available. The contingent arrived by train on October 18, and after negotiations failed, they stormed the fire house and captured most of the raiders, killing a few and suffering a single casualty. Lee submitted a report on October 19.\nBrown was quickly tried in Charles Town, county seat of Jefferson County, for treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, murder, and fomenting a slave insurrection. Convicted of all charges, with Starry's testimony integral to the conviction, he was hanged December 2, 1859. (See Virginia v. John Brown.) John Brown's words, both from his interview by Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise and his famous last speech, \"captured the attention of the nation like no other abolitionist or slave owner before or since.\": 174 \n### American Civil War\nThe American Civil War was disastrous for Harpers Ferry, which changed hands eight times between 1861 and 1865. One of the first military actions take by secessionists in Virginia was taken on April 18, 1861, when they wrested control of the Federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry from the Union Army, even before the convention which would consider whether or not the state should secede had even been called together.\nBecause of the town's strategic location on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and at the northern end of the Shenandoah Valley, both Union and Confederate troops moved through Harpers Ferry frequently. It was said that \"Jefferson County is where the North and South met.\" It was a natural conduit for Confederate invasions of the North, as in General Robert E. Lee's Maryland campaign of 1862, and his Gettysburg campaign of 1863, and Federal troops heading south in their attempts to thwart Rebel forces in the Valley which threatened Washington, D.C.\nThe town was \"easy to seize, and hard to hold\",: 284  because of its topography: surrounded on three sides by high ground – Bolivar Heights to the west, Loudoun Heights to the south, and Maryland Heights to the east – and surrounded by the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers, anyone who controlled the heights controlled the city.\nThe effect on the town was devastating. It was described in March 1862:\nHarper's Ferry presents quite a gloomy picture. The best buildings have been shelled to the ground, and nothing now remains but their foundations to mark the spot where they once stood. The old Arsenal has been burnt to the ground; that part of the building where old John Brown made such a fatal stand, still stands as a monument to his memory. Before the destruction of the town, it contained near 3000 inhabitants, but at the present time there are not more than 300 or 400 families there.\nJohn G. Rosengarten described it in similar terms, saying that Harpers Ferry and the companion town of Bolivar, in 1859 \"a blooming garden-spot, full of thrift and industry and comfort,\" had been reduced to \"waste and desolation\" in 1862.\nThe town's garrison of federal troops attracted 1,500 contrabands (escaped slaves) by the summer of 1862. They were returned to slavery, however, when Confederate General Stonewall Jackson took Harpers Ferry in September 1862, as the town played a key role in the Confederate invasion of Maryland.\nLee needed to control Harpers Ferry because it was on his supply line and could cut off his possible routes of retreat if the invasion did not go well.\nTherefore. Lee divided his army of approximately 40,000 into four sections, sending three columns under Jackson to surround and capture the town.\nThe Battle of Harpers Ferry started with light fighting September 13 as the Confederates tried to capture the Maryland Heights to the northeast, while John Walker moved back over the Potomac to capture Loudoun Heights south of town. After a Confederate artillery bombardment on September 14 and 15, the federal garrison surrendered. With Jackson's capture of 12,419 federal troops, the surrender at Harpers Ferry was the largest surrender of U.S. military personnel until the Battle of Bataan in World War II.\nBecause of the delay in capturing the town and the movement of federal forces to the west, Lee was forced to regroup at the town of Sharpsburg. Two days later he commanded troops in the Battle of Antietam, which had the highest number of deaths among troops of any single day in United States military history.\nBy July 1864, the Union again had control of Harpers Ferry. On July 4, 1864, the Union commanding general, Franz Sigel, withdrew his troops to Maryland Heights, from which he resisted Jubal Anderson Early's attempt to enter the town and drive out the federal garrison.\n### After the Civil War\nInspired by John Brown, both runaway and freed slaves came to Harpers Ferry during and after the American Civil War. This created social tensions between white and black residents of the community and generated a growing need for services for the increasing African-American population. Accordingly, a freedman’s school was opened on Camp Hill by Freewill Baptist missionaries following the American Civil War.: 4 \n### Storer College\nThe town and the armory, except John Brown's Fort, were destroyed during the American Civil War. \"The larger portion of the houses all lie in ruins and the whole place is not actually worth $10,\" wrote a Massachusetts soldier to his mother in 1863.: 285  A visitor in 1878 found the town \"antiquated, dingy, and rather squalid\"; another, in 1879, described it as \"shabby and ruined.\": 286  Since the Arsenal had been Harpers Ferry's largest employer but was never rebuilt, the population never recovered to pre-Civil War levels.\nStorer College, devoted to training teachers for freedmen, opened in 1868, much to the displeasure of many residents of Harpers Ferry who petitioned the Legislature to revoke its charter. The War Department gave the Freedmen's Bureau its remaining assets in Harpers Ferry, principally four sturdy residences for the managers of the Armory, structurally sound but in need of repairs from damage during the war, and the Bureau gave them to Storer College. A one-man school for Blacks was already operating in one of them.\n### African-American tourism\nIn 1859 Harpers Ferry became a town of great historical importance to African-Americans, where the end of slavery began, as Frederick Douglass put it. With good rail connections to major eastern cities, it became a destination as soon as railroad operations returned to normal after the war. As described in a newspaper in 1873: \"One need only to alight from the train and look a little envious toward the old Engine House or the ruined walls of the old Arsenal in order to have a score of persons offering to become a kind of guide or to point out to your whatever you may desire to know about the great struggle which ended in the 'opening of the prison doors, the breaking of every yoke, the undoing of heavy burdens, and letting the oppressed go free.\"\nStorer, the only Black college at a location historically important to African-Americans, became a civil rights center and made the town even more of a destination for Black tourists and excursionists. Frederick Douglass spoke in 1881, as part of an unsuccessful campaign to fund a \"John Brown professorship\" to be held by an African American. It was at Storer that the Niagara Movement, the predecessor of the NAACP, met for the first time in the United States in 1906 after its earlier organizational meeting in Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada, .\nThe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad wanted the land where the fort was located so as to make the line less vulnerable to flooding, and some white townspeople were eager to get rid of it;: 181 : 19  it was dismantled and moved to Chicago for display at the 1893 Columbian Exposition. Abandoned there, it was rescued and moved back to Harpers Ferry by the Baltimore and Ohio without charge, motivated by their expectation that having the fort back in Harpers Ferry would be a tourist attraction and a way to build ridership on the railroad.: 183  Most whites were opposed to any commemoration of John Brown, however,: 182  and so for lack of a better location it was placed on a nearby farm.\nNow Harpers Ferry, easily accessible by rail, began its conversion to its new industry: tourism. Many African-Americans visited Harpers Ferry. There was a Black-owned hotel to accommodate them, the Hilltop House, built and run by a Storer graduate, Thomas Leavitt. In the summer Storer rented rooms to Black vacationers until 1896.: 183  The fort was the great monument where the end of slavery began. There were so many tourists that they were a nuisance to the farmer on whose lands the fort sat, and so it was moved to Storer in 1909. There it would remain until several years after the college closed in 1955, functioning as the College Museum. Male students practiced their public speaking skills by giving tours of it.\nVisits by tourists, many of them Black, now began to slowly turn the town into a real tourist center. As early as 1878 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was running excursion trains to Harpers Ferry from Baltimore and Washington. Tourism was cited as a reason for the town's recovering population growth. \"Harpers Ferry proved to be one of the most visited places of leisure for nineteenth-century African Americans.\": 41–42 \n#### Island Park Resort and Amusement Park\nTo increase ridership, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad built a park in 1879 called Island Park Resort and Amusement Park on Byrne Island in the Potomac, which the railroad bought and built a footbridge to reach it. One had to pay 5¢ ($5 in 2021 value) to cross and enter, after which rides and other activities were free.. It was a site for outings and church picnics, and suitable also for holding political rallies by the railroad as a perk for its employees. (See also Relay, Maryland.) A list of events held there would be long, but as examples there was a reunion of 4,000 Odd Fellows in 1880 and a \"Grand Tri-State Democratic Mass Meeting\" 1892.\nThe park was large enough that parades could be held. There were a steam-powered ferris wheel and carousel, a midway, a pavilion for dancing or roller skating, swings, a merry-go-round, and a bandstand. Visitors could also play croquet, tennis, rent boats, fish, or wade in the river. Later there were baseball games. Blacks and whites attended on different days.: 73 In 1883, there were an estimated 100,000 visitors.: 50  There were six special trains to Harpers Ferry from various points.\nFor three decades the park operated but was closed in 1909 after many flood repairs. However, the B & O kept the park open even after that for picnicking.\nThe bandstand, the only surviving structure, has been moved twice. At the park's closing, it was moved to Arsenal Square (the current location of John Brown's Fort), then later to the park at Washington and Gilmore Streets. It is referred to as The Bandstand or the Town Gazebo, and many civic, cultural, and recreational activities take place there.\nThe bridge was destroyed by flooding in 1896, and a rebuilt bridge in 1924. Remaining structures on the island were destroyed by flooding in 1942.\n### 20th century\n#### 2nd Niagara Movement Conference\nOn August 15, 1906, Black author and scholar W. E. B. Du Bois led the first meeting on American soil of the newly-founded Niagara Movement – so-named because it had initially met in Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada on the Niagara River – on the campus of Storer College, a primarily Black college that operated until 1955. (After it closed, the campus became part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park.) The three-day gathering, which was held to work for civil rights for African Americans, was later described by DuBois as \"one of the greatest meetings that American Negroes ever held\" Attendees of the 1906 meeting walked from Storer College to the farm of the Murphy family, the location at the time of John Brown's historic \"fort,\" the armory's firehouse. As a direct result, the fort was soon moved to the Storer campus, where it became the college's central icon. After the college closed in 1955, the National Park Service moved it back to as close as possible to its original location.\n#### Harpers Ferry National Monument and National Historical Park\nThe combined effects of American Civil War damage and flooding left lower Harpers Ferry in poor condition. The later devastating effects of the 1936 flood left the lower town \"shabby and almost uninhabited\", with no bridge across the Shenandoah to Virginia and no highway bridge to Maryland. All remaining structures on Virginius Island were destroyed.\nThe backbone of the effort to preserve and commemorate Harpers Ferry was Henry T. MacDonald, President of Storer, an amateur historian appointed by West Virginia Governor Okey Patteson as head of the Harpers Ferry National Monument Commission.: 45  He was assisted by the Representative from West Virginia's Second District, Jennings Randolph, who in 1935 introduced a bill to establish Harpers Ferry National Military Park in \"the area where the most important events of  took place.: 35–36  Although this bill did not pass, the flood of 1936 made the project more feasible by destroying buildings not historically important ad thus freeing land. After several other attempts, a bill creating Harpers Ferry National Monument was passed and signed by President Roosevelt in 1944, subject to the proviso that nothing would be done with it until the war ended.: 39 \nAn urgent priority was the new highway, which is today U.S. Route 340. A new bridge connecting Sandy Hook, Maryland with Loudoun County, Virginia opened in October 1947, on which work had begun in 1941 but was interrupted by the war. Another new bridge over the Shenandoah connecting Virginia to Bolivar Heights, West Virginia, opened two years later. Federal highway traffic now bypassed Harpers Ferry entirely.\nLand acquisition started in lower Harpers Ferry; the project was supported both by Harpers Ferry mayor Gilbert Perry and Governor Patteson. Twenty-two eviction notices were served in the lower town, and two taverns closed.: 57 Property acquisition, not all of which was unproblematic, was completed in 1952 and presented to the United States in January 1953.: 46  The National Monument's first on-site employee, John T. Willett, began work in 1954.\nIn 1957 the Baltimore Sun said that the lower town was \"a sagging and rotted ghost town.\" The idea of making Harpers Ferry into a National Monument was to prevent the further deterioration and to rebuild the tourist industry. The first task of the Park Service was to stabilize the buildings on Shenandoah Street, the main commercial street of lower Harpers Ferry. Roofs were covered, missing windows replaced, walls on the verge of collapse reinforced, and debris removed. Post-1859 buildings were not restored, and most were removed. The NPS built a Visitor's Center and a John Brown Museum. Harpers Ferry National Monument became Harpers Ferry National Historical Park on May 29, 1963.\n\"Recreationists\" who wanted a park and did not care about the history were a problem. Local residents did not want to lose recreational opportunities, but swimming and fishing on the Shenandoah shore, formerly common, were prohibited. In order to keep recreationists out of the historic area, and especially Virginius Island, John Brown's Fort was moved to Arsenal Square from a now-inconvenient location on the former Storer College campus, parking in the lower town was prohibited, and a shuttle bus service begun.: 62  Tensions between the NPS and town residents were ongoing. However, the NPS helped the town achieve Main Street Status from the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 2001.: 64 \nThe population of Harpers Ferry continued to decline in the 20th century. The majority of the surviving homes in Harpers Ferry are historic. Some are registered in the National Register of Historic Places.\n### 21st century\nOn July 23, 2015, a fire broke out in downtown Harpers Ferry, destroying eight or nine businesses and two apartments in two historic buildings. The buildings are being rebuilt.\nIn the early morning of December 21, 2019, multiple cars of a train owned by CSX derailed from the railroad bridge crossing the Potomac River. The derailment damaged a portion of the Goodloe E. Byron Memorial Pedestrian Walkway, which is attached to the railroad bridge and connects the Appalachian Trail between West Virginia and Maryland. Although the accident did not result in any injuries or fatalities, it effectively inhibited all pedestrian access across the Potomac. The bridge reopened in early July 2020.\n#### The Hilltop House project\nThe Hilltop House Hotel, which had opened in 1888 to accommodate African Americans as the sole hotel in Harpers Ferry that would accept them as guests, burned in 1911. It was rebuilt on a grander scale, but that building also burned in 1919. It was rebuilt a second time on a slightly smaller scale but closed in 2008. As of 2021, developers plan to demolish it and build a new 120-room hotel on the site.\n#### The China Folk House Retreat\nJohn Flower, director of the Sidwell Friends School Chinese Studies Program, dismantled a Chinese folk house from Yunnan and rebuilt it in Harpers Ferry with his students. For this project, Flower and his wife Pamela Leonard formed a non-profit organization, the China Folk House Retreat.\n## Archaeology\nUnder the auspices of the National Park Service, the archaeology of the town of Harpers Ferry as well as that of Virginius Island have been studied in depth. The journal Historical Archaeology published its entire volume 28, no. 4, issue of 1994 on Harpers Ferry.\n## Transportation\n### Roads and highways\nThe only significant highway providing access to Harpers Ferry is U.S. Route 340. Although signed north-south, the road runs generally eastward from Harpers Ferry across the northern tip of Loudoun County, Virginia after crossing the Shenandoah River, then quickly crosses the Potomac River into Maryland, eventually reaching its terminus at Frederick. To the west, U.S. Route 340 passes through Charles Town before turning southwest and traversing the eastern edge of Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. Harpers Ferry and Bolivar Heights host an unsigned alternate route of U.S. Route 340, which follows Washington Street, High Street, and Shenandoah Street.\n### Rail\nAmtrak provides service to Harpers Ferry two times a day—once in each direction–on the Capitol Limited. It is also served by MARC on the Brunswick Line. The city's passenger rail station is at the West Virginia end of the historic railroad bridge across the Potomac River.

{"name": "Cartagena, Spain", "documents": ["# Cartagena, Spain\nCartagena (Spanish pronunciation: ) is a Spanish city and a major naval station on the Mediterranean coast, south-eastern Iberia. As of January 2018, it has a population of 218,943 inhabitants, being the region's second-largest municipality and the country's sixth-largest non-provincial-capital city. The metropolitan area of Cartagena, known as Campo de Cartagena, has a population of 409,586 inhabitants.\nCartagena has been inhabited for over two millennia, being founded around 227 BC by the Carthaginian Hasdrubal the Fair as Qart Hadasht (Phoenician: 𐤒𐤓𐤕𐤟𐤇𐤃𐤔𐤕 QRT𐤟ḤDŠT; meaning \"New Town\"), the same name as the original city of Carthage. The city had its heyday during the Roman Empire, when it was known as Carthago Nova (the New Carthage) and Carthago Spartaria, capital of the province of Carthaginensis.\nMuch of the historical significance of Cartagena stemmed from its coveted defensive port, one of the most important in the western Mediterranean. Cartagena has been the capital of the Spanish Navy's Maritime Department of the Mediterranean since the arrival of the Spanish Bourbons in the 18th century. As far back as the 16th century it was one of the most important naval ports in Spain, together with Ferrol in the North. It is still an important naval seaport, the main military haven of Spain, and is home to a large naval shipyard.\nThe confluence of civilizations as well as its strategic harbour, together with the rise of the local mining industry is manifested by a unique artistic heritage, with a number of landmarks such as the Roman Theatre, the second largest of the Iberian Peninsula after the one in Mérida, an abundance of Phoenician, Roman, Byzantine and Moorish remains, and a plethora of Art Nouveau buildings, a result of the bourgeoisie from the early 20th century. Cartagena is now established as a major cruise ship destination in the Mediterranean and an emerging cultural focus.\nIt was the first of a number of cities that have been named Cartagena, most notably Cartagena, Colombia.\n## Geography and climate\n### Geography and relief\nThe city of Cartagena is located in the southeastern region of Spain in the Campo de Cartagena. The Cartagena region can be viewed as a great plain inclined slightly in the direction NW-SE, bordered at the north and the northwest by pre-coastal mountain ranges (Carrascoy, El Puerto, Los Villares, Columbares and Escalona), and at the south and southwest by coastal mountain ranges (El Algarrobo, La Muela, Pelayo, Gorda, La Fausilla y Minera, with its last spurs in Cape Palos).\nThe dominant geology of the region is metamorphic (slate, marble) and sedimentary (limestone). The most widely present kind of soil is calcic xerosol. Other soils that occur in the municipality are the leptosol, which forms the Mediterranean coast, and the petrocalcic xerosol.\nThe city is located just at the end of the new AP-7 motorway. The following villages are part of Cartagena municipality: La Azohía, Isla Plana, Los Urrutias and Los Nietos.\nThe Old Town is limited by five small hills (Molinete, Monte Sacro, Monte de San José, Despeñaperros and Monte de la Concepción) following the example of Rome. In the past, there was an inner sea between the hills called the Estero that eventually dried up. On this site, the \"Ensanche\" (Expansion or New Town) was built at the beginning of the 20th century.\nThe urban area is delimited or crossed by several watercourses, some of which go deep into the urban network during a large part of their courses.\n### Climate\nCartagena has a hot semi-arid climate. Its location near the sea moderates the temperature, and annual precipitation typically does not surpass 300 mm (12 in). The annual average temperature goes up to around 18.8 °C (66 °F). The coldest month is January, with an average temperature of 11.9 °C (53 °F). In August, the warmest month, the average temperature is 26.5 °C (80 °F). The wind is an important climatic factor in the region.\n### Human geography\nThe municipality has 24 districts, known as diputaciones (councils). The origin of this administrative structure has its date in the beginning of the 18th century when population was increasing and the municipality was becoming less tractable. The districts are:\nCartagena Casco: This is the district where the main town (also named Cartagena) is placed and is located in the south of the municipality. Its population consisted of 57,001 in 2019. San Antonio Abad: It is located in the south of the municipality and adjoins Cartagena Casco in its south and Canteras in its west. The number of inhabitants was 44,882 in 2019. El Plan: It adjoins La Magdalena in its west and Lentiscar in its east. There were 35,974 residents in 2019. Rincón de San Ginés: It is located in the southeast end of the municipality. Its population consisted of 10,214 people in the year 2019.

Los Médicos: It is placed in the northern half of the territory. The district shares borders with La Palma and Pozo Estrecho in its north. Escombreras: It is located in the south of Cartagena. There were 9 people living in the area in the year 2019.\n## Environment\nDespite the intense mining, tourist and industrial exploitation that the area has suffered for centuries, the territory around Cartagena city hosts an extraordinary natural wealth and diversity, with a large number of botanical endemic species. Part of its area is subject to different levels of legal protection.\n### Flora\nCartagena's coastal mountains have one of the highest levels of botanical biodiversity on the Iberian Peninsula. A number of surprising Ibero-African species, which are only found in southern Spain (mostly in the provinces of Murcia and Almería) and North Africa. Among these, there stands out Tetraclinis articulata or Sandarac (sabina mora o ciprés de Cartagena—Cartagena's cypress in Spanish) native to Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Malta, and Cartagena, growing at relatively low altitudes in a hot, dry Mediterranean woodland. Some species are seriously endangered like the siempreviva de Cartagena (Limonium carthaginense), the rabogato del Mar Menor (Sideritis marmironensis), the zamarrilla de Cartagena (Teucrium carthaginense), the manzanilla de Escombreras (Anthemis chrysantha), the garbancillo de Tallante (Astragalus nitidiflorus) and the jara de Cartagena Cistus heterophyllus carthaginensis).\n### Fauna\nAmong the animal species includes some threatened or endangered ones like the peregrine falcon, the Eurasian eagle-owl, the golden eagle and the Bonelli's eagle, the Spur-thighed tortoise, the Greater Horseshoe Bat and, especially, the Spanish toothcarp, a fish endemic to south-eastern Spain. In addition, the presence of the common chameleon (the only chameleon in Europe) has been documented for about 30 years, although it is not clear whether it is native or introduced. Some other species of note include the greater flamingo, the red fox, the European rabbit, the European badger, the Beech marten, the common genet, the wildcat and the wild boar.\n### Protected areas\nMar Menor, a salty lagoon separated from the Mediterranean Sea by a sand bar 22 kilometres (14 miles) in length and with a variable width from 100 to 1,200 metres (328 to 3,937 feet). It has a surface area of nearly 170 km2 (66 sq mi), a coastal length of 70 km (43 mi), and warm and clear water with relatively high salinity, which does not exceed 7 metres (23 feet) in depth. It belongs to four municipalities, including Cartagena. In 1994, it was included on the list of the Ramsar Convention (nº706) for the conservation and sustainable utilization of wetlands. It is also one of the Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMI) by the United Nations. Its five volcanic islands (Perdiguera, Mayor or del Barón, del Ciervo, Redonda and del Sujeto) just like El Carmolí and San Ginés hills, the Hita and Amoladora beaches, the Lo Poyo salt marsh and the salt mines of Marchamalo are protected as well. Calblanque, Monte de las Cenizas and Peña del Águila, declared a Natural Park and Site of Community Importance (SCI). It is located in the south-east of the municipality. Sierra de la Muela, Cabo Tiñoso and Roldán mountain, Natural Park, Site of Community Importance and Special Protection Area (SPA). It occurs in the south-west of the municipality. Sierra de la Fausilla, Special Protection Area. It is placed in the south of Escombreras district and between Cartagena and Calblanque Regional Park. Islands and Islets of the Mediterranean coast, including Grossa Island (belonging to the municipality of San Javier, Hormigas Islands, Palomas Islands and Escombreras Islands, some of them also designed as Special Protection Area.\n## History\n### Prehistory\nThere is mention of the presence of individuals belonging to the genus Homo in the cave Cueva Victoria 1,300,000 years ago. This cave is located in the southeastern quarter of Cartagena.\nRemains of Neanderthal individuals of the Mousterian culture were found in the Cave of Los Aviones. This place is located close to Cartagena. There were also remains of Neanderthals belonging to the Mousterian culture in the cave Cueva Bermeja, which is placed in the southwestern quarter of the municipality.\nAt the southeast corner of the municipality remains of humans of the Upper Paleolithic were discovered. The paleonthological sites are the Abrigo de Los Déntoles cove, the Cueva de Los Mejillones cave, and the Cabezo de San Ginés (hill). The West of the municipality was also the scene of human activity in that period. Concrete evidence of this are the Cueva del Caballo and Cueva Bermeja caves.\nThe southeast end of Cartagena was inhabited again during the Mesolithic. Important spots are the Cueva de Los Pájaros and Cueva de Los Mejillones (caves). Neolithic components such as ceramic remains were located.\nThe southeast of Cartagena was again inhabited during the Neolithic. The sites are Las Amoladeras and Calblanque. The south of the Alumbres district was also inhabited during that period. The archaeological site is located in the Cerro del Gorguel hill and in it a characteristic Neolithic hamlet was discovered.\nThe reasons for the dearth of human presence and structures in this municipality during the Neolithic period were the lack of rainfall and the absence of water beds. During the Bronze Age there was a similar situation.\nThe Argaric civilization inhabited the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula (Región de Murcia and Almería) during the Bronze Age. Nevertheless, they did not significantly occupy this municipality, there were few structures belonging to them and they had little relevance here. They lived in the northwest.\n### Ancient history\nThe town was originally named Mastia. Possessing one of the best harbors in the Western Mediterranean, it was re-founded by the Carthaginian general Hasdrubal in 228 BC as Qart Hadasht (\"New City\"), a name identical to Carthage, for the purpose of serving as a stepping-off point for the conquest of Spain. The Roman general Scipio Africanus conquered it in 209 BC and renamed it as Carthago Nova (literally \"New New City\") to distinguish it from the mother city. It became a tributary community (civitas stipendaria). Julius Caesar gave the town Latin Rights, and Octavian renamed it in his honor as the colony Colonia Victrix Iulia Nova Carthago or Colonia Vrbs Iulia Nova Carthago (C. V. I. N. C.) depending on the source. The city was very relevant both in the Carthaginian and the Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. In 298 AD, Diocletian constituted a new Roman province in Hispania called Carthaginensis and settled the capital in this city. It remained important until it was sacked by the Vandals in 435 AD.\nDuring the Roman period, it was the site of major silver mines, yielding a daily revenue of 25,000 drachmae. It was known also for the production of garum, a fermented fish sauce, and for esparto grass which granted it a new name, Cartago Spartaria.\n### Middle Ages\nThe demise and fall of Western Roman sovereignty caused Cartago Spartaria to go into decline. It was occupied successively by the Vandals (409–425), the Visigoths (425–551 and 624–714) and the Eastern Romans (551–624), who made it the capital of Spania (the Byzantine Empire's westernmost province). Cartagena was re-conquered by the Visigoths, who held it until the Muslim conquest in 714 AD. By that time it was barely a fishing village. It was called Qartayannat-al-Halfa. It was subsequently ruled by the Umayyads (714–756), the Caliphate of Cordova (756–1031), the Taifa of Denia (1031–1076), the Taifa of Saragossa (1076–1081), the Taifa of Tortosa (1081–1092), the Almoravids (1092–1145), the Almohads (1145–1229) and the Taifa of Murcia (1229–1245). Following the local refusal to abide to the 1243 Treaty of Alcazaz, a Castilian army led by the infante Alfonso of Castile took Cartagena by force in 1245 by means of a military operation combining land forces and a Cantabrian fleet. It was granted a fuero copied after Córdoba's in 1246. Similarly to the other subdued rebel towns, it early underwent an aggressive process of Castilianization. The Bishopric of Cartagena was created. In 1270, Alfonso created the Order of Santa María de España for the naval defense of the Crown of Castile and established its headquarters in Cartagena. In 1296, Cartagena was briefly annexed to the Crown of Aragon, but returned to Castile by the Treaty of Elx in 1305, which fixed the final boundary between the kingdoms of Valencia and Murcia. Cartagena then lost its status as royal demesne and became a seigneurial jurisdiction, a situation which lasted until 1346. Cartagena did not fully recover until the 18th century, when it became a leading naval port in the Mediterranean.\n### Modern history\nOn 3 September 1643, the Battle of Cartagena took place near the Cabo de Gata between a Spanish fleet and a French fleet.\nIn 1728, Cartagena became the capital of the Spanish Navy's Maritime Department of the Mediterranean and the city was heavily fortified with the construction of a modern castle in the place of a former Moorish Kasbah, several barracks and a huge arsenal. In a relatively short period of time, the population of the city grew from around 10,000 to 50,000 inhabitants.\nIn 1757, during the Seven Years' War, a French naval force was forced to take shelter in the port. A squadron under Duquesne sent to reinforce them was attacked and defeated by a British squadron under Henry Osborn at the Battle of Cartagena.\nIn 1873, the city established a self-governing Canton of Cartagena and become the center of the Cantonal Revolution. Governmental forces besieged the city for several months until they surrendered.\nDuring the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), Cartagena was the main base of the Spanish Republican Navy and one of the primary strongholds of the Republican Government. It held out against the forces of General Francisco Franco longer than any other city in Spain, being the last of its cities to surrender. The city saw its industrial activity increased during the 1950s, resulting in more prosperity and this trend continued until a general decline in manufacturing throughout Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n### Present\nAt the moment, Cartagena comprises part of the autonomous community of the Region of Murcia, and is the seat of the Regional Assembly of Murcia. It is also capital of the maritime province of Cartagena, which was granted by the Royal Decree of 5 October 1607 under the reign of Philip III.\n## Demographics\nAccording to the Municipal census, as of January 2011, Cartagena has 218,210 inhabitants, ranking 24th in Spain in terms of population (and 6th among the non-capitals). 182,021 people live in the urban area and 39,840 in the several satellite quarters. According to the official population data, 14.73% of the municipality's population had a foreign nationality.\nIts metropolitan area, which includes the municipalities of La Unión, Fuente Álamo de Murcia, Los Alcázares, San Javier, Torre Pacheco, San Pedro del Pinatar and Mazarrón, has a total of 390,983 inhabitants.\n## Economy\nEconomy activities related to energy are among the main ones in the municipality. They are located in Valle de Escombreras. This spot, which is a valley, is located in a district named Escombreras that is placed in the south of the municipality and of 5–10 km from the main locality by its west. Agriculture is another noteworthy activity in the Cartagena and 37.9% of the territory consisted of crop lands in 2017. The most widely grown products are melons, lettuces, potatoes, lemons and almonds. 52.77% of the agreements occurred in this sector and 42.83% of the workers were hired as labourers in 2012. the Shipbuilding has less weight than some centuries ago, but it is still moderately important. This is performed in the port of Cartagena, the main locality of the municipality. Plastic production is also performed, specifically in the northwest of the territory. The tertiary sector has risen during the last decades, specifically tourism and hotel industry. 14,12% of the agreements in the municipality were aimed at waiters in 2012.\n## Government and administration\nAs generally in Spain, the governors of the municipalities are indirectly elected on the day of municipal and regional elections, every four years. The D'Hondt system is used for allocating the governors from the votes. The body of all the elected councilors is named pleno and has 27 members in Cartagena. The head governor has the name of alcalde (feminine, alcaldesa). Since Cartagena is inhabited by more than 5,000 people, there is also a junta de gobierno local, the members are selected by the alcalde from the pleno. Currently, there are 9 members in the governing cabinet. Four members of the cabinet belong to Partido Popular party, one to Ciudadanos and there are also four nonpartisan politicians, including the alcaldesa, who belonged to PSOE (Partido Socialista Obrero Español) party but were expelled of the party because they had made an agreement with Partido Popular party and Ciudadanos in order to compose the pleno.\nThere are also committees named juntas vecinales in some localities and districts. Administrative centres are also available for inhabitants who don't live in the main town and the can perform some administrative processes there. They are located in some districts and localities and name is omitas.\n## Main sights\nThanks to its strategic position on the Mediterranean, Cartagena has been inhabited by many different cultures, which have left their mark on its rich cultural heritage during a glorious and turbulent history.\nThe \"Cartagena, Port of Cultures\" initiative was created to allow visitors to enjoy a wide range of activities and visits, discovering the cultural wealth and rich history of the city. It is one of several projects to energize the tourist possibilities of this potential major cultural destination, frequently neglected by the mass-tourism, due to the proximity of several holiday resorts, and the refinery and other industrial development, which gave a bad reputation to the city because of pollution; these last have now fortunately been eradicated.\n### Archaeological sites\nAlthough there are some ruins from the Carthaginian period, like the remains of the Punic rampart (built in 227 BC with the foundation of the city), most of its oldest monuments date from the time of the Roman Empire when Cartagena flourished. The archaeologist Blanca Roldán studied this Punic Rampart and other Punic remains, especially on the Molinete Hill. Among its numerous Roman remains, the recently restored Roman theatre of Carthago Nova is prominent and is one of the city's landmarks. Work on it started at the end of the 2nd century BC. The Roman Theatre Museum was recently officially inaugurated. In Roman Republican Times, the mines near Cartagena provided silver and lead for all the Roman Empire.\nOther Roman remains can be found in several buildings and interpretative centres, including the Roman Colonnade, the House of Fortune, the decumanus/cardo and the Augusteum. The Torre Ciega was built by the Romans for burials; it formed part of the Necropolis.\nThe Roman Amphitheatre (1st century AD) was sited where the now-abandoned Bullring was built, but only some of the surrounding walls and part of the rooms under the stands are still visible. Recent work is revealing more evidence.\nBesides the Roman heritage, archaeological sights include the remains of the Santa María la Vieja Cathedral, which was irreversibly destroyed during the Spanish Civil War. It dates from the end of the 13th century. The decorated floor of a Roman house of the 1st century BC can be found in the crypt.\nA Byzantine rampart can be found, close to the Roman Theatre and the Cathedral.\nThe Concepción Castle (now Centre for the Interpretation of the History of Cartagena) was reconstructed in the 13th century using large structures from the Amphitheatre. Apart from the Roman Theatre Museum, there are also two important archaeological museums: the Municipal Archaeological Museum and the recently opened Arqua (National Museum of Maritime Archaeology).\n### Baroque and Neo-classical buildings\nThe Campus Muralla del Mar, an old military hospital, was one of the first works carried out after the transformation of the city into the main Spanish naval base in the Mediterranean, and is now the seat of the Polytechnic University. In the vicinity, there is the Autopsy Theatre, which is where anatomy classes used to be given. Rehabilitation for tourism provides for the interpretation of the nearby buildings at the time of their construction.\nThese buildings and several other baroque or neo-classical buildings demonstrate the military importance of Cartagena. These include the Charles III Rampart, the Castillo de San Julián, the Arsenal, the Midshipmen's Barracks (academy and naval barracks), the Naval Headquarter Palace (built in 1740 and subsequently rebuilt) and the Artillery Headquarters, which also houses the Military Museum. Among the Baroque or Neo-classical Churches in Cartagena are El Carmen, Santo Domingo and Santa Maria de Gracia.\nThe austere facade of the Molina House hides the Centre of Arts and Craft.\n### Modernist and Eclectic buildings\nCartagena is home to numerous Art Nouveau buildings from the early 20th century, when a bourgeoisie settled in the city due to the growth of the local mining industry. These buildings include the City Hall, the Grand Hotel, the Casino (all of them among the city's landmarks).\nThe Railway Station has some outstanding iron doors and columns on its facade, and inside can still be seen the original ticket office, door frame, ceiling, and lamps. Other modernist or eclectic houses include the Clares House, the Aguirre Palace (which houses the Regional Museum of Modern Art, or MURAM), the Cervantes House (relatively big in comparison with other modernist buildings), the Llagostera House, the Pedreño Palace, the Dorda House, the Zapata House and the Urban Expansion Company House.\nSeveral charming, lively streets cover this area, such as Calle Mayor (High Street), the major pedestrian and commercial street of the city, full of boutiques and bars with typical \"tapas\", Carmen Street, Puertas de Murcia Street and many more.\nThe Caridad church is one of the most important churches in the city, since it is dedicated to the patron of Cartagena, Nuestra Señora de Caridad. The interior is dominated by a dome, similar to the Pantheon of Agrippa, in Rome. There are also several outstanding sculptures by the famous Murcian sculptor Francisco Salzillo and his school.\n### Modern sights\nThe Civil War Shelter-Museum is based on the galleries excavated out the Concepción hill (site of the Castle) to serve as air-raid shelters during the Spanish Civil War. Many naval and military attractions belong to this era, such as the Naval Museum and the world-famous Peral Submarine invented by Isaac Peral (born in Cartagena) that was launched in 1888 as one of the first submarines ever. It was displayed on Cartagena's harbour promenade until its move to the Naval Museum, after a full restoration.\nThe Monument to the Heroes of Santiago de Cuba and Cavite (1923) is a war memorial erected in honour of the Spanish sailors who died in combat with the US Navy in waters off Cavite and Santiago off the Philippine and Cuban coasts.\nOther attractions include the Lift-Gangway near the former Bullring and the Concepción Hill, the Regional Assembly (the Parliament of the Region of Murcia) whose facade includes architectural influences from the Renaissance while maintaining a modernist air (typical in the Levant), and the Carmen Conde-Antonio Moliner Museum that reconstructs the atmosphere in which these poets from Cartagena created some of their most important works.\n### Beaches\nAlthough the city itself is only a port, within the city limits lies part of La Manga del Mar Menor (the other part belonging to the municipality of San Javier) which encompasses the Mar Menor. Cartagena also includes part of the Murcian Mediterranean Coast. Cartagena holds the distinction of being the Spanish city with the most beaches (10) certified \"Q for Quality\" by the ICTE (Instituto para la Calidad Turística Española). These beaches are: Cala Cortina, Islas Menores, Playa Honda beach, Mar de Cristal, Cala del Pino, Cavanna beach, Barco Perdido beach, El Galúa beach, Levante beach and La Gola beach.\nEl Portús beach is adjacent to the naturist camping site, so nude bathing is practiced on this beach.\n## Healthcare\nCartagena is in Healtharea II (Cartagena) in Region of Murcia. In this area there are 17 subareas, and 13 are in the municipality. 2 hospitals are included in the region and both are placed in the municipality. Cartagena is also home to 30 consultorios (primary care health centres with fewer functions than the centros de salud) and 12 centros de salud.\n## Transport\nCartagena is served by the Autopista AP-7 linking it to towns and cities further up the Mediterranean coast, and Autovía A-30 to Murcia. The Chinchilla–Cartagena railway reached Cartagena railway station in 1863 and the current station opened in 1903. It will be the future terminus of the Madrid–Levante high-speed rail network. The narrow-gauge Cartagena-Los Nietos Line serves commuters between Cartagena and La Unión and Los Nietos to the east.\nBus facilities are also present in Cartagena by the urban bus service. There are lines to localities of the municipalities and adjacent municipalities such as La Unión and Torre-Pacheco.\n## Education\nThere are 9 early childhood and primary education public centres in the main town and 5 secondary centres. Four concertados (semiprivate or quasiprivate) centres are also placed in the territory and they include primary as well as secondary education. 38 primary education centres are located in the other districts as well as 10 secondary education centres. A special education centre can be found in the district El Plan, that is in the east of the western half of Cartagena.\nA public university named Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT), a centre of the public distance university UNED, a campus of the private university Universidad Católica de Murcia (UCAM) and a private university, which name is ISEN, occur in the municipality. UPCT includes degrees related to engineering and architecture, in UNED there are 28 degrees, in UCAM people can choose among 9 degrees and in ISEN 9 degrees are taught.\nThere are also three vocational education centres (CIFP) in the municipality, but vocational degrees are taught in some secondary education centres (IES). The main town is home to a centre of a national public organisation about language teaching. English, French, German, Arabic and Italian are taught from A1 level to C2.\nThey town council has an organisation named Universidad Popular de Cartagena where several courses are taught and courses for access to middle vocational degrees, higher vocational degrees and university degrees are included. A centre for adult education can also be found in the main town where people can study elemental contents, secondary education for adults, the contents of the secondary education examination, the contents of the entry examination for CFGS (higher level vocational education), the contents of the entry examination for university degrees, Spanish, English, and a FPB (basic vocational education) for Computing.\n## Sports\nProbably, the most remarkable element in regards to sports is Fútbol Club Cartagena (F. C. Cartagena) team, which is in Segunda División, the second level of the Spanish football league system. Another sport team is Futsal Cartagena, which is most in Segunda División during most seasons. A successful team is UCAM Cartagena Tenis de Mesa.\nOthers sport that are played in the municipality is basketball along with Club Basket Cartagena; handball, which most noteworthy team is C.A.B.

{"name": "Church of Saint Nicholas Orphanos", "documents": ["# Church of Saint Nicholas Orphanos\nThe Church of Saint Nicholas Orphanos (Greek: Ἅγιος Νικόλαος ὁ Ὀρφανός) is an early 14th-century Byzantine church in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki. Covered in outstanding Byzantine frescoes, the church is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List along with other Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki, demonstrating the importance of Thessaloniki in early Christian history.\n## Location\nThe church is located in the northeastern corner of the old city, just inside the eastern wall, between the Irodotou and Apostolou Pavlou streets.\n## History and description\nThe church's name, \"Saint Nicholas the Orphan\", is first attested in the 17th and 18th centuries, and presumably refers to its otherwise unknown ktetor (founder). From its interior decoration, the building is dated to the period 1310–1320. The church originally formed part of a monastery, traces of which (remnants of a gate) survive to the east.\nThe church was originally built as a simple, single-aisled edifice with a wooden gabled roof. Later, aisles were added on three sides. They form an ambulatory, under whose floor several graves have been found. The masonry features irregular layers of brick and stone, with a few ceramics on the eastern side and brick decoration on the eastern and western sides. In the interior, the central aisle is connected to the others with double openings decorated with reused late antique capitals. The church's original marble templon survives.\nThe church is most notable for its frescoes, contemporary with the church's construction, which cover almost the entire interior surface. The frescoes are an example of the Thessalonican school at the height of the \"Palaiologan Renaissance\", and their creator may be the same who decorated the Hilandar Monastery in Mount Athos in 1314. The church has been linked to the Serbian king Stephen Uroš II Milutin (r. 1282–1321), who is known to have sponsored churches in the city, on account of the depiction in the main aisle of St George Gorgos, the Serbian ruler's patron saint, and of St. Clemens of Ohrid, a favourite motif of the Serbian churches.\nThe monastery continued functioning throughout the Ottoman period.

{"name": "Ramat Shlomo", "documents": ["# Ramat Shlomo\nRamat Shlomo (Hebrew: רמת שלמה, lit. Shlomo's or Solomon's Heights) is a large Jewish housing development in northern East Jerusalem. The population, mostly ultra-Orthodox, is 20,000.\nRamat Shlomo was built on land occupied by Israel since its capture from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day War and is considered by the international community to be an Israeli settlement. The international community considers Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.\n## History\nAccording to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from the nearby Palestinian villages in order to construct Ramat Shlomo:\n1,494 dunams from Shuafat, 232 dunams from Beit Hanina, 53 dunams from Beit Hanina el Balad (the old town)-\nRamat Shlomo was founded in 1995. It borders Ramot to the west, Har Hotzvim to the south, and Shuafat to the east. Initially called Reches Shuafat (Shuafat Ridge), it was later named for Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach.\nTeddy Stadium was initially planned for Ramat Shlomo, but in the wake of Haredi protests the stadium and sports complex was moved to Jerusalem's Malha neighbourhood.\nLess than 200 meters separate the neighborhood's furthermost houses from the first row of homes in Shuafat and Beit Hanina.\nIn June 2008, Israel's interior ministry approved construction of an additional 1,300 apartments in Ramat Shlomo. Israel says that most of the building is on land annexed by the state and thus does not violate its commitment not to build on disputed land.\nIn March 2010, the Jerusalem municipality approved the construction of an additional 1,600 apartments in Ramat Shlomo. The announcement coincided with the visit of U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden, angering the U.S. government and prompting the Palestinian Authority to pull out of US-brokered indirect \"proximity talks\" intended to revive the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. The European Union was also critical of the decision. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu replied that Israel's policy on building in Jerusalem was the same policy followed by all Israeli governments over the past 42 years, and had not changed.\nIn October 2014, Netanyahu approved the construction of 660 additional units, followed by an additional 500 in November.

As such it is considered an Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem by the international community. Israel disputes this and considers Ramat Shlomo to be a neighborhood within the Israeli designated borders of Jerusalem.

The name means “mouth of Saint Monica” — the nearby Tongva Sacred Springs reminded Spanish diarist Juan Crespi of Saint Monica, “the weeping saint” and the adjacent area became known as Santa Mónica.\nFrancisco Marquez and his wife, Roque Valenzuela, built an adobe house in the upper mesa of the canyon. Marquez built a blacksmith shop and continued to live and work the rancho until his death in 1850.\nWith the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican–American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Boca de Santa Mónica was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852. The boundary with Rancho San Vicente y Santa Mónica was disputed, and was not finally resolved of until 1882, when the United States courts patented Rancho Boca de Santa Mónica to Marquez and Reyes at 6,656 acres (27 km2).\nYsidro Reyes and his wife, Maria Antonia Villa, built a house in what is now the Huntington Palisades. Ysidro Reyes died in 1861, leaving his undivided one-half interest in the rancho to his widow Maria Antonia. In 1872, Maria Antonia Reyes sold that interest to Col. Robert S. Baker. In 1874, Baker filed suit to partition the land among himself and the heirs of Francisco Marquez, who jointly held the other one-half interest.\nIn the mid-1920s, the families sold the land to Santa Monica Land & Water Co., owned by Robert Gillis.\nDescendant Ernest Marquez has documented the Rancho Boca de Santa Mónica since the 1950s. Pascual Marquez Family Cemetery is a designated Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.\n## Historic sites of the Rancho\nMarquez Family Cemetery.

{"name": "Scott County, Tennessee", "documents": ["# Scott County, Tennessee\nScott County is a county located in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Its county seat is Huntsville. Scott County is known for having seceded from Tennessee in protest of the state's decision to join the Confederacy during the Civil War, and subsequently forming The Free and Independent State of Scott.\n## History\nScott County was formed in 1849 from portions of Anderson, Campbell, Fentress and Morgan counties. It is named for U.S. Army General Winfield Scott, a hero of the Mexican War.\n### State of Scott\nDuring the Civil War, the county was a Southern Unionist bastion, voting against secession from the Union in Tennessee's June 1861 referendum by a higher percentage (521 to 19, or 96%) than in any other Tennessee county. This sentiment was encouraged by a June 4, 1861, speech in Huntsville by U.S. Senator Andrew Johnson. In 1861, the county assembly officially enacted a resolution seceding from the state of Tennessee, and thus the Confederacy, forming the \"Free and Independent State of Scott,\" also known simply as the \"State of Scott.\" The county remained a pro-Union enclave throughout the war. Ulysses S. Grant received over 90% of the vote in Scott County during both the 1868 United States presidential election and the 1872 United States presidential election.\nThe proclamation was finally repealed, over a hundred years later, by Scott County in 1986.\n## Geography\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 533 square miles (1,380 km2), of which 532 square miles (1,380 km2) is land and 0.9 square miles (2.3 km2) (0.2%) is water. The county is located in a relatively hilly area atop the Cumberland Plateau. In the southwestern part of the county, the Clear Fork and New River converge to form the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River, a major tributary of the Cumberland River, and the focus of a national river and recreation area.\nU.S. Route 27 is the county's primary north–south road. State Route 63 connects Scott County with Campbell County to the east. State Route 52 connects Scott County with the Fentress County area to the west. A portion of State Route 297 connects Oneida with the Big South Fork Recreation Area. State Route 456 is another major road in the area.\n### Adjacent counties\nMcCreary County, Kentucky (north) Campbell County (east) Anderson County (southeast) Morgan County (southwest) Fentress County (west/CST Border) Pickett County (northwest/CST Border) Wayne County, Kentucky (northwest)\n### National protected area\nBig South Fork National River and Recreation Area (part)\n### State protected areas\nNorth Cumberland Wildlife Management Area (part) Scott State Forest (part) Twin Arches State Natural Area (part)\n## Demographics\n1790-1960 1900-19901990-2000 2010-2014 }}\n### 2020 census\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 21,850 people, 8,664 households, and 6,059 families residing in the county.\n### 2000 census\nAt the 2000 census, there were 21,127 people, 8,203 households and 6,012 families residing in the county.

{"name": "Orsel and Minnie McGhee House", "documents": ["# Orsel and Minnie McGhee House\nThe Orsel and Minnie McGhee House is a single family home located at 4626 Seebaldt Street in Detroit. The house played a role in the landmark Shelley v. Kraemer Supreme Court decision that determined racially restrictive covenants to be unenforceable. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2022.\n## History\nThe neighborhood surrounding the Orsel and Minnie McGhee House was first built up in the early 1910s, with most of the houses built between 1912 and 1920, The McGhee House itself was constructed in 1912. The property went through multiple hands before being occupied by John C. and Meda Furgeson. In 1934, the Furgesons signed a racially restrictive covenant with other White residents of the neighborhood, which only allowed other Whites to purchase property in the neighborhood. They later sold the house to Walter Joachim. In 1944, Joachim was moving to California, and wanted to sell quickly. Orsel and Minnie McGhee, a Black couple, offered to purchase the house, and the transaction was completed in November 1944.\nOrsel McGhee was born in 1901 in Eutaw, Alabama. Orsel moved to Detroit in the 1920s and married Doree Diffay in 1925. The couple had two children, but Doree died in 1937. Orsel worked at the National Bank of Detroit before becoming a custodian at the Detroit Free Press. He eventually became superintendent of the maintenance crew and worked there until his retirement in 1963. Minnie Leatherman Simms was born in 1903 and attended the Tuskegee Normal School. She moved to Detroit in 1938 and worked as a postal clerk. She met and married Orsel McGhee later that year. After they married, the McGhees began to save for a house. They first rented in an area just south of Tireman Avenue only a few blocks from this property. In 1944 they had saved enough to begin looking for a home, and found the listing for this house for sale by Walter Joachim. They purchased the house in November 1944 and moved in by the end of the year.\nHowever, only a few weeks later, in early 1945, a group of White neighbors confronted the McGhees, including their next-door neighbors Benjamin and Anna Sipes. The neighbors demanded the McGhees leave, referencing the racial covenant. The McGhees refused, and the neighbors filed suit. The case, Sipes v. McGhee, was brought before the Wayne County Circuit Court in May 1945. The NAACP helped defend the McGhees, but Circuit Court Judge Guy A. Miller rules against them. The case was appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court, and started attracting national attention, including amicus curiae briefs were filed in support by the NAACP, the United Auto Workers, the American Jewish Congress, and several other legal advocacy groups. Nonetheless, in January 1947, the Michigan Supreme Court unanimously found against the McGhees.\nAt the same time, similar cases in other states were winding their way through the justice system. The NAACP consolidated the McGhees' case with Shelley v. Kraemer and appealed the two to the Supreme Court of the United States. The case was argued in January 1948, and later that year the Court unanimously ruled in favor of the McGhees and other Black homeowners, holding that the enforcement of a racially based restrictive covenant in a state court would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nAfter the Supreme Court ruling, some White neighbors still resisted integration, but the Sipes - the next-door neighbors who had lent their name to the original suit - regretted their participation. In fact, the Sipes and McGhees grew to become good friends, and as more Black families moved into the neighborhood, the Sipes were the last White family to remain on the block, moving only in 1974 after Benjamin's death. In 1968 the McGhees, wishing to downsize, move into a smaller house down the block and sold the house at 4626 Seebaldt to Eddie and Gladys Mitchell. In 1980 the property was purchased by John D. Lewis, and in 2011 by Velma and Tony Rucker.\n## Description\nThe Orsel and Minnie McGhee House is a two-story, rectangular, foursquare house with a hopped roof. The house is two bays wide with a full length, half-hipped roof front porch and an off-center front doorway. A bay window projects under the porch roof, creating an asymmetry on the first floor. On the second floor, a pair of windows are centered on the facade in a symmetrical pattern. The roof is shingled, with a centered hipped-roof dormer. Decorative rafter ends under the eaves demonstrate a Craftsman influence. The exterior has been altered, most notably by the addition of red brick-patterned asphalt siding applied over the original wood clapboard siding."], "selected_questions": ["When was the Orsel and Minnie McGhee House listed on the National Register of Historic Places?", "What year was the Orsel and Minnie McGhee House constructed?", "What constitutional clause did the Supreme Court rule the enforcement of racially restrictive covenants violated?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The Orsel and Minnie McGhee House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2022.", "The Orsel and Minnie McGhee House was constructed in 1912.", "The Supreme Court ruled that the enforcement of racially restrictive covenants violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution."], "InternLM_answers": ["The Orsel and Minnie McGhee House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 14, 2011.", "The Orsel and Minnie McGhee House was constructed in 1948.", "The Supreme Court ruled that the enforcement of racially restrictive covenants violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution."], "human_GPT3.5_answers_D_ann": [["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2022"], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> The McGhee House itself was constructed in 1912"], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> ...later that year the Court unanimously ruled in favor of the McGhees and other Black homeowners, holding that the enforcement of a racially based restrictive covenant in a state court would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"]], "human_InternLM_answers_ann": [["<Hallucination> Contradictory\n<Reference> It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2022\n<Correction>  \"on September 14, 2011\" to \"in 2022\"."], ["<Hallucination> Contradictory\n<Reference> The McGhee House itself was constructed in 1912\n<Correction>  \"The Orsel and Minnie McGhee House was constructed in 1948.\" to \"The Orsel and Minnie McGhee House was constructed in 1912.\""], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> ...later that year the Court unanimously ruled in favor of the McGhees and other Black homeowners, holding that the enforcement of a racially based restrictive covenant in a state court would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"]], "language": "en"}

It lies in the Székely Land, an ethno-cultural region in eastern Transylvania. The Siculicidium took place here.\nThe commune is composed of a single village, Siculeni. In 2004, four villages broke off to form Ciceu and Racu Communes.\n## Demographics\nAccording to the 2011 census, the commune has a population of 2,711. Of these, 94.46% were Hungarians and 5.49% Romanians.\n## History\nThe village was part of the Székely Land region of the historical Transylvania province.\nIts Hungarian name was first recorded in 1567 in the form of Amadeffalwa (Amadé's village), and in 1602 the village is already mentioned by a shortened forms as Madéfalva which became the names of the village. Later, until 1899 the official name of the city was Csík-Mádéfalva. The Romanian form of its name was Madefalău, The authorities renamed it for the current official name after 1919.\nThe Siculicidium, or the Massacre at Madéfalva of January 7, 1764 took place here. 200 Székely were killed by Maria Theresa's Habsburg army as the local Székely Hungarians refused to join as recruits the newly organized borderguard regiments. Following the massacre, a great number of Székely people began to flee the region crossing the Carpathian Mountains into Bukovina and Moldova. The massacre's Latin name is Siculicidium, traditionally written as SICVLICIDIVM. A monument in memory of the massacre was erected on October 8, 1905.\nThe village administratively belonged to Csíkszék district until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when it fell within the Csík County in the Kingdom of Hungary. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, the village became part of Romania and fell within Ciuc County during the interwar period. In 1940, the second Vienna Award granted the Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the villages were held by Hungary until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and the village became officially part of Romania in 1947. Always inside Romania, between 1952 and 1960, the commune fell within the so-called Magyar Autonomous Region, between 1960 and 1968 the Mureș-Magyar Autonomous Region. In 1968, Romania administration was organized in 42 counties, and since then, the commune has been part of Harghita County.\nThe commune used to comprise several villages, but as from 2004 the village of Ciceu (Csicsó) forms an independent commune with the village of Ciaracio (Csaracsó).

{"name": "Eystein Church", "documents": ["# Eystein Church\nEystein Church (Norwegian: Eysteinkyrkja) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Dovre Municipality in Innlandet county, Norway. It is located in the village of Hjerkinn. It is one of the two churches for the Dombås parish which is part of the Nord-Gudbrandsdal prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Hamar. The white, modern, cast concrete church was built in a long church design in 1969 using plans drawn up by the architects Magnus Poulsson and Anton Poulsson. The church seats about 110 people.\n## History\nKing Eystein Magnusson is said to have built mountain lodges along the road through the Dovrefjell mountains. Legend has it that there was also a church built in the area of today's village of Hjerkinn. Archaeological records support the idea that the church was likely built during the 11th or 12th century and it likely fell out of use sometime around the year 1500. All of this was the inspiration for the 20th-century Eysteinkyrkja. During the 1930s, discussions began for building a chapel along the old road through the Dovrefjell mountains near the Hjerkinn mountain lodge. The local priest in Dovre and the Bishop Kristian Schjelderup supported the idea.

{"name": "Sinharaja Forest Reserve", "documents": ["# Sinharaja Forest Reserve\nSinharaja Forest Reserve is a forest reserve and a biodiversity hotspot in Sri Lanka. It is of international significance and has been designated a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nAccording to International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Sinharaja is the country's last viable area of primary tropical rainforest. More than 60% of the trees are endemic and many of them are considered rare. 50% of Sri Lankan's endemics species of animals (especially butterfly, amphibians, birds, snakes and fish species). It is home to 95% endemic birds.\nThe hilly virgin rainforest, part of the Sri Lanka lowland rain forests ecoregion, was saved from the worst of commercial logging by its inaccessibility, and was designated a World Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage Site in 1988.\nBecause of the dense vegetation, wildlife is not as easily seen as at dry-zone national parks such as Yala. There are about 3 elephants, and 15 or so leopards. The most common larger mammal is the endemic purple-faced langur.\nBirds tend to move in mixed feeding flocks, invariably led by the fearless Sri Lanka crested drongo and the noisy orange-billed babbler. Of Sri Lanka's 26 endemic birds, the 20 rainforest species all occur here, including the elusive red-faced malkoha, green-billed coucal and Sri Lanka blue magpie.\nReptiles include the endemic green pit viper and hump-nosed vipers, and there are a large variety of amphibians, especially tree frogs. Invertebrates include the endemic Sri Lankan birdwing butterfly and leeches.\n## Etymology\nSurrounded in dense fog, the dangerous, dark and mysterious Sinharaja forest is steeped in deep legend and mystery. The word Sinharaja means lion- (සිංහ/சிங்கம் sinha) king or kingdom (රාජ/ராஜா raja), and a popular folk legend has it that a legendary lion lived in this protected forest.\n## Geography\n### Location\nSinharaja Forest Reserve covers most of the Kalu Ganga basin and a small part of northern Gin Ganga. Most of the forest (60%) is contained within the borders of Rathnapura District. The other parts include Galle District with 20% and Kaluthara District with 20%.\n### Natural\nThe rainforest likely formed during the Jurassic era (from 200 million years to 145 million years ago). This forest encompasses an area of 36,000 hectares (88,960 acres/360 km²). The reserve is only 21 km (13 mi) from east to west, and a maximum of 7 km (4.3 mi) from north to south, but it is a treasure trove of endemic species, including trees, insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Sinharaja forest vegetation density has been estimated at around 240,000 plants per hectare, the most dense rain forest in Asia.\n## Human activity\nThe reserve is well-integrated with the local population who live in some dozens of villages dotted along the border. The villages are more in number along the southern border whilst the presence of some large estates along the northern border has resulted in only a few villages there. The locals collect herbal medicine, edible fruits, nuts, mushrooms, other non-timber forest products including bees honey and a sugary sap collected from a local palm species of the genus Caryota. The sap is converted into jaggery, a local brew and vinegar. Local people walk in the forest to collect the above items when they are not busy with their other agricultural pursuits. In addition, the crystal-clear water coming from dozens of streams is the main water source for all people living around the reserve. For generations, local people trekked through the forest from south to north to make their annual pilgrimage to the Adams Peak.\nIn 2013, UNESCO requested to halt the widening of the ancient road linking Lankagama area to Deniyaya along a 1-km jungle patch inside the protected area after a complaint from The Centre for Environmental and Nature Studies of Sri Lanka. The construction recommenced on August 10, 2020 after prolonged appeals by the people living in villages to the Sri Lankan Government. A group of environmentalists carried out a big social media campaign and asked the Sri Lanka Forest Department, the President, the Ministry of Environment and the Central Environment authority to stop this but the Government of Sri Lanka has decided to go ahead with it to improve the livelihood of poor villagers of the area as it will clear only 0.006% of the total landmass of the forest.\nMr. Martin Wijesinhe was one of the most significant people in Sri Lanka in connection to the Sinharaja. He was the unofficial guardian of the Sinharaja. He has been the protector and caretaker of it since the 1950s till his death in 2021.\n## Endemic Mammals\nSri Lankan elephant (Elephas maximus maximus) Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) Sri Lankan deer (Rusa unicolor unicolor) Sri Lankan spotted chevrotain (Moschiola meminna) Sri Lankan jackal (Canis aureus naria) Toque macaque (Macaca sinica) Red slender loris (Loris tardigradus) Purple-faced langur (Semnopithecus vetulus) Sinharaja shrew (Crocidura hikmiya) Golden palm civet (Paradoxurus zeylonensis) Paradoxurus aureus Golden dry-zone palm civet (Paradoxurus stenocephalus) Sri Lankan brown palm civet (Paradoxurus montanus) Yellow-striped chevrotain (Moschiola kathygre)\n## Gallery\nA waterfall in Sinharaja Rainforest Common Birdwing Yellow-browed bulbul Purple-faced langur with baby A stream in the reserve The high tree canopy in the reserve Fowlea asperrimus"], "selected_questions": ["How has Sinharaja Forest Reserve been designated by UNESCO?", "What percentage of Sri Lankan's endemic animal species can be found in Sinharaja Forest Reserve?", "Who was the unofficial guardian and caretaker of Sinharaja Forest Reserve from the 1950s until his death in 2021?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Sinharaja Forest Reserve has been designated as a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site by UNESCO.", "According to the reference provided, Sinharaja Forest Reserve is home to 50% of Sri Lankan's endemic species of animals.", "The unofficial guardian and caretaker of Sinharaja Forest Reserve from the 1950s until his death in 2021 was Mr. Martin Wijesinhe."], "InternLM_answers": ["Sinharaja Forest Reserve has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, and a UNESCO World Heritage Forest.", "Sinharaja Forest Reserve is home to 50% of Sri Lanka's endemic animal species.", "Punchi Banda Wijesundara"], "human_GPT3.5_answers_D_ann": [["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> Sinharaja Forest Reserve is a forest reserve and a biodiversity hotspot in Sri Lanka.It is of international significance and has been designated a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site by UNESCO"], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> 50% of Sri Lankan's endemics species of animals (especially butterfly, amphibians, birds, snakes and fish species)"], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> Mr.Martin Wijesinhe was one of the most significant people in Sri Lanka in connection to the Sinharaja.He was the unofficial guardian of the Sinharaja.He has been the protector and caretaker of it since the 1950s till his death in 2021", "<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> Mr.Martin Wijesinhe was one of the most significant people in Sri Lanka in connection to the Sinharaja.He was the unofficial guardian of the Sinharaja.He has been the protector and caretaker of it since the 1950s till his death in 2021"]], "human_InternLM_answers_ann": [["<Hallucination> Contradictory\n<Reference> It is of international significance and has been designated a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site by UNESCO\n<Correction>  \"and a UNESCO World Heritage Forest\" to \"because of it's international significance.\"."], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> 50% of Sri Lankan's endemics species of animals (especially butterfly, amphibians, birds, snakes and fish species)"], ["<Hallucination> Contradictory\n<Reference> Mr.Martin Wijesinhe was one of the most significant people in Sri Lanka in connection to the Sinharaja.He was the unofficial guardian of the Sinharaja.He has been the protector and caretaker of it since the 1950s till his death in 2021\n<Correction>  \"Punchi Banda Wijesundara\" to \"Martin Wijesinhe\""]], "language": "en"}

{"name": "El Djem", "documents": ["# El Djem\nEl Djem or El Jem (Tunisian Arabic: الجمّ, il-Jamm) is a town in Mahdia Governorate, Tunisia. Its population was 21,576 during the 2014 census. It is home to Roman remains including the \"Amphitheater of El Jem\".\n## History\nThe Roman city of Thysdrus was built, like almost all Roman settlements in ancient Tunisia, on former Punic settlements. In a less arid climate than today's, Thysdrus prospered as an important center of olive oil production and export. It was the seat of a Christian bishopric, which is included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees.\nBy the early 3rd century, when the amphitheater was built, Thysdrus rivaled Hadrumetum (modern Sousse) as the second city of Roman North Africa after Carthage. However, following the abortive revolt that began there in AD 238 and Gordian's suicide in his villa near Carthage, Roman troops loyal to the emperor Maximinus Thrax sacked the city. The town is shown on the 4th-century Peutinger Map.\n## Sights\n### Amphitheater\nThe Amphitheatre of El Jem could seat 35,000 spectators. Only the Colosseum in Rome (seating about 50,000 spectators) and the ruined theater of Capua were larger.\nThe amphitheater at El Djem was built by the Romans under proconsul Gordian, who was acclaimed emperor at Thysdrus around 238 and was mainly used for gladiator shows and small-scale chariot races.\nUntil the 17th century, it remained more or less whole. From then on its stones were used for building the nearby village of El Djem and transported to the Great Mosque in Kairouan. At a tense moment during struggles with the Ottomans, the Turks used cannons to flush rebels out of the amphitheater.\nThe ruins of the amphitheater were declared a World Heritage Site in 1979. It hosts the annual El Djem International Symphony Festival.\n### Others\nDrifting sand is preserving the market city of Thysdrus and the refined suburban villas that once surrounded it. Some floor mosaics have been found and published, one of them featuring the iconography of (Dea) Africa, but field archaeology has scarcely been attempted. Recently with aerial photos, a huge racetrack stadium has been discovered.\nThe dry climate of Thysdrus has helped to preserve writings on papyrus.\n## World War II\nDuring World War II a major military airfield was located near El Djem, used first by the German Luftwaffe. It was attacked on numerous occasions and later used by the United States Army Air Forces Twelfth Air Force as a transport field.

{"name": "Temple of Divus Augustus", "documents": ["# Temple of Divus Augustus\nThe Temple of Divus Augustus was a major temple originally built to commemorate the deified first Roman emperor, Augustus. It was built between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, behind the Basilica Julia, on the site of the house that Augustus had inhabited before he entered public life in the mid-1st century BC. It is known from Roman coinage that the temple was originally built to an Ionic hexastyle design. However, its size, physical proportions and exact site are unknown. Provincial temples of Augustus, such as the much smaller Temple of Augustus in Pula, now in Croatia, had already been constructed during his lifetime. Probably because of popular resistance to the notion, he was not officially deified in Rome until after his death, when a temple at Nola in Campania, where he died, seems to have been begun. Subsequently, temples were dedicated to him all over the Roman Empire.\n## History\nThe temple's construction took place during the 1st century AD, having been vowed by the Roman Senate shortly after the death of the emperor in AD 14. Ancient sources disagree on whether it was constructed by Augustus' successor Tiberius and Augustus' widow Livia or by Tiberius alone. It was not until after the death of Tiberius in 37 that the temple was finally completed and dedicated by his successor Caligula. Some scholars have suggested that the delays in completing the temple indicated that Tiberius had little regard for the honours of his predecessor. Others have argued the opposite case, pointing to evidence that Tiberius made his last journey from his villa on Capri with the intention of entering Rome and dedicating the temple. However, the emperor died at Misenum on the Bay of Naples before he could set off for the capital. Ittai Gradel suggests that the long building phase of the temple was a sign of the painstaking effort that went into its construction.\nThe long-awaited dedication took place in the last two days of August 37. According to the historian Cassius Dio, the commemorative events ordered by Caligula were exceptionally extravagant. A two-day horse race took place along with the slaughter of 400 bears and \"an equal number of wild beasts from Libya\", and Caligula postponed all lawsuits and suspended all mourning \"in order that no one should have an excuse for failing to attend\". The splendour and timing of the commemorations was a carefully calculated political act; not only was August the month in which the late emperor had died (and which was named after him), but the climax of the celebrations occurred on Caligula's birthday and the last day of his consulship. The combination of these events would have served to emphasise that Caligula was Augustus' direct descendant. Claudius later ordered that a statue of Augustus' wife Livia be raised in the temple and that sacrifices in her honour were to be made by the Vestal Virgins.\nDuring the reign of Domitian the Temple of Divus Augustus was destroyed by fire but was rebuilt and rededicated in 89/90 with a shrine to his favourite deity, Minerva. The temple was redesigned as a memorial to four deified emperors, including Vespasian and Titus. It was restored again in the late 150s by Antoninus Pius, who was perhaps motivated by a desire to be publicly associated with the first emperor. The exact date of the restoration is not known, but the restored temple is shown on coins of 158 onwards, which depict it with an octastyle design with Corinthian capitals and two statues – presumably of Augustus and Livia – in the cella. The pediment displayed a relief featuring Augustus and was topped by a quadriga. Two figures stood on the eaves of the roof, that on the left representing Romulus and the one on the right depicting Aeneas leading his family out of Troy, alluding to Rome's origin-myth. The steps of the temple were flanked by two statues of Victory.\nThe Temple of Divus Augustus was described in Latin literature as templum Augusti or divi Augusti, though Martial and Suetonius call it templum novum (\"the new temple\"), a name attested in the Acta Arvalia from AD 36. There are references to a library erected by Tiberius in the vicinity of the temple, called the bibliotecha templi novi or templi Augusti. Caligula was said to have later built a bridge connecting the Palatine and Capitoline hills, passing over the temple. Other than the well-attested cult statues of Augustus and Livia, little is known about the temple's decoration other than a reference by Pliny to a painting of Hyacinthus by Nicias of Athens, which was given to the temple by Tiberius.\nThe last known reference to the temple was on 27 May 218; at some point thereafter it was completely destroyed and its stones were presumably quarried for later buildings.

{"name": "Abbey of Fontenay", "documents": ["# Abbey of Fontenay\nThe Abbey of Fontenay is a former Cistercian abbey located in the commune of Marmagne, near Montbard, in the département of Côte-d'Or in France. It was founded by Saint Bernard of Clairvaux in 1118, and built in the Romanesque style. It is one of the oldest and most complete Cistercian abbeys in Europe, and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981. Of the original complex comprising church, dormitory, cloister, chapter house, caldarium, refectory, dovecote and forge, all remain intact except the refectory and are well maintained. The Abbey of Fontenay, along with other Cistercian abbeys, forms a connecting link between Romanesque and Gothic architecture.\n## History\n### Foundation of the order\nIn the late 11th century during the heyday of the great church of Cluny III (a magnificent Benedictine monastery in Cluny, France), although Cluny had numerous followers, Saint Robert of Molesme, the subsequent founder of Cîteaux Abbey, led a strong reaction against it. Saint Robert thought that Cluny was against the actual Rule of Saint Benedict: “to work is to pray”. As a result, Saint Robert, along with a group of monks who shared this belief, detached from Cluny.\nSaint Robert established the Order of Cistercians in Citeaux, France. The new order strictly observed the Rule of Saint Benedict. As part of this rule, monks had to be poor and live a simple life. In order not to be distracted from the religious life, Cistercians built self-sufficient monasteries in isolated areas and refused to use servants. Cistercian monasteries were independent. They differed from Cluny in that all houses were under the direct control of the abbot, and each Cistercian monastery needed to take care of its own. Each of them was most likely an independent individual society.\nBernard of Clairvaux, an abbot and the primary builder of the reformed Cistercian order, shared the same faith with Saint Robert of Molesme. However, Bernard felt that Cîteaux Abbey was not austere enough and did not completely reflect the Rule of Saint Benedict. Thus, in 1118 he founded the Abbey of Fontenay in a Burgundy valley with strictly implemented austerity.\n### History of the abbey\nThe Cistercian monks moved to Fontenay Abbey in 1130. Nine years later, the Bishop of Norwich fled to Fontenay to escape persecution, and helped finance the construction of the church with his wealth. The church was consecrated in 1147 by Pope Eugene III.\nBy 1200 the monastic complex was complete and able to serve as many as 300 monks. In 1259, the devout King Louis exempted the Abbey of Fontenay from all taxes, and being in the King’s good graces, ten years later the abbey became a royal abbey.\nIn 1359, the Abbey of Fontenay was pillaged by the armies of King Edward III of England during the Hundred Years' War. It suffered further damage during the Wars of Religion in late 16th century. In 1745, the refectory was destroyed. With the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789 all of the monks successively left the abbey due to dechristianisation during the revolution and in 1791, the site was turned into a paper mill, run by the Montgolfier brothers.\nIn 1906 Edouard Aynard, an art-loving banker from Lyon, bought the abbey and commenced its restoration which was complete by 1911. Edouard's descendants continued to work on the abbey and it remains in the Aynard family to this day. In 1981 the abbey became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n## Architecture\n### Background\nAll Cistercian churches have the same model and are similar to one another; for example, Graiguenamanagh Abbey's church, built in Ireland in 1204, has a floor plan closely resembling that of Fontenay. The spirit of Cistercian architecture is simple, conservative, and utilitarian. Cistercian monastery churches feature Romanesque architecture, including symmetrical plan, massive walls, sturdy piers, groin vaults, round arches, and a tall central nave. In medieval Europe, the Cistercian ethic of manual labor work became \"the main force of technological diffusion\" in many fields, including metallurgy.\n### Buildings\nThe Abbey was primarily constructed using stones from local areas. The church of the abbey is of typical Cistercian architecture, built in the Romanesque style. It is in a Latin cross shape, with a nave 66 metres long and 8 metres wide, two side-aisles, and a transept measuring 19 metres. In contrast to earlier churches, the church of the abbey has a flattened apse and two rectangular (instead of semicircular) chapels of each side of the transept. The cloister measures 36 by 38 metres. The chapter house is vaulted, with heavy ribs. There is a large dormitory which was re-roofed in the fifteenth century with an arched braced roof of chestnut timber.\nExcept for the demolished refectory, the abbey retains almost all of its original buildings: church, dormitory, cloister, chapter house, caldarium or \"warming room\", dovecote and forge, all built in Romanesque style. The abbot's lodgings and infirmary were built at a later date. Today the abbey buildings are set in modern manicured parterres of lawn and gravel.\nIn all of the original buildings, neither the exteriors nor interiors are decorated. Although Bernard of Clairvaux did not attempt to reject art or beauty, he was cautious of “those manifestations of beauty which lead the eyes of the mind away from the imago Dei to the imagines mundi (images of the world)”. Although there are no flowers in the capitals, no decorative motifs and no images anywhere, the abbey is still an outstanding artwork.\nThe church and the cloister, the centre of life for monks, were built in logically distributed spaces. In anticipation of the monastery’s future expansion, instead of creating an enclosed structure, the church and the cloister were created parallel or perpendicular to each other with open ends. In this way, during expansion the existing cloister and church would not be influenced.\nThere is no bell tower in the abbey, because Bernard of Clairvaux felt this would take away from the austerity. As an alternative, small bells were attached into the wall beside the church door to call lay brothers to gather together.\nIn the interior of the church, massive cruciform piers sustain high, large barrel vaults consisting of pointed arches and transverse pointed arches. Diaphragm pointed arches are also evident. The abundant use of pointed arches was chosen because “the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle,” and will support a tall building for thousands of years.\nBernard of Clairvaux, who restricted decorations, believed that only light should enter the church. For a long time it was also believed that perfect proportions can be achieved through music. Thus, when designing the glass windows, numerical ratios corresponding to music were applied. For instance, the seven windows in the west of the interior were distributed according to a musical ratio of 3/4.\nThe thirty-six meter cloister located at the back of the church is divided by pillars into small galleries. In each gallery, double column pillars with lanceolate capitals support a double arches vault. This cloister was an important place for monks to spend their spare time reading, working and praying.\n## Gallery\nThis World Heritage Site has retained the greater part of its Romanesque and Early Gothic monastic buildings, giving uniquely intact picture of a Cistercian monastery of the 12th century."], "selected_questions": ["What style of architecture was used to build the Abbey of Fontenay?", "What are the remaining intact buildings of the Abbey of Fontenay?", "What happened to the Abbey of Fontenay during the Hundred Years' War?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The Abbey of Fontenay was built in the Romanesque style.", "The remaining intact buildings of the Abbey of Fontenay are the church, dormitory, cloister, chapter house, caldarium, dovecote, and forge.

{"name": "Grudziądz Granaries", "documents": ["# Grudziądz Granaries\nGrudziądz Granaries (Polish: Spichrze w Grudziądzu) is a unique 14th-century fortification complex of river bank granaries on the Vistula river in Grudziądz, Poland.\n## History\nAfter the Teutonic Order founded the settlement of present-day Grudziądz in 1291, the Order began building fortifications encompassing the town in the fourteenth-century. Formerly, a line of fortifications already existed on a scarp to the west of the settlement. It was in the years 1346-51 that the first granary, Bornwald Granary, was built, followed by several in 1364. By 1504, around modern-day Spichrzowa Street (lit. Granary Street), fourteen granaries had already been constructed, reflecting the importance of Grudziądz in trade of craftsmanship in the region. A century later, there were 16 granaries. The construction of the granaries on top of the town walls along the Vistula river was done so to be in close proximity with the river port, and thus take advantage of the flourishing grain trade. Due to the different elevations of town and river, the granaries, which from the river side look like imposing multi-stories buildings, from the town side feature only one or two floors.\nOther than for grain trading purposes, the granaries performed other functions, i.e. one of the granaries, between 1603 and 1608 (or 1618) served as a Lutheran place of worship. During the Deluge at the hand of the Swedes, most of the granaries were burned down and only six had survived during the Swedish siege of Grudziądz. Rebuilding works lasted until the eighteenth-century, as a consequence of which, in relation to the former granary plans, those rebuilt had been less wide, covering smaller parcels of land individually. The following, nineteenth-century, further framework granaries had been built along the river scarp and riverfront (presently non-existent). Five granaries burned down in 1903, some were utilised for housing via enlarging windows and creating balconies on each elevation.\nA monumental amount of damage occurred during the final Soviet Vistula–Oder Offensive during 1945. The granaries were rebuilt between 1946 and 1966.

{"name": "History of Kyiv", "documents": ["# History of Kyiv\nThe history of Kyiv, also spelled Kiev, officially begins with its founding year as 482, but the city may date back at least 2,000 years. Archaeology dates the site of the oldest known settlement in the area to 25,000 years BC. Kyiv was the historical capital of medieval Kievan Rus' from 879 to 1240, and is now the largest city and the capital of Ukraine.\nLegend states that three brothers, Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv, and their sister Lybid, founded the city. Kyiv thus takes its name from Kyi, the eldest brother. The exact century of the city's foundation has not been determined. Legend has it that Saint Andrew (d. AD 60/70) prophesied the emergence of a great city on the future location of Kyiv. He was allegedly fascinated by the spectacular location on the hilly shores of the Dnieper River. The city is thought to have existed as early as the 6th century, initially as a Slavic settlement. Gradually acquiring eminence as the center of the East Slavic civilization, Kyiv reached its Golden Age as the center of Kievan Rus' in the 10th–12th centuries.\nIts political, but not cultural, importance drastically declined when, in 1169, it was pillaged by the troops of Andrey Bogolyubsky; the old town was destroyed, and the capital moved to Vladimir. This was followed by numerous sackings of Kyiv by Rus' princes until the town was completely destroyed during the Mongol invasion in 1240.\nIn the following centuries, the city functioned as a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbors: the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, its successor the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Tsardom of Russia which later became the Russian Empire. Kyiv was also a major political and cultural center for Ukrainian nation, especially during the Ukrainian Cossack Hetmanate in 17–18 centuries. A Christian city since 988, it still played an important role in preserving the traditions of Orthodox Christianity, especially at times of domination by Catholic Poland, and later the atheist Soviet Union.\nKyiv prospered again during the Russian industrial revolution in the late 19th century. In the turbulent period following the Russian Revolution of 1917, the city, caught in the middle of several conflicts, served as the capital of several short-lived Ukrainian states. From 1921 the city was part of the Soviet Union, from 1934 as the capital of Soviet Ukraine. In World War II, the city was destroyed again, almost completely, but quickly recovered in the post-war years, becoming the third most important city of the Soviet Union, the capital of the second-most populous Soviet republic. It now remains the capital of Ukraine, independent since 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n## Kievan Rus' to the Mongol invasion\nAccording to a legend, East Slavs founded Kiev in the 5th century. The legend of Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv speaks of a founder-family consisting of a Slavic tribal leader Kyi, the eldest, his brothers Schek and Khoriv, and also their sister Lybid, who founded the city. Kyiv (Ukrainian: Київ) is translated as \"belonging to Kyi\" or as \"Kyi's place\".\nThe non-legendary time of the founding of the city is harder to ascertain. Slavic settlement existed in the area from the end of the 5th century, that later developed into the city. Archaeological excavations demonstrate the probability of commercial activity in Kyiv's Podil district in the seventh or eighth century. However, dendrochronological analysis of the remnants of Podil's log dwellings provides evidence of settlement only as far back as 887, and, according to Omeljan Pritsak, archaeologists have proven \"beyond any doubt that Kiev as a town did not exist before the last quarter of the ninth to the first half of the tenth century.\"\nSome western historians (e.g. Kevin Alan Brook) speculate that the city was founded by Khazars or Magyars. Brook posits that Kyiv is a Turkic place name (Küi = riverbank + ev = settlement). However, the Primary Chronicle (a main source of information about the early history of the area) mentions Slavic Kievans telling Askold and Dir that they lived without a local ruler and paid tribute to the Khazars - an event attributed to the 9th century. Brook believes that during the 8th and 9th centuries the city functioned as an outpost of the Khazar empire. A hill-fortress, called Sambat (Old Turkic for \"high place\") was built to defend the area.\nWhatever the precise circumstances and date of its foundation, the city constituted a nodal point on important ancient trade routes, standing as it does near the confluence of the Dnipro and Desna river systems. The Dnipro came to serve as the standard route between Scandinavia and the Byzantine Empire, while the Desna gave the area water-borne access (via portages) to the Don and Oka-Volga basins.\nAccording to the Hustyn Chronicle, Askold and Dir (Haskuldr and Dyri) ruled the Rus' Khaganate at least in 842. They were Varangian princes, probably of Swedish origin, but not Rurikids. According to the Annals of St. Bertin (Annales Bertiniani) for the year 839, Louis the Pious, the Holy Roman Emperor, came to the conclusion that the people called Rhos (qui se, id est gentem suum, Rhos vocari dicebant) belonged to the gens of the Swedes (eos gentis esse Sueonum).\nAccording to the Primary Chronicle, Oleg of Novgorod (Helgi of Holmgard) conquered the city in 882. He was a relative of Rurik, a Varangian pagan chieftain. The date given for Oleg's conquest of the town in the Primary Chronicle is uncertain, and some historians, such as Omeljan Pritsak and Constantine Zuckerman, dispute this account and maintain that Khazar rule continued until as late as the 920s (documentary evidence exists to support this assertion — see the Kyivan Letter and the Schechter Letter).\nFrom Oleg's seizure of the city until 1169, Kyiv functioned as the capital of Kievan Rus', which was ruled by the Varangian Rurikid dynasty which gradually became Slavicized. The Grand Princes had traditional primacy over the other rulers of the land and the Kyivan princehood was a valuable prize in an intra-dynastic system. In 968 the city withstood a siege by the nomadic Pechenegs. In 988, by order of Grand Prince Volodymyr I (St. Volodymyr), the city residents accepted baptism en-masse in the Dnipro river, an event which symbolized the Baptism of Kievan Rus to Orthodox Christianity. The city reached the height of its position – its political and cultural Golden Age – in the middle of the 11th century under Volodymyr's son Yaroslav the Wise (Grand Prince from 1019 to 1054). In 1051, prince Yaroslav assembled the bishops at St. Sophia Cathedral and appointed Hilarion as the first native-born metropolitan bishop of Rus'. In spite of the East–West Schism in Christianity, the Kievan church maintained good relations with Rome (note for example prince Iziaslav I's request to Pope Gregory VII to extend to Kievan Rus \"the patronage of St. Peter\", which the Pope fulfilled by sending Iziaslav a crown from Rome in 1075).\nFollowing the fragmentation of Kievan Rus' polity, the Principality of Kiev emerged. Subsequent years saw rivalries of the competing princes of the dynasty and the weakening of Kyiv's political influence, although the city temporarily prevailed after the defeat of Polotsk at the Battle on the river Nemiga (1067) that also led to the burning of Minsk. In 1146 the next Ruthenian bishop, Kliment Smoliatich of Smolensk, was appointed to serve as the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus'. In 1169 Andrei of Suzdal (Bogolyubsky) sent an army against Mstislav II Izyaslavich and Kyiv. Led by one of his sons, it consisted of the forces of eleven other princes, representing three of the main branches of the Rurikid dynasty against the fourth, the Iziaslavichi of Volynia. The allies were victorious, and sacked the city for three days. They left the old town and the prince's hall in ruins, and took many pieces of religious artwork - including the Theotokos of Vladimir icon – from nearby Vyshhorod. Bogolyubsky established a new capital at Vladimir. He lost Kiev five years later.\nIn 1203, Prince Rurik Rostislavich captured and burned Kyiv. In the 1230s different Rus' princes besieged and ravaged the city several times. Then Mongol-Tatar forces led by Batu Khan besieged and then completely destroyed the city on 6 December 1240. The Mongols had originally planned to take the city unharmed, but upon their arrival, the garrison threw down the bodies of the Mongol diplomats sent to urge them to surrender. In revenge the Mongols broke down the gates and slaughtered much of the population, then razed the city.\n## Golden Horde\nIn the period between 1241 and 1362, the Princes of Kiev were forced to accept Mongol/Tatar overlordship. In 1245, Petro Akerovych, the Metropolitan of Kyiv, participated in the First Council of Lyon, where he informed Catholic Europe of the Mongol/Tatar threat. In 1299, Maximus (of Greek origin), the Metropolitan of Kiev, eventually moved the seat of the Metropolitanate from Kyiv to Vladimir-on-Kliazma, keeping the title. Since 1320, the city was the site of a new Catholic bishopric, when Henry, a Dominican friar, was appointed the first missionary Bishop of Kiev. In the early 1320s, a Lithuanian army led by Gediminas defeated a Slavic army led by Stanislav of Kiev at the Battle on the Irpin River, and conquered the city. The Tatars, who also claimed Kyiv, retaliated in 1324–1325, so while the city was ruled by a Lithuanian prince, it had to pay a tribute to the Golden Horde.\n## Grand Duchy of Lithuania\nKiev became a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania after the Battle at Blue Waters in 1362, when Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, beat a Golden Horde army. During the period between 1362 and 1471, the city was ruled by Lithuanian princes from different families. By order of Casimir Jagiellon, the Principality of Kiev was abolished and the Kiev Voivodeship was established in 1471. Lithuanian statesman Martynas Goštautas was appointed as the first voivode of Kiev the same year; his appointment was met by hostility from locals.\nThe city was frequently attacked by Crimean Tatars and in 1482 was destroyed again by Crimean Khan Meñli I Giray. Despite its diminished political significance, the city still played an important role as seat of the local Orthodox metropolitan. Starting in 1494, however, the city's local autonomy (Magdeburg rights) gradually increased in a series of acts of Lithuanian Grand Dukes and Polish Kings, finalized by a charter granted by Sigismund I the Old in 1516.\nKyiv had a Jewish community of some significance in the early sixteenth century. The tolerant Sigismund II Augustus granted equal rights to Jews in the city, on the grounds that they paid the same taxes as Podil's burghers. Polish sponsorship of Jewish settlement in the city added fuel to the conflict that already existed between the Orthodox and Catholic churches.\n## Kingdom of Poland\nIn 1569, under the Union of Lublin that formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Kyiv with other Ukrainian territories was transferred to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, and it became a capital of the Kiev Voivodeship. Its role of Orthodox center strengthened due to expansion of Roman Catholicism under Polish rule. In 1632, Peter Mogila, the Orthodox Metropolitan of Kyiv and Galicia established the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, an educational institution aimed to preserve and develop Ukrainian culture and Orthodox faith despite Polish Catholic oppression. Although ruled by the church, the academy provided students with educational standards close to universities of Western Europe (including multilingual training) and became the foremost educational center, both religious and secular.\nIn 1648, Bohdan Khmelnytsky's Cossacks triumphantly entered the city in the course of their uprising establishing the rule of their Cossack Hetmanate in the city. The Zaporizhian Host had a special status within the newly formed political entity. The complete sovereignty of Hetmanate did not last long as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth refused to recognize it and resumed hostilities. In January 1654, Khmelnytsky decided to sign the Treaty of Pereyaslav with Tsardom of Russia to obtain a military support against the Polish Crown. However, in November 1656 the Muscovites concluded the Truce of Vilna with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which was approved by Bohdan Khmelnytsky. After his death, in the atmosphere of sharp conflicts his successor became Ivan Vyhovsky who signed the Treaty of Hadiach. It was ratified by the Crown in a limited version. According to Vyhovsky original intention, Kyiv was to become the capital of the Grand Duchy of Ruthenia on the limited federate rights within the Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth. However, this part of the Treaty was removed during the ratification. In the meantime, Vyhovsky's opponent Yuri Khmelnytsky signed the Second Treaty of Pereyaslav in October 1659 with a representative of Russian tsar.\n## Russian Empire\nOn January 31, 1667, the Truce of Andrusovo was concluded, in which the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ceded Smolensk, Severia and Chernigov, and, on paper only for a period of two years, the city of Kiev to the Tsardom of Russia. The Eternal Peace of 1686 acknowledged the status quo and put the city under the control of Russia for the centuries to come. Kiev slowly lost its autonomy, which was finally abolished in 1775 by the Empress Catherine the Great. None of the Polish-Russian treaties concerning the city have ever been ratified.\nIn 1834, St. Vladimir University was established in the city (now known as National Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv). The Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko cooperated with its geography department as a field researcher and editor. However, the Magdeburg Law existed in Kiev till that year, when it was abolished by the Decree of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia on December 23, 1834.\nEven after Kiev and the surrounding region ceased being a part of Poland, Poles continued to play an important role. In 1812 there were over 43,000 Polish noblemen in Kiev province, compared to only approximately 1,000 Russian nobles. Typically the nobles spent their winters in the city, where they held Polish balls and fairs. Until the mid-18th century Kiev was Polish in culture. although Poles made up no more than ten percent of the city's population and 25% of its voters. During the 1830s Polish was the language of Kiev's educational system, and until Polish enrollment in the university of St. Vladimir was restricted in the 1860s they made up the majority of that school's student body. The Russian government's cancellation of the city's autonomy and its placement under the rule of bureaucrats appointed from St. Petersburg was largely motivated by fear of Polish insurrection in the city. Warsaw factories and fine Warsaw shops had branches in Kiev. Józef Zawadzki, founder of Kiev's stock exchange, served as the city's mayor in the 1890s. Poles living in the city tended to be friendly towards the Ukrainian national movement in the city, and some took part in Ukrainian organizations. Indeed, many of the poorer Polish nobles became Ukrainianized in language and culture and these Ukrainians of Polish descent constituted an important element of the growing Ukrainian national movement. Kiev served as a meeting point where such activists came together with the pro-Ukrainian descendants of Cossack officers from the left bank. Many of them would leave the city for the surrounding countryside in order to try to spread Ukrainian ideas among the peasants.\nAccording to the Russian census of 1874, of 127,251 people living in Kiev, 38,553 (39%) spoke \"Little Russian\" (the Ukrainian language), 12,917 (11%) spoke Yiddish, 9,736 (10 percent) spoke Great Russian, 7,863 (6 percent) spoke Polish, and 2,583 (2 percent) spoke German. 48,437 (or 49%) of the city's residents were listed as speaking \"generally Russian speech (obshcherusskoe narechie).\" Such people were typically Ukrainians and Poles who could speak enough Russian to be counted as Russian-speaking.\nFrom the late 18th century until the late 19th century, city life was increasingly dominated by Russian military and ecclesiastical concerns. Russian Orthodox Church institutions formed a significant part of the city's infrastructure and business activity at that time. In the winter 1845–1846, the historian Mykola Kostomarov (Nikolay Kostomarov in Russian) founded a secret political society, the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius, whose members put forward the idea of a federation of free Slavic people with Ukrainians as a distinct group among them rather than a part of the Russian nation. The Brotherhood's ideology was a synthesis of programmes of three movements: Ukrainian autonomists, Polish democrats, and Russian Decembrists in Ukraine. The society was quickly suppressed by the Tsarist authorities in March–April 1847.\nFollowing the gradual loss of Ukraine's autonomy and suppression of the local Ukrainian and Polish cultures, Kiev experienced growing Russification in the 19th century by means of Russian migration, administrative actions (such as the Valuev Circular of 1863), and social modernization. At the beginning of the 20th century, the city was dominated by Russian-speaking population, while the lower classes retained Ukrainian folk culture to a significant extent. According to the census of 1897, of the city's approximately 240,000 people approximately 56% of the population spoke the Russian language, 23% spoke the Ukrainian language, 12.5% spoke Yiddish, 7% spoke Polish and 1% spoke the Belarusian language. Despite the Russian cultural dominance in the city, enthusiasts among ethnic Ukrainian nobles, military and merchants made recurrent attempts to preserve native culture in the city (by clandestine book-printing, amateur theater, folk studies etc.).\nDuring the Russian industrial revolution in the late 19th century, Kiev became an important trade and transportation center of the Russian Empire, specializing in sugar and grain export by railroad and on the Dnieper river. By 1900, the city had also become a significant industrial center, having a population of 250,000. Landmarks of that period include the railway infrastructure, the foundation of numerous educational and cultural facilities as well as notable architectural monuments (mostly merchant-oriented, i.e. Brodsky Choral Synagogue).\nAt that time, a large Jewish community emerged in the city, developing its own ethnic culture and business interests. This was stimulated by the prohibition of Jewish settlement in Russia proper (Moscow and Saint Petersburg) — as well as further eastwards. Expelled from Kiev in 1654, Jews probably were not able to settle in the city again until the early 1790s. On December 2, 1827, Nicholas I of Russia expelled seven hundred Jews from the city. In 1836, the Pale of Settlement banned Jews from Kiev as well, fencing off the city's districts from the Jewish population. Thus, at mid-century Jewish merchants who came to fairs in the city could stay for up to six months. In 1881 and 1905, notorious pogroms in the city resulted in the death of about 100 Jews.\nThe development of aviation (both military and amateur) became another notable mark of distinction of Kyiv in the early 20th century. Prominent aviation figures of that period include Pyotr Nesterov (aerobatics pioneer) and Igor Sikorsky, both of whom hailed from the city. The world's first helicopter was built and tested in Kiev by Sikorsky, and in 1892 the first electric tram line of the Russian Empire was established in the Principality of Kiev.\n## Independence and Civil War\nIn 1917, the Central Rada (Tsentralnaya Rada), a Ukrainian self-governing body headed by the historian Mykhailo Hrushevsky, was established in the city. Later that year, Ukrainian autonomy was declared. During the period of dual power this body competed for authority with the Russian Army loyal to the Russian Provisional Government and later with the Bolsheviks.\nOn 7 November 1917, it was transformed into an independent Ukrainian People's Republic with the capital in Kiev. During this short period of independence, the city experienced rapid growth of its cultural and political status. An Academy of Sciences and professional Ukrainian-language theaters and libraries were established by the new government.\nLater the city became a war zone in the lasting and bloody struggle between Ukrainian, Polish and Russian Bolshevik governments in the time of the Russian Revolution, the Ukrainian-Soviet War, the Polish-Ukrainian War and the Polish-Soviet War.\n## Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic\nAfter the \"January Uprising\" on January 29, 1918 was extinguished, Bolshevik Red Guards took the city in the Battle of Kiev, forcing the Central Rada to flee to Zhytomyr. The Bolsheviks established Kharkov as the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic. By March, the city had been occupied by the Imperial German Army under the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.\nWith the withdrawal of German troops after the end of World War I, an independent Ukraine was declared in the capital city under Symon Petliura. Red Army forces once again recaptured the city in the January 1919 battle of Kiev, taking the time to conduct a city-census of Kyiv. In August 1919, the White armies recaptured the city, before losing it to the bolsheviks again in the Battle of Kiev of December 1919.\nIt was then briefly occupied by the White armies before the Soviets once more took control in 1920. In May 1920, during the Russo-Polish War it was briefly captured by the Polish Army but they were driven out by the Red Army.\nAfter the Ukrainian SSR was formed in 1922, Kharkov was declared its capital. Kiev, being an important industrial center, continued to grow. In 1925, the first public buses ran on city streets, and ten years later the first trolleybuses were introduced. In 1927 the suburban areas of Darnytsia, Lanky, Chokolivka, and Nikolska slobidka were included into the city. In 1932, the city became the administrative center of newly created Kyiv Oblast.\n### 1930s\nIn the 1930s, the city suffered terribly from famine and from Stalinization. In 1932–33, the city population, like most of the other Ukrainian territories, suffered from the Holodomor. In Kiev, bread and other food products were distributed to workers by food cards according to daily norm, but even with cards, bread was in limited supply, and citizens were standing overnight in lines to obtain it.\nIn 1934 the capital of Ukrainian SSR was moved from Kharkov to Kiev. The goal was to fashion a new proletariat utopia based on Stalin's blueprints. The city's architecture was made over, but a much greater impact on the population was Soviet social policy, which involved large-scale purges, coercion, and rapid movement toward totalitarianism in which dissent and non-communist organizations were not tolerated.\nIn the 1930s the process of destruction of churches and monuments, which started in the 1920s, reached the most dramatic turn. Churches and structures that were hundreds of years old, such as St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral and the Fountain of Samson, were demolished. Others, such as Saint Sophia Cathedral, were confiscated. The city's population continued to increase mostly by migrants. The migration changed the ethnic demographics of the city from the previous Russian-Ukrainian parity to predominantly Ukrainian, although Russian remained the dominant language.\nIn the 1930s, the city inhabitants also suffered from the controversial Soviet political policy of that time. While encouraging lower-class Ukrainians to pursue careers and develop their culture (see Ukrainization), the Communist regime soon began harsh oppression of Ukraine's political freedom, autonomy and religion. Recurring political trials were organized in the city to purge \"Ukrainian nationalists\", \"Western spies\" and opponents of Joseph Stalin inside the Bolshevik party. During this time, numerous historic churches were destroyed or vandalized and the clergy repressed.\nIn the late 1930s, clandestine mass executions began in Kiev. Thousands of city residents (mostly intellectuals and party activists) were arrested in the night, hurriedly court-martialed, shot and buried in mass graves. The main execution sites were Babi Yar and the Bykivnia forest. Tens of thousands were sentenced to GULAG camps. In the same time, the city's economy continued to grow, following Stalin's industrialization policy.\n## World War II\nDuring the Second World War, Nazi Germany occupied the city on 19 September 1941 (see the Battle of Kiev). Overall, the battle proved disastrous for the Soviet side but it significantly delayed the German advances. The delay also allowed the evacuation of all significant industrial enterprises from Kiev to the central and eastern parts of the Soviet Union, away from the hostilities, where they played a major role in arming the Red Army fighting the Nazis (see, for example, the Arsenal Factory).\nBefore the evacuation, the Red Army planted more than ten thousand mines throughout the city, controlled by wireless detonators. On 24 September, when the German invaders had settled into the city, the mines were detonated, causing many of the major buildings to collapse, and setting the city ablaze for five days. More than a thousand Germans were killed.\nBabi Yar, a location in Kiev, became a site of one of the most infamous Nazi WWII war crimes. During two days in September 1941, at least 33,771 Jews from Kiev and its suburbs were massacred at Babi Yar by the SS Einsatzgruppen, according to their own reports. Babi Yar was a site of additional mass murders of captured Soviet citizens over the following years, including Ukrainians, Romani, POWs and anyone suspected in aiding the resistance movement, perhaps as many as 60,000 additional people.\nIn the \"Hunger Plan\" prepared ahead of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, with the aim of ensuring that Germans were given priority over food supplies at the expense of everyone else, the inhabitants of the city were defined as \"superfluous eaters\" who were to be \"gotten rid of\" by the cutting off of all food supplies to the city – the food to be diverted to feeding the Wehrmacht troops and Germany's own population. Luckily for city inhabitants, this part of the \"Hunger Plan\" was never fully implemented.\nAn underground resistance quickly established by local patriots was active until the liberation from Nazi occupation. During the war, the city was heavily bombarded, especially in the beginning of the war and the city was largely destroyed including many of its architectural landmarks (only one building remained standing on the Khreschatyk, a main street).\nWhile the whole of Ukraine was a ' Reich commissariat', under the Nazi Reichskommissar Erich Koch, the region surrounding Kiew (as it is spelled in German) was one of the six subordinate 'general districts', February 1942 – 1943 Generalbezirk Kiew, under Generalkommissar Waldemar Magunia (b. 1902 – d. 1974, also NSDAP)\nThe city was liberated by the Red Army on 6 November 1943. For its role during the War the city was later awarded the title Hero City.\n## Post-WWII Ukrainian SSR\nDespite the end of the war, on September 4–7, 1945, an anti-semitic pogrom occurred around one hundred Jews were beaten, of whom thirty-six were hospitalized and five died of wounds.\n### 1950s–1990s\nPost-wartime in Kiev was a period of rapid socio-economic growth and political pacification. The arms race of the Cold War caused the establishment of a powerful technological complex in the city (both R&D and production), specializing in aerospace, microelectronics and precision optics. Dozens of industrial companies were created employing highly skilled personnel. Sciences and technology became the main issues of the city's intellectual life. Dozens of research institutes in various fields formed the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR.\nThe city also became an important military center of the Soviet Union. More than a dozen military schools and academies were established here, also specializing in high-tech warfare (see also Soviet education). This created a labor force demand which caused migration from rural areas of both Ukraine and Russia. Large suburbs and an extensive transportation infrastructure were built to accommodate the growing population. However, many rural-type buildings and groves have survived on the city's hills, creating Kiev's image as one of the world's greenest cities.\nThe city grew tremendously in the 1950s through 1980s. Some significant urban achievements of this period include establishment of the Metro, building new river bridges (connecting the old city with Left Bank suburbs), and Boryspil Airport (the city's second, and later international airport).\nSystematic oppression of pro-Ukrainian intellectuals, dubbed as \"nationalists\", was carried under the propaganda campaign against Ukrainian nationalism threatening the Soviet way of life. In cultural sense it marked a new wave of Russification in the 1970s, when universities and research facilities were gradually and secretly discouraged from using Ukrainian. Switching to Russian, as well as choosing to send children to Russian schools was expedient for educational and career advancement.\nThus the city underwent another cycle of gradual Russification.\nEvery attempt to dispute Soviet rule was harshly oppressed, especially concerning democracy, Ukrainian SSR's self-government, and ethnic-religious problems. Campaigns against \"Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism\" and \"Western influence\" in Kiev's educational and scientific institutions were mounted repeatedly. Due to limited career prospects in Kyiv, Moscow became a preferable life destination for many Kievans (and Ukrainians as a whole), especially for artists and other creative intellectuals. Dozens of show-business celebrities in modern Russia were born in Kiev.\nIn the 1970s and later 1980s–1990s, given special permission from the Soviet government, a significant part of the city's Jews migrated to Israel and the West.\nThe Chernobyl accident of 1986 affected city life tremendously, both environmentally and socio-politically. Some areas of the city have been polluted by radioactive dust. However, inhabitants of Kiev were neither informed about the actual threat of the accident, nor recognized as its victims. Moreover, on May 1, 1986 (a few days after the accident), local CPSU leaders ordered Kievans (including hundreds of children) to take part in a mass civil parade in the city's center—\"to prevent panic\". Later, thousands of refugees from accident zone were resettled in Kiev.\n## Independent Ukraine\n### Capital of an independent nation\nAfter 57 years as the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union, the city became the capital of independent Ukraine in 1991.\nThe city was the site of mass protests over the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election by supporters of opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko beginning on 22 November 2004 at Independence Square.

{"name": "Ardea, Lazio", "documents": ["# Ardea, Lazio\nArdea is an ancient town and comune in the Metropolitan City of Rome, 35 kilometres (22 miles) south of Rome and about 4 kilometres (2 miles) from today's Mediterranean coast.\nThe economy is mostly based on agriculture, although, starting from the 1970s, industry has played an increasingly important role.\n## History\nArdea is one of the most ancient towns in western Europe, founded during the 8th century BC. According to tradition it was the capital of the Rutuli, and it is described as such in the Aeneid.\nIn 509 BC Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the king of Rome, sought unsuccessfully to take the town by storm, and then commenced a siege of the town. However, the siege was interrupted by the revolution which resulted in the overthrow of the king and the establishment of the Roman republic. One of the leaders of the revolution, Lucius Junius Brutus, came to the camp of the Roman army at Ardea and won the army's support for the revolution.\nIn 443 BC the Volscians laid siege to Ardea. The siege was soon broken by Roman troops under the leadership of Marcus Geganius Macerinus.\nAfter the Roman conquest, Ardea was most often mentioned in connection with the Via Ardeatina, one of the consular roads, to which it gave its name.\nDuring the Second Punic War, it was one of the few cities that refused military support to Rome, and, after the Roman victory, was deprived of its autonomy. In the 3rd–2nd centuries BC it decayed until, in the Imperial Age, it was scarcely populated at all. The 1st century agricultural writer Columella possessed estates there.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Ardea was abandoned. It returned to grow only after the 9th century AD. Its castle in 1118 housed Pope Gelasius II and was later contended among various feudal barons of the area. In 1419 Pope Martin V assigned it to his kinsmen, the Colonna family, who sold it in 1564 to the Cesarini.\nIn 1816 it became a frazione of Genzano. Starting from 1932, the surrounding area was drained and Ardea began to flourish again, becoming a frazione of Pomezia starting from its foundation around 1948 and an independent municipality in 1970.\n## Main sights\nRemains of the ancient city include the old defensive agger, dating to the 7th century BC and later (4th century BC) updated to larger walls. Archaeological excavations have brought to light four temples, of unknown dedication. Part of the pavement of a basilica (c. 100 BC) have also been found in the area of the ancient Forum. Other sights include:\nThe Church of Santa Marina, erected in 1191 by Cencio Savelli, the future Pope Honorius III. The interior, on a single nave, was originally entirely frescoed. Romanesque Church of San Pietro Apostolo (12th century), which was a possession of the monks of San Paolo Fuori le Mura of Rome. It incorporates a former watchtower used to counter Saracen attacks, now turned into a bell tower. It has 15th-century frescoes and a 16th-century wooden crucifix. The Giardini della Landriana, designed by Russell Page. Giacomo Manzù Museum, housing some 400 works of the artist. Tor San Lorenzo, a tower in the eponymous seaside frazione.

{"name": "Topa, Jammu and Kashmir", "documents": ["# Topa, Jammu and Kashmir\nTopa is a village in Mendhar Tehsil, Poonch district in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Battle of Topa was fought here by 5 Gorkha Rifles.\n## History\n### Battle of Topa (1965)\nFrom anti-infiltration operations conducted by the battalion from 5 August 1965 onwards in Rajouri and Mendhar Sectors of Jammu and Kashmir, it was evident that many strong infiltrating columns of the Pakistani Army had been sent into our territory as part of Pakistan's ‘Operation Gibraltar’. By the third week of August 65, Headquarter 52 Mountain Brigade (Brigadier later Lieutenant General R D Hira, MVC) had been inducted into the sector for clearance of infiltrators from Mendhar, Surankot and Krishna Ghati area. For the operations, 4/5 GR (FF), 14 Kumaon and 3/11 GR were put under command of the brigade and made responsible for anti-infiltration operations in Mendhar in the South and Krishna Gati (KG) area of 93 Infantry Brigade Sector. Reports of major infiltration in Mendhar and Balnoi had been received and some of the roads had been blocked by Paki troops. Closer to Mendhar, Paki's had occupied Topa feature, which effectively dominated fair weather road Mendhar - Balnoi, thus cutting off Balnoi and Krishna Ghati (93 Infantry Brigade). They had also established defences at a place called OP Hill, on the ridgeline across Mendhar River. The first priority of the brigade was to cut off maintenance routes of these Paki troops and clearance of road to Balnoi and KG. Alfa Company of 21 AK Battalion Pakistan Army, with additional troops and Razakars, were reported to be occupying Topa Height (Pt 4571) and had effectively interdicted road communications in the area.\nTopa feature, Pt 4571, a dominating hill, was about 1.5 kilometres away from the Mendhar – Balnoi Road. The position had three hubs; Point 4571 (Topa Top); Gujar Kotha, a feature on its southern slopes; and a Ring Contour further to the south, called Jungle Tekri overlooking the road. It was, therefore, decided to launch a deliberate attack to capture these positions and open the road. The task of capturing Topa was given to 4/5 GR (FF). The battalion concentrated on 25 August 1965 at Mendhar for the task.\nOn 26 August, after having concentrated in the area, own troops were fired upon from Jungle Tekri and Gujar Kotha. In the initial operations, launched the same day, the area of Jungle Tekri was captured by B Coy led by Major (later Colonel) Sunit Singh, and 2 POWs, apart from the recovery of weapons and ammunition. This position, apparently, was a forward element of Topa defences. It was decided to launch a deliberate attack the next day, 27 August, to capture the feature. The task of the capture of Topa Top was given to Delta Company (Captain (later Colonel) Bikram Katoch) with Bravo Company (Sunit Singh) and Charlie Company (Major later Major General Ashok Mehta, AVSM, FRGS) as a firm base and reserve company respectively. The orders to Bikram Katoch by Commanding Officer (CO) late Lieutenant Colonel (Later Colonel) M L Bhatia were; \"'Topa lai capture Gariyo Bhane Kasto Hola'\" followed by brief orders (Translated from Gorkhali: ‘How about capturing Topa?’). Colonel Bhatia did not restrict himself with brief orders for the attack but was all along with the leading Company, just behind the leading Platoon.\nOn 27th, Captain Bikram Katoch led the assault of his company. CO, Lieutenant Colonel (Later Colonel) M L Bhatia, followed the leading platoon of D Company. As soon as the troops reached closer to the Gujar Kotha, they were fired upon. They unsheathed their Khukri's and amidst the war cry of Ayo Gorkhali assaulted the position. By about by 27th-afternoon area Gujar Kotha, position below Pt 4571 (Topa Top) was captured. The defences had mostly been captured but Pt 4571 (Topa Top) was still held. D Company pressed on and by evening Topa Top was also captured. Battalion thereafter firmed in, reorganised on the objective and road communication was opened. Two more POWs, many dead bodies of Paki soldiers and a lot of arms and ammunition were found. On 28 August 1965, during further combing operations towards the north of the ridge, Senior Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO - Subedar) of the Pak Company (JC 824 Subedar Abdul Rahman of A Coy 21 AK Battalion) was captured from a Gujjar Hut, with an injury to his right arm. He revealed that the injury was by a direct hit of a 2-inch mortar bomb, fired by mortar detachment of D Company under Naik Bir Bahadur Pun. However, Naik Bir Bahadur Pun had gallantly laid down his life, when he was hit by a bullet in the head. C Company was thereafter tasked to hold the area as the battalion less C Company moved out of the area, for further operations in the sector, which continued till the ceasefire on 22 September 1965.\n## Geography\nTopa is located at 33°39′N 74°07′E﻿ / ﻿33.65°N 74.11°E﻿ / 33.65; 74.11.

{"name": "Berkhamsted", "documents": ["# Berkhamsted\nBerkhamsted (/ˈbɜːrkəmstɛd/ BUR-kəm-sted) is a historic market town in Hertfordshire, England, in the Bulbourne valley, 26 miles (42 km) north-west of London. The town is a civil parish with a town council within the borough of Dacorum which is based in the neighbouring large new town of Hemel Hempstead. Berkhamsted, along with the adjoining village of Northchurch, is encircled by countryside, much of it in the Chiltern Hills which is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).\nThe High Street is on a pre-Roman route known by its Saxon name: Akeman Street. The earliest written reference to Berkhamsted was in 970. The settlement was recorded as a Burbium (ancient borough) in the Domesday Book in 1086. The most notable event in the town's history occurred in December 1066. After William the Conqueror defeated King Harold's Anglo-Saxon army at the Battle of Hastings, the Anglo-Saxon leadership surrendered to the Norman encampment at Berkhamsted. The event was recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. From 1066 to 1495, Berkhamsted Castle was a favoured residence of royalty and notable historical figures, including Henry II, Edward, the Black Prince, Thomas Becket and Geoffrey Chaucer. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the town was a wool trading town, with a thriving local market. The oldest known extant jettied timber-framed building in Great Britain, built between 1277 and 1297, survives as a shop on the town's high street.\nAfter the castle was abandoned in 1495, the town went into decline, losing its borough status in the second half of the 17th century. Colonel Daniel Axtell, captain of the Parliamentary Guard at the trial and execution of Charles I in 1649, was among those born in Berkhamsted. Modern Berkhamsted began to expand after the canal and the railway were built in the 19th century. In the 21st century, Berkhamsted has evolved into an affluent commuter town.\nThe town's literary connections include the 17th-century hymnist and poet William Cowper, the 18th-century writer Maria Edgeworth and the 20th-century novelist Graham Greene. Arts institutions in the town include The Rex, Berkhamsted (a well regarded independent cinema) and the British Film Institute's BFI National Archive at King's Hill, which is one of the largest film and television archives in the world. Schools in the town include Berkhamsted School, a co-educational boarding independent school (founded in 1541 by John Incent, Dean of St Paul's Cathedral); Ashlyns School a state school, whose history began as the Foundling Hospital established in London by Thomas Coram in 1742; and Ashridge Executive Education, a business school offering degree level courses, which occupies the Grade I listed neo-Gothic Ashridge House.\n## History\n### Origin of the town's name\nThe earliest recorded spelling of the town's name is the 10th century Anglo-Saxon Beorhðanstædæ. The first part may have originated from either the Old English words beorg, meaning \"hill\", or berc or beorc, meaning \"birch\"; or from the older Old Celtic word Bearroc, meaning \"hilly place\". The latter part, \"hamsted\", derives from the Old English word for homestead. So the town's name could be either mean \"homestead amongst the hills\" or the \"homestead among the birches\".\nThrough history spellings of the town's name have changed. Local historian Rev John Wolstenholme Cobb identified over 50 different versions of the town's name since the writing of the Domesday Book (such as: \"Berkstead\", \"Berkampsted\", \"Berkhampstead\", \"Muche Barkhamstede\", \"Berkhamsted Magna\", \"Great Berkhamsteed\" and \"Berkhamstead\".) The present spelling was officially adopted in 1937 when the local council formally changed its name from Great Berkhampstead to Berkhamsted. The town's local nickname is \"Berko\".\n### Prehistory and Roman period\nNeolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman artefacts show that the Berkhamsted area of the Bulbourne Valley has been settled for over 5,000 years. The discovery of a large number of worked flint chips provides Neolithic evidence of on-site flint knapping in the centre of Berkhamsted. Several settlements dating from the Neolithic to the Iron Age (about 4500–100 BC) have been discovered south of Berkhamsted. Three sections of a late Bronze Age to Iron Age (1200–100 BC) bank and ditch, sixteen feet (five metres) wide by seven to thirteen feet (two to four metres) high and known as Grim's Ditch, are found on the south side of the Bulbourne Valley. Another Iron Age dyke with the same name is on Berkhamsted Common, on the north side of the valley.\nIn the late Iron Age, before the Roman occupation, the valley would have been within Catuvellauni territory. The Bulbourne Valley was rich in timber and iron ore. In the late Iron Age, a four-square-mile (ten-square-kilometre) area around Northchurch became a major iron production centre, now considered to be one of the most important late Iron Age and Roman industrial areas in England. Iron production led to the settlement of a Roman town at Cow Roast, about two miles (three kilometres) northwest of Berkhamsted. Four Roman first century AD iron smelting bloomeries at Dellfield (one mile (two kilometres) northwest of the town centre) provide evidence of industrial activity in Berkhamsted. Production ceased at the end of the Roman period. Other evidence of Roman-British occupation and activity in the Berkhamsted area, includes a pottery kiln on Bridgewater Road. The town's high street still follows the line of the Roman-engineered Akeman Street, which had been a pre-existing route from St Albans (Verulamium) to Cirencester (Corinium).\nDuring Roman occupation the countryside close to Verulamium was subdivided into a series of farming estates. The Berkhamsted area appears to have been divided into two or three farming estates, each including one or more masonry villa buildings, with tiled roofs and underfloor heating.\nThe remains of a villa were found close to the river in 1973 in the adjacent village of Northchurch. The oldest building, made of timber, was built in AD 60, rebuilt using stone in the early 2nd century, and enlarged to a ten-room building around AD 150. The house may have been empty for a period, reoccupied in the 4th century, and abandoned in the late 4th or early 5th century. A Roman-British villa, dyke, and temple were found 1.25 miles (2.0 km) NNW of the castle, near Frithesden, at the edge of the Berkhamsted Golf Course. Excavations in 1954 revealed masonry foundations and tesserae floors. Together, the villa, dyke and temple form a unique complex, suggesting occupation in the late Iron Age and Roman period. Two flint and tile walls from a Roman building were found north of Berkhamsted Castle in 1970. The construction of the castle's earthworks in the Middle Ages may have damaged this building.\n### Anglo-Saxon settlement\nThe earliest written reference to Berkhamsted is in the will of Ælfgifu (died AD 970), queen consort of King Eadwig of England (r. 955–959), who bequeathed large estates in five counties, including Berkhamsted. The location and extent of early Saxon settlement of Berkhamsted is not clear. Rare Anglo-Saxon pottery dating from the 7th century onwards has been found between Chesham Road and St John's Well Lane, with water mills near Mill Street in use from the late 9th century, show that an Anglo-Saxon settlement existed in the centre of modern-day Berkhamsted. The nearest known structural evidence of the Anglo-Saxon period are in the south and west walls of St Mary's Northchurch, one mile (two kilometres) to the north-west of modern Berkhamsted. The church may have been an important minster, attached to a high status Anglo-Saxon estate, which became part of the medieval manor of Berkhamsted after the Norman conquest.\nThe parish of Berkhamsted St Mary's (in Northchurch) once stretched five miles (8 km) from the hamlet of Dudswell, through Northchurch and Berkhamsted to the former hamlet of Bourne End. Within Berkhamsted, the Chapel of St James was a small church near St John's Well (a 'holy well' that was the town's principal source of drinking water in the Middle Ages). The parish of this church (and later that of St Peter's) was an enclave of about 4,000 acres (1,600 ha) surrounded by Berkhamsted St Mary's parish. By the 14th century the adjoining village of \"Berkhamsted St Mary\" or \"Berkhamsted Minor\" name had become \"North Church\", later \"Northchurch\", to distinguish the village from the town of Berkhamsted.\n### 1066 and the Domesday survey\nThe Anglo-Saxons surrendered the crown of England to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted in early December 1066. After William defeated and killed Harold II at the Battle of Hastings in October, he failed in an attempt to capture London from the south. William led his army around London, crossing the River Thames at Wallingford, \"laying waste\" while travelling through southeast England. At Berkhamsted, he received the surrender of Edgar the Ætheling (heir to the English throne), Archbishop Ealdred, Earl Edwin, Earl Morcar and the leaders of London. It is not known why the town was chosen as the meeting place, except that it was in a defensive location north-west of London.  William was crowned in Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day, 1066. After his coronation, William granted the \"Honour of Berkhamsted\" to his half-brother, Robert, Count of Mortain, who after William became the largest landholder in the country. Robert built a wooden fortification that later became a royal retreat for the monarchs of the Norman and Plantagenet dynasties.\nAccording to the Domesday Book, the lord of Berkhamsted before the Norman conquest was Edmer Ator (also referred to as Eadmer Atule), thegn of Edward the Confessor and King Harold. The Domesday survey records that there was enough land for 26 plough teams, but only 15 working teams. There were two flour mills (Upper and Lower Mill), woodland for 1,000 pigs, and a vineyard. The total population was calculated to be either 37 or 88 households; the families included 14 villagers, 15 smallholders, 6 slaves, a priest, a dyke builder (possibly working on the earthworks of the castle) and 52 burgesses. Some historians have argued that the number of 52 burgesses in Berkhamsted was a clerical error, as it is a large number for a small town. Berkhamsted was described in the Domesday Book as a burbium (ancient borough) in the Tring Hundred.() Marjorie Chibnall argued that Robert, Count of Mortain intended Berkhamsted to be both a commercial and a defensive centre; while John Hatcher and Edward Miller believed that the 52 burgesses were involved in trade, but it is unknown if the burgesses existed before the conquest.\n### Royal medieval castle (11th to 15th centuries)\nBerkhamsted Castle is a (now ruined) motte-and-bailey Norman castle. Radiocarbon dating of organic remains from within the Motte indicates that it was probably built post-1066 (a dyke builder is recorded in the town at the time of the Domesday Book). The castle was a high-status residence and an administrative centre for large estates (including the Earldom of Cornwall). Through the High and Late Middle Ages the close proximity of the royal castle and court helped fuel Berkhamsted's growth, prosperity and sense of importance. It created jobs for the local population, both within the castle itself and also, for example, in the large deer park and in the vineyard, which were maintained alongside the castle.\nAfter Robert, Count of Mortain, the castle passed to his heir William, who rebelled against Henry I and lost the castle to the king. In 1155 Henry in turn gave it to his favourite Thomas Becket, who held it till 1165. Becket was later alleged to have spent over £300 on improvements to the castle, a claim that led Henry to accuse him of corruption and may have contributed to his downfall. Henry II extensively used the castle, making it one of his favourite residences. Both King Richard I and King John gave the castle to their queens, Berengaria of Navarre and Isabella of Angoulême, respectively. In King John's reign, Geoffrey Fitz Peter (c. 1162–1213), Earl of Essex and the Chief Justiciar of England (effectively the king's principal minister) held the Honour and Manor of Berkhamsted from 1199 to 1212. During his time in the castle he was responsible for the foundation of the new parish church of St Peter (the size of which reflects the growing prosperity of the town); two hospitals, St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist (one of which was a leper hospital), which survived until 1516; and for the layout of the town.\nFollowing the signing of Magna Carta (1215), King John’s reneging on the royal charter, the castle was besieged during the ensuing civil war, known as the First Barons' War, between King John and barons supported by Prince Louis (the future Louis VIII of France), the French laid siege to Berkhamsted Castle (only a quarter of a mile from the town centre) in late December 1216. The queen's constable of the castle was the German Walerand Teutonicus.\n“After reducing the castle of Hertford, Louis marched on St Nicholas’s day (6 December) to the castle of Berkhamsted and surrounded it with his engines of war. Whilst the English barons, after pitching their tents, were employed in setting them in order, the knights and soldiers of the garrison made a sally, seized the baggage and conveyances of the barons and gained possession of the standard of William de Mandeville with which they returned to the castle, regretting that they could do no further injury to them. On the same day, whilst the barons were sitting at table, the knights and soldiers of the garrison again made a sally, and, in order to put the barons in confusion, they carried before them the standard which they had taken a short time before, and thought to come on them unawares, but the latter were forewarned of this, and drove them back to the castle. When the following day dawned Louis ordered the petrarie (stone-throwing machines) and other engines of war to be erected around the city, which being done, they kept up a destructive shower of stones: but Waleran, a German, well tried in warfare, made a brave resistance against them and caused great slaughter amongst the excommunicated French.\" The contemporary chronicler, Roger of Wendover, based at St Albans abbey, 12 miles from Berkhamsted, describing the siege\nDuring the siege, Prince Louis introduced a new destructive siege engine to England at Berkhamsted, the counterweight trebuchet (or Mangonel). After a siege of twenty days the young new King (Henry III) ordered his constable to surrender surrendered the castle to Louis on the 20 December. Following the siege at Berkhamsted Louis suffered several defeats. 11 September 1217 Louis signed the Treaty of Lambeth, relinquishing his claim to the English throne and surrendering French-held castles including Berkhamsted. Walerand went on to hold several other posts including the senior position of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.\nIn 1227, Henry III's younger brother, Richard of Cornwall, was given the manor and castle, beginning the long association of the castle with the Earls and later the Dukes of Cornwall.  Richard redeveloped the castle as a palatial residence and the centre for the administration of the Earldom of Cornwall. Richard's coat of arms as Earl of Cornwall, along with bezants, is included in Berkhamsted's coat of arms. Richard's wife, Sanchia of Provence, died in the castle in 1260. Richard was succeeded by his son, Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, who founded Ashridge Priory, a college of the monastic order of Bonhommes, in 1283. In 1300, after Edmund died, Edward I (\"Longshanks\") took the castle; he subsequently granted it to his second queen, Margaret of France. In 1309, Edward I's and Margaret's son, Edward II, granted Berkhamsted to his favourite, Piers Gaveston. In 1317, the castle was given to Edward II's queen, Isabella of France.\nEdward III further developed the castle and gave it (as part of the Duchy of Cornwall) to his son, Edward, the Black Prince, who expanded the hunting grounds. The castle was used to hold royal prisoners, including John II of France. In 1361, Edward the Black Prince and Joan, the Maid of Kent, spent their honeymoon in Berkhamsted. Under Edward the Black Prince, Berkhamsted become a centre of English Longbow archery. A decisive factor in the English victory at the Battle of Crécy (1346) was the introduction of this new weapon onto the Western European battlefield. The Longbow was a superior weapon to the cumbersome and slower crossbow. The Berkhamsted Bowmen successfully took part in this significant battle in medieval Western European history. The Black Prince was supported at the Battle of Crecy by local bowmen Everard Halsey, John Wood, Stephen of Champneys, Robert Whittingham, Edward le Bourne, Richard of Gaddesden and Henry of Berkhamsted (who was rewarded with 2d a day and appointed porter of Berkhamsted Castle after he saved the prince's baggage at the Battle of Poitiers). Richard II inherited Berkhamsted Castle in 1377 and gave it to his favourites, Robert de Vere and John Holland.\nIn 1400, Henry IV lived in the castle after he deposed Richard, and he used the castle to imprison others attempting to obtain the throne. During this time, Geoffrey Chaucer – later famous for writing The Canterbury Tales – oversaw renovation work on the castle in his role as Clerk of the Works at Berkhamsted. It is unknown how much time he spent at Berkhamsted, but he knew John of Gaddesden, who lived in nearby Little Gaddesden and was the model for the Doctor of Phisick in The Canterbury Tales. Henry V and Henry VI owned the castle, the latter making use of it until he was overthrown in 1461. In 1469, Edward IV gave the castle to his mother, Cecily Neville, Duchess of York. The arrival of Neville and her household at Berkhamsted had a significant social and financial impact on the town. Men and women from the town joined her service, such as Robert Incent who became her secretary and whose memorial brass can still be seen in St Peter’s Church in Berkhamsted. Mother to both Edward IV and Richard III, grandmother to Edward V, and mother in law to Henry VII, she was the last person to live in the castle.\n#### Recent history of the castle\nIn 1833, the castle was the first building to receive statutory protection in the United Kingdom. In 1834, construction of the railway embankment demolished the castle's gatehouse and adjacent earthworks. Today the castle ruins are managed by a charitable trust, the Berkhamsted Castle Trust, in partnership with English Heritage, on behalf of the Duchy of Cornwall (which still officially owns the site), and are freely open to the public.\n### Medieval market town (12th to 15th centuries)\nThe town continued to develop separately on the old Akeman Street 0.4 miles (0.6 km) to the south of the castle and to the west of St Peter's Church; with a triangle formed by Mill Street, Castle Street and Back Lane pointing towards the castle. In 1156, Henry II officially recognised Berkhamsted as a town in a royal charter, which confirmed the laws and customs enjoyed under Edward the Confessor, William I and Henry I, and freed the town's merchants from all tolls and dues. The charter also stated that no market could be set up within 7 miles (11 km) of the town.\nThe town became a trading centre on an important trade route in the 12th and 13th centuries, and received more royal charters. In 1216, Henry III relieved the men and merchants of the town from all tolls and taxes everywhere in England, and the English Plantagenet possessions in France, Normandy, Aquitaine and Anjou. The growing wool trade brought prosperity to Berkhamsted from the 12th century until the early Tudor period. Four wealthy Berkhamsted wool merchants were amongst a group in Bruges to whom Edward III wrote in 1332, and Berkhamsted merchants sold cloth to the royal court.\nIn 1217, Henry III recognised by royal charter the town's oldest institution, Berkhamsted's pre-existing market. Trades within medieval Berkhamsted were extensive: early in the 13th century the town had a merchant, two painters, a goldsmith, a forester, two farriers, two tailors, a brewer of mead, a blacksmith, carpenters, wood turners, tool makers, a manufacturer of roofing tiles and wine producers. In the mid–13th century, a banker, the wealthy Abraham of Berkhamsted, financier to the Earl of Cornwall, lived in the town; this was unusual for a small town in a time of heightened persecution of Jews.\nA 1290 taxation list mentions a brewer, a lead burner, a carpenter, leather workers, a fuller, a turner, a butcher, a fishmonger, a barber, an archer, a tailor, a cloth-napper, a miller, a cook, a seller of salt and a huntsman. At this time, larger houses of merchants and castle officials appeared on the south side of the high street (including 173 High Street, the oldest known extant jettied building in England). In 1307 Berkhamsted was a large town by English medieval standards with an estimated population of 2,000 to 2,500. In 1355, there were five butchers, two bakers, nine brewers, two cobblers, a pelter, a tanner, five cloth dyers, six wheelwrights, three smiths, six grain merchants, a skinner and a baker/butcher. In the 14th century, Berkhamsted (recorded as \"Berchamstede\") was considered to be one of the \"best\" market towns in the country. In a survey of 1357, Richard Clay was found to own a butcher's shop twelve feet (four metres) wide, William Herewood had two shops, and there were four other shops eight feet (two metres) in length. In 1440, there is a reference to lime kilns.\nThe town benefited when Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall founded Ashridge Priory in 1283, two miles (three kilometres) away and within the castle's park. At the foundation of the abbey, the Earl donated a phial claimed to contain Christ's blood. Pilgrims from all over Europe passed through the town to see the holy relic. The abbey grew quite wealthy as a result. Edward I held parliament at the abbey in 1290 and spent Christmas there. Berkhamsted burgesses sent two members to parliament in 1320, 1338 and 1341, but the town was not represented again. In the mid-14th century, the Black Prince took advantage of the Black Death to extend the castle's park by 65 acres (26 ha), eventually producing a park covering 991 acres (401 ha). In the 15th century, the town was reaffirmed as a borough by a royal charter granted by Edward IV (1442–1483), which decreed that no other market town was to be set up within 11 miles (18 km).\n### Castle abandoned, the town in decline (16th to late 18th centuries)\nIn the 16th century, the town fell into decline after abandonment of the castle following the death of Cicely Neville, Duchess of York in 1495, and the rise of the nearby town of Hemel Hempstead (which was granted a Charter of Incorporation by Henry VIII on 29 December 1539). The population of the town in 1563 has been estimated at only 545. In 1580, the castle ruins and the park were leased by Elizabeth I to Sir Edward Carey, for the nominal rent of one red rose each year. Stone from the castle was used to build Berkhamsted Place, a local school, and other buildings in the late 16th century. Brewing and maltings was noted as one of the town's principal industries in the reign of Elizabeth. Around 1583, a new market house was erected west of St Peter's Church at the end of Middle Row (alternatively named Le Shopperowe or Graball Row). The market house was destroyed in a fire in 1854.\nIn 1612, Berkhamsted Place was bought by Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales for £4,000. Henry died later that year, and bequeathed the house to his brother Charles (later King Charles I), who leased the property to his tutor, Thomas Murray, and his wife, Mary Murray, who had been his nurse and Lady of the Privy Chamber to the prince's mother. John Norden wrote in 1616 that the making of malt was then the principal trade of the town. In 1618, James I reaffirmed Berkhamsted's borough status with a charter. Following surveys in 1607 and 1612 the Duchy of Cornwall enclosed 300 acres (121 ha) from the Common (now known as Coldharbour farm) despite local opposition led by Rev Thomas Newman. In 1639 the Duchy tried to enclose a further 400 acres (162 ha) of the Berkhamsted and Northchurch Commons, but was prevented from doing so by William Edlyn of Norcott. The castle's park, which had reached 1,252 acres (507 ha) by 1627, was broken up over the next two decades, shrinking to only 376 acres (152 ha), to the benefit of local farmers. In 1643, Berkhamsted was visited by a violent pestilential fever.\nBorn in Berkhamsted, Colonel Daniel Axtell (1622 – 19 October 1660), a Baptist and a grocer's apprentice, played a zealous and prominent part in the English Civil War, both in England and in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. He participated as a lieutenant colonel in Pride's Purge of the Long Parliament (December 1648), arguably the only military coup d'état in English history, and commanded the Parliamentary Guard at the trial of King Charles I at Westminster Hall in 1649. During Cromwell's Protectorate, he appropriated Berkhamsted Place. Shortly after the Restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, the unrepentant Axtell was hanged, drawn and quartered as a regicide. After the Restoration, the town lost its charter granted by James I and its borough status. The surveyor of Hertfordshire recommended that a new tenant and army officers were needed at Berkhamsted Place \"to govern the people much seduced of late by new doctrine preacht unto them by Axtell and his colleagues.\" The population of the town in 1640 and in the 1690s was estimated at 1075 and 767, respectively. The town was a centre of religious nonconformity from the 17th century: over a quarter of the town were Dissenters in the second half of the century, and in 1700, there were 400 Baptists recorded as living in Berkhamsted. Three more shops are mentioned in the row next to the church, and the Parliamentary Survey of 1653 suggests that the area near the Market House was used for butchery.\n### Development of the modern town (19th and 20th centuries)\n#### 19th century urban growth\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries Hemel Hempstead, with its thriving market, eclipsed Berkhamsted as the major town in the area. Georgian Berkhamsted barely extended beyond the medieval triangle and the High Street. With the coming of the Industrial Age, Berkhamsted was well placed at a gateway through the Chilterns, between the markets of London and the industrial Midlands. The town became a link in the growing network of roads, canals and railways. These developments led Berkhamsted's population to expand once again. In 1801, the population of St Peter's parish had been 1,690 and by 1831, this had risen to 2,369 (484 houses). An 1835 description of the town found that \"the houses are mostly of brick, and irregularly built, but are interspersed with a fair proportion of handsome residences\". The town's population increased as \"hundreds of men arrived to build the railway line and needed lodging\"; by 1851, the population was 3,395, From 1850 large estates around Berkhamsted were sold, allowing for housing expansion. In 1851 the Pilkington Manor estate, east of Castle Street, was sold, and the land developed both as an industrial area and for artisans' dwellings. In 1868 streets of middle-class villas began to appear on the hill south of the High Street. Lower Kings Road was built by public subscription in 1885 to join Kings Road and the High Street to the station. In 1887, John Bartholomew's Gazetteer of the British Isles recorded the population at 4,485.\n#### 19th century industry and utilities\nIndustries in the 19th century included:\nTimber: In the mid-18th century, Berkhamsted had been noted for turned wood products. Based on the extensive woodland resources of the area (principally alder and beech), the milling and turning of wood was the town's most prominent industry in the 19th century. The Crimean War contracts for supplying the army with lance poles and tent pegs led to major expansion. The largest manufacturer was East & Sons. Brush making: An offshoot of the timber industry. The largest employers were Goss Brushworks at the west end of the High Street (closed 1930s) and T.H. Nash in George Street (closed 1920s). The Canal trade provided a considerable economic stimulus to the town, enabling the development of industries which involved bulk transport of materials. These included timber and malt. Boat building: Berkhamsted also became a centre for the construction of the barges needed for the canal trades. A yard for building canal barges and other boats, between Castle Street and Raven's Lane wharves, was one of three important boatyards in Hertfordshire. It was owned by John Hatton until 1880 and then by William Costin until 1910, when it was taken over by Key's, the timber merchants which in 1969 was bought by another timber merchant J. Alsford before being redeveloped into flats in 1994. At this site, next to the canal, is the Berkhamsted Canadian totem pole. Watercress: The construction of the canal had helped to drain the marshy areas along the valley of the River Bulbourne. In 1883, the Berkhamsted Times congratulated Mr Bedford on having converted the remaining \"dirty ditches and offensive marshes\" into watercress beds. Chemical: Cooper's sheep dip works. William Cooper was a vet who arrived in Berkhamsted in the early 1840s and experimented in treatments for scab in sheep. He formulated an innovative arsenic and sulphur sheep-dip. The Cooper family firm was later inherited by his nephew, Sir Richard Cooper, 1st Baronet. Nurserymen: Henry Lane's nurseryman business, founded in 1777, became one of the largest employers in the town in the 19th century. Extensive nurseries are shown on the 1878 Ordnance Survey 25 inch plan, at the western end of the town. Iron working: Wood's Ironworks was set up in 1826 by James Wood.\nUtilities in the 19th century included:\nGasworks: The Great Berkhamsted Gas, Light & Coke Co., at the junction of Water Lane and the Wilderness, was set up to provide street lighting in 1849. In 1906, the Berkhamsted Gas Works moved to Billet Lane; it closed in 1959. Water and sewage: The Great Berkhamsted Waterworks Company was set up in 1864 on the High Street (on the present site of W.H. Smith and Boots). Mains drainage was first supplied in 1898–99, when effective sewerage was installed.\n#### Provision for the destitute\nIn 1725 \"An Account of Several Workhouses\" records a parish workhouse in Berkhamsted, and a parliamentary report of 1777 refers to a parish workhouse for up to 34 inmates in Northchurch. A small \"wretched, straw-thatched\" house was used to house poor families in Berkhamsted, on the corner of what is now Park View Road, until it was demolished in the 1820s. In 1831 a bequest of £1,000 by the Revd George Nugent led to a new parish workhouse being set up on the site of a workhouse which had operated in a row of tenements on the High Street (at the Kitsbury Road junction) known as Ragged Row. The \"Berkhampstead Poor Law Union\" was formed in June 1835 covering ten parishes centred on the town. The Union took over the existing Berkhamsted parish workhouse, and by August 1835 it had become the sole workhouse for the union. The workhouse had no schoolroom, so in 1849 the Poor Law Board recommended that pauper children be sent to the local National School. However in 1858 the school complained about the state of the children attending from the workhouse. A fever ward was erected in 1855, and a full-time nurse was engaged in 1868. The workhouse system officially came to an end in 1930, and control over the workhouse was given to local council. Nugent House, the Berkhamsted workhouse, finally closed in 1935 and its function was relocated to Hemel Hemspstead. In 1841, the Countess of Bridgewater built a soup kitchen for the local poor within the ruins of Berkhamsted Castle. The soup kitchen was used by an estimated 15 per cent of the population of Berkhamsted (about 500 people) during the winter months, until at least 1897. The building still stands connected to the cottage in the castle grounds; why it was placed outside the town and inside the ruins of the historic castle is unknown.\n#### Land dispute: The Battle of Berkhamsted Common\nThe Battle of Berkhamsted Common played an important part in the preservation of common land nationally. After 1604 the former Ashridge Priory became the home of the Edgerton family. In 1808-1814 Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, demolished the old priory, and built a stately home, Ashridge House. In 1848 the estate passed to the Earls Brownlow, a branch of the Egerton family.\nIn 1866, Lord Brownlow of Ashridge House (encouraged by his mother, Lady Marian Alford) in an action similar to many other large estate holders tried to enclose Berkhamsted Common with 5-foot (1.5 m) steel fences (built by Woods of Berkhamsted) in order to claim the land as part of his family's estate. In response to the enclosure action and in defence the historic right of the public to use the ancient common land, Augustus Smith MP and George Shaw-Lefevre organised local people and 120 hired men from London's East End to dismantle the fences on the night of 6 March, in what became known nationally as the Battle of Berkhamsted Common.\nLord Brownlow brought a legal case against Smith for trespass and criminal damage, Smith was aided in his defence by Sir Robert Hunter (later co-founder of the National Trust in 1895) and the Commons Preservation Society. Lord Justice Romilly determined that pulling down a fence was no more violent an act than erecting one. The case, he said, rested on the legality of Brownlow's action in building the fence and the legal right of people to use the land. He ruled in favour of Smith. This decision, along with the Metropolitan Commons Act 1866, helped to ensure the protection of Berkhamsted Common and other open spaces nationally threatened with enclosure. In 1926 the common was acquired by the National Trust.\n#### First World War\nDuring the First World War, under the guidance of Lt Col Francis Errington, the Inns of Court Officers' Training Corps trained men from the legal profession as officers. Over the course of the war, 12,000 men travelled from Berkhamsted to fight on the Western Front. Their training included trench digging: 8 miles (13 km) of trenches were dug across the Common (of which 1,640 feet (500 m) remain). The Inns of Court War Memorial on the Common has the motto Salus Populi Suprema Lex—the welfare of the people is the highest law—and states that the ashes of Colonel Errington were buried nearby.\n#### 20th century urban developments\nIn 1909 Sunnyside and later in 1935 Northchurch were added to Berkhamsted Urban District. Shortly after 1918 much of the extensive estate belonging to Berkhamsted Hall, at the east end of the High Street, was sold; many acres west of Swing Gate Lane were developed with council housing. More council housing was built at Gossoms End. Development on the north side of the valley was limited until the sale of the Ashridge estate in the 1930s, after which housing appeared at each end of Bridgewater Road. In the second half of the 20th century, many of the old industrial firms in Berkhamsted closed, while the numbers of commuters increased.\nAfter the Second World War, in July 1946, the nearby town of Hemel Hempstead was designated a New Town under the New Towns Act (\"New Towns\" were satellite urban developments around London to relieve London's population growth and housing shortages caused by the Blitz). In February 1947 the Government purchased 5,910 acres (2,392 ha) of land and began construction. As a result Hemel Hempstead's population increased from 20,000 to over 90,000 today, making it the largest town in Hertfordshire. In 1974, the old hundred of Dacorum became the modern district of Dacorum formed under the Local Government Act 1972, based in Hemel Hempstead.\n## Geography\nBerkhamsted is situated 26 miles (42 km) northwest of London within the Chiltern Hills, part of a system of chalk downlands throughout eastern and southern England, believed to have formed between 84 and 100 million years ago in the Cretaceous Period when the area was a chalk-depositing marine environment. The town is located in a narrow northwest to southeast valley falling from 590 feet (180 m) above sea level to 344 feet (105 m). The valley is at the southernmost limit of the Pleistocene glaciation ice erosion throughout the Chiltern scarp, giving it a smooth rounded appearance, with alluvial soils in the valley bottom and chalk, clay and flint on the valley sides. In the early Mesolithic period (Middle Stone Age, mid to late 8th millennium BC), the local upland was mostly pine woodland and the low area of central Berkhamsted probably a grass-sedge fen. In the 6th Millennium BC the dense deciduous forest became well established. By the Mid to late 3rd millennium BC during the Neolithic period (the New Stone Age) human activity can be seen in wood clearances; the woodland being then dominated by lime trees, with alder trees growing on the flood plain. The River Bulbourne, a chalk stream, runs through the valley for 7 miles (11 km) in a southeast direction, starting at Dudswell and the adjoining village of Northchurch and running through Berkhamsted, Bourne End and Boxmoor, where it merges with the River Gade at Two Waters in Apsley, near Hemel Hempstead. Rich in eels and other fish, it was fast-moving and full, and prone to frequent localised flooding. The river created a marsh environment (at times referred to as an 'unhealthy swamp') in the centre of the valley. The river powered the watermills (recorded in 1086) and fed the three moats of the large Norman Motte and Bailey castle, that stands close to the centre of the town where a small dry combe joins the Bulbourne valley.\nThe countryside surrounding the town includes parts of the Green Belt and the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Urban Nature Conservation Study (UNCS) recognises the town's hinterland as a biodiversity resource. The hills gently rise to an undulating and open plateau, which has a mix of arable farmland, common land and mixed oak, ash and beech woodland. On the northeast side of town are the Berkhamsted and Northchurch commons, the largest in the Chilterns at 1,055 acres (427 ha), and forming a large arc running from Northchurch, through Frithsden and down to Potten End. Ownership of Berkhamsted Common is divided between the National Trust and Berkhamsted Golf Club. Beyond the common is the 5,000-acre (2,000 ha) historic wooded parkland of Ashridge; once part of Berkhamsted Castle's hunting park, it is now managed by the National Trust. Ashridge is part of the Chilterns Beechwood Special Area of Conservation (SAC), a nationally important nature conservation area, and is also designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Agriculture is more dominant to the south of the town; close to the Buckinghamshire border there are two former large country estates, Ashlyns and Rossway. The ancient woodland at Dickshills is also located here.\nThe layout of Berkhamsted's centre is typical of a medieval market settlement: the linear High Street (aligned on the Akeman Street) forms the spine of the town (roughly aligned east–west), from which extend medieval burgage plots (to the north and south). The surviving burgage plot layout is the result of a comprehensive plan carried out at the beginning of the 13th century, most probably instigated by Geoffrey fitz Peter. The town centre slowly developed over the years and contains a wide variety of properties that date from the 13th century onwards. The modern town began to develop after the construction of the Grand Junction Canal in 1798. The canal intersects the river at numerous points, taking most of its water supply and helping to drain the valley. The locality became further urbanised when the London to Birmingham railway was built in 1836–37. The townscape was shaped by the Bulbourne valley, which rises 300 feet (91 metres) on either side at its narrowest point; the residential area is elongated and follows the valley's topography. The southwest side of the valley is more developed, with side streets running up the steep hillside; on the northeast side, the ground gently slopes down to the castle, railway, canal and small river, was less available for development. Today, Berkhamsted is an affluent, \"pleasant town tucked in a wooded fold in the Chiltern Hills\"; with a large section of the settlement protected as a conservation area.\n### Neighbouring settlements\nTraveling on the high street away from the town, along the Bulbourne valley south-eastwards towards London, the A4251 road passes through the village of Bourne End and the large new town of Hemel Hempstead (8 miles (13 km) distant). To the south south-east is the large village of Bovingdon. Taking the A416 road south from Berkhamsted, along the Chiltern Hills into Buckinghamshire lies the nearby hamlet of Ashley Green and the fellow market towns of Chesham (4.7 miles (8 km) distant) and Amersham. Further southwest is the village of Great Missenden and to the west is the small market town of Wendover.\nAlong the A4251 and valley northwestwards is the adjoining village of Northchurch, and the hamlets of Dudswell and Cow Roast, the village of Wigginton and the small market town of Tring (6.7 miles (11 km) distant) and the county town of Buckinghamshire Aylesbury at (13.9 miles (22 km) distant). Following the Chiltern Hills northwards, to the north-northwest is the village of Aldbury; situated to the north of Berkhamsted are the villages of Ringshall and Little Gaddesden (5.4 miles (9 km) distant); finally located to the north-east of the town are the villages and hamlets of Potten End, Frithsden and Great Gaddesden. The nearest large settlements to the north of Berkhamsted are the Bedfordshire towns of Dunstable (11.1 miles (18 km) distant) and Luton (13.8 miles (22 km).\n### Climate\nLike most of the United Kingdom, Berkhamsted has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb).\nNear-real-time weather information can be retrieved from Berkhamsted Weather Station page on the Met Office Weather Observation website.\n## Governance\nBerkhamsted is within the South West Hertfordshire, UK Parliament constituency. Following the 2019 United Kingdom general election Gagan Mohindra (Conservative Party) is the constituency's current Member of Parliament (MP).\nBerkhamsted has a town council, the first tier of local government that represents the local people to two higher tiers of local government, Dacorum Borough Council and Hertfordshire County Council. The modern district of Dacorum based in Hemel Hempstead was formed in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972; the local government district's main population centres include Hemel Hempstead, Tring and the western part of Kings Langley. Berkhamsted accounts for just over 12 per cent of the district's population of 153,300 in 2017.\nBerkhamsted is split into three local government Wards—East, West and Castle. In the 2015 town council elections the political composition of the council was Conservative 12; Liberal Democrat 3. Following the 2019 town council elections the political composition of the council changed to Liberal Democrat 10; Conservative 3; Green 2. In the 2021 local elections on 6 May, the Berkhamsted seat at Hertfordshire County Council was won with 51.8 per cent of the vote by the Liberal Democrat Nigel Taylor, compared to the Conservative vote of 29.8per cent.\n### Administrative history\nBerkhamsted was an ancient borough, but lost this status in the seventeenth century. The town was then governed by its parish vestry until the nineteenth century, in the same way as most rural areas. In 1835 Berkhamsted was made the centre of a poor law union which covered the town and the surrounding parts of western Hertfordshire, as well as parts of Buckinghamshire. Under the Public Health Act 1872, sanitary districts were created, and the boards of guardians of poor law unions were made responsible for public health and local government for any part of their district not included in an urban authority. As Berkhamsted had no local board or other urban authority, it was therefore included in the rural sanitary district.\nIn 1893 the town petitioned for the creation of a local board covering both Berkhamsted and Northchurch parishes, which would make it independent of the rural sanitary authority. An inquiry was held by a government inspector in December 1893, but he advised against the scheme. Hertfordshire County Council therefore did not pursue it, although did comment that an urban authority covering just the town itself rather than the two whole parishes might be more favourably received.\nUnder the Local Government Act 1894, rural sanitary districts became rural districts on 28 December 1894, and so the town became part of the Berkhampstead Rural District. Parish councils were also established under the act, to take over the civil functions of the old vestries. The new parish councils came into being on 31 December 1894 if an election had been needed to choose the first parish councillors, as was the case at Berkhamsted. The first meeting of the parish council was held on 31 December 1894 at the Town Hall in Berkhamsted, with the first chairman of the parish council being Arthur Johnson, who was the rector of St Peter's Church in the town.\n### Berkhamsted Urban District (1898–1974)\nEfforts to make the town independent of the rural district council continued. Eventually it was agreed that the parish would be split into a \"Great Berkhampstead Urban\" parish, which would become an urban district, and a \"Great Berkhampstead Rural\" parish, which would remain in the Berkhampstead Rural District. These changes came into force on 15 April 1898. The first meeting of the Great Berkhampstead Urban District Council was held on 15 April 1898, with David Osborn being elected the council's first chairman. The Great Berkhampstead Rural parish ceded land to the urban district in 1935 and was abolished two years later, being split between Nettleden with Potten End, Northchurch, and Great Gaddesden on 1 April 1937.\nIn 1908 the urban district council acquired a builder's yard and former Wesleyan chapel at 135 High Street (renumbered 161 High Street around 1950) to act as its offices and meeting place. By the 1930s the council needed more space. In 1936 the council bought the shop adjoining the old chapel. Both buildings were demolished and the new Berkhamsted Civic Centre was built on the site, which formally opened on 14 October 1938.\nUntil 1937 the official name of the council's area was the \"Great Berkhampstead Urban District\". At a meeting on 15 April 1937 the council discussed whether to change the name. It was commented that the inclusion of the \"Great\" in particular caused problems for people looking for the council's telephone number in the directory. The spelling \"Berkhamsted\" was also the more commonly used by this time. The change of name to \"Berkhamsted Urban District\" was agreed, and came into effect on 19 July 1937. The neighbouring Berkhampstead Rural District followed suit a few months later, becoming Berkhamsted Rural District on 1 November 1937.\nBerkhamsted Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the district of Dacorum on 1 April 1974. Berkhamsted Town Council was created as a successor parish to the old urban district council. The town council continues to be based at the Civic Centre at 161 High Street.\n## Demography\n### Homes\nThe Hertfordshire Local Information System (HertsLIS) website (based on data from the Office for National Statistics and other UK government departments) has the following data regarding the 7,363 households in Berkhamsted in 2011. 72 per cent of homes were owner occupied (34 per cent owned outright and 38 per cent owned with a mortgage) compared to 63 per cent for England. 26.5 per cent of homes were rented (13 per cent each for social rented and private rented) compared to a national figure of 34.5 per cent. In 2011, 77 per cent of household spaces in Berkhamsted were houses or bungalows and 23 per cent were flats or maisonettes. 30 per cent of houses and bungalows were detached compared to 22 per cent nationally: 47 per cent of dwellings are semi-detached or terraced, compared to 55 per cent nationally. According to HertsLIS in the third quarter of 2017 the average price of houses and flats in Berkhamsted was £724,900, compared to £474,400 for Hertfordshire, and £304,500 for England. Detached houses were £1,070,600 compared to £424,400 nationally. Berkhamsted was shown as the best place to live in southeast England in the Sunday Times 'Best Places to Live 2018' list, with the average prices of different types of homes in Berkhamsted ranging from £273,760 for starter homes to £999,920 for family homes, with rents from £850 to £2,490 per calendar month.\nIn 2021 according to Rightmove the average cost of a home in Berkhamsted was £696,949. The majority of sales in the town were detached properties, with an average selling value of £1,076,244. The average terraced dwelling price was £563,291 and the average semi-detached properties went for £657,436. Overall, in 2021 property house prices in Berkhamsted were four per cent up on the previous year and five per cent up on the 2018 peak of £661,336.\n### Employment and economic wellbeing\nIn mid-2016, the Office for National Statistics estimated the working age population of Berkhamsted (males and females aged 16 to 64) as 11,400, i.e. 62 per cent of the town's population. People from Berkhamsted were employed as follows: 17.5 per cent worked as managers, directors and senior officials; 27.5 per cent professional occupations and 8.5 per cent in associate professional and technical occupations; 10 per cent were employed in administrative and secretarial occupations; 7 per cent in skilled trades; 6 per cent Caring, leisure and other service occupations; 5 per cent were in sales and customer service occupations; 3 per cent were in process, plant and machine operatives; and 5.5 per cent worked in elementary occupations.\nAccording to HertsLIS in 2011, 76 per cent of Berkhamsted residents between the ages of 16 and 74 were employed (of which: full-time, 43 per cent; part-time, 13 per cent; self-employed, 14 per cent); and 24 per cent economically inactive (retired, 13 per cent; long-term sick/disabled, 2 per cent). 1.5 per cent of Berkhamsted households included a person with a long-term health problem or disability, while nationally this figure is 4.05 per cent. In April 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics on benefit claimants by constituency, the number of claimants on Jobseeker's Allowance (unemployment benefit) in Berkhamsted's South West Hertfordshire parliamentary constituency was 1.7 per cent, compared to 7.8 per cent for the UK.\n### Diversity\nLooking at broad ethnic heritage in 2011, HertsLIS data found that 90 per cent of residents were described as white British. Of the remainder, 1 per cent were Irish, 4 per cent were of other white origin, 1.7 per cent were described as mixed or multiple ethnic, 2.1 per cent were Asian or Asian British, 0.3 per cent were black African/Caribbean or black British and 0.3 per cent were Arab or any other ethnic group. Regarding religious beliefs in 2011, of the 92 per cent of residents who stated a religious preference, 30 per cent were non-religious and 59 per cent were Christian; other faiths included 0.4 per cent Buddhist, 0.5 per cent Jewish, 0.5 per cent Muslim and 0.1 per cent Sikh.\n### Relationships and education\nIn 2011 the marital and civil partnership statuses of residents aged 16 and over were as follows: 28 per cent single, 56 per cent married, 0.1 per cent in a registered same-sex civil partnership, 2 per cent separated, 8 per cent divorced or legally dissolved same-sex civil partnership, and 6 per cent widowed or surviving partner from a same-sex civil partnership. Looking at the qualifications table, 12 per cent of residents had no qualifications, 10 per cent reached level 1, 13 per cent achieved level 2, 2 per cent had apprenticeship qualifications, 10 per cent were level 3 and 49 per cent achieved level 4 or above. In 2018 the Sunday Times found 76 per cent of young people went on to higher education.\n## Transport\n### Road\nIn 1762, this section of Akeman Street became part of the Sparrows Herne Turnpike Road, a main thoroughfare between London and Aylesbury; it was notorious for its rutted and pitted state, even after becoming a toll road. Many coaching inns thrived along its route, including, in Berkhamsted, the King's Arms (where the exiled King Louis XVIII of France carried on a romance with Polly Page, the innkeeper's daughter). The town's historic high street is now the A4251. A bypass, originally proposed in the 1930s, was opened in 1993 and the main A41 road now passes south-west of Berkhamsted. A study of car ownership in Berkhamsted, Northchurch and Tring found that 43–45 per cent of households had two or more cars, compared to the county average of 40 per cent and the national average of 29 per cent. Conversely, the proportion of households who did not own a car was 14–20 per cent (about 7 per cent lower than the national average). Local bus routes passing through Berkhamsted town centre provide links to Hemel Hempstead, Luton, Watford and Whipsnade Zoo. Services include the 30, 31, 62, 207, 500 (Aylesbury and Watford), 501, 502 and 532. Buses are managed by Hertfordshire County Council's Intalink transport service.\n### Canal\nIn 1798, the Grand Junction Canal (built by William Jessop) from the River Thames at Brentford reached Berkhamsted; it reached Birmingham in 1805. Castle Wharf, the port of Berkhamsted, on the south side of the canal between Ravens Lane and Castle Street, was the centre of the town's canal trade, navigation and boat building activities. It was a hub of the country's inland water transport system, linking the ports and industrial centres of the country. Goods transported included coal, grain, building materials and manure. Timber yards, boating wharves, breweries, boat building and chemical works flourished as a result of the canal, with over 700 workers employed locally. It is still known as the Port of Berkhamsted. Separately, Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater (the \"Canal Duke\" and \"father of the inland waterway system\"), lived in Ashridge, near Berkhamsted. The canal became part of the Grand Union Canal in 1929.\n### Railway\nIn 1834, after opposition from turnpike trusts and local landowners was resolved, the first Berkhamsted railway station was built by chief engineer Robert Stephenson. Though the castle was the first building to receive statutory protection from Parliament, the railway embankment obliterated the old castle barbican and adjacent earthworks. Most of the raw materials used to build the railway were transported by the canal. The present station was built in 1875 when the railway was widened. It is unusual, on its line, in that most of the original buildings have been retained. The 'large trunk station' is located immediately next to Berkhamsted Castle on one side and overlooks the Grand Junction Canal on the other. The station is situated 28 miles (45 km) north-west of London Euston on the West Coast Main Line.'\nOne and a half million journeys are made annually to and from Berkhamsted, the vast majority by commuters to and from London. Principal services, operated by West Midlands Trains, run between London Euston and Milton Keynes Central, with additional trains running to Northampton and Birmingham New Street. Southern also runs an hourly service direct to East Croydon, via Clapham Junction.\n## Economy and commerce\nIn 1986, farming, service and light industry were characteristic local employers. In 2015, schools and retail (predominantly Waitrose) were the town's largest employers; these are both situated in Berkhamsted Castle ward. The Berkhamsted West ward (especially around Billet Lane, close to the canal and railway) is where most of the town's small to medium-sized industrial firms are located. The British Film Institute (BFI) is an important local employer to the south of Berkhamsted. As in many settlements, local industry has declined and more people commute elsewhere to work. Of the employed residents living in both Berkhamsted and Tring, 35 per cent live and work in the towns, while 65 per cent commute to workplaces away from the towns, particularly to London. Of the 7,100 people who work in Berkhamsted, 58 per cent commute to Berkhamsted to work. In 2011, 9.5 per cent of Berkhamsted residents (aged 16 to 74 in employment) worked mainly at or from home; 52 per cent drove to work by car (2.5 per cent as a passenger in a car); 22 per cent travelled by public transport; and 13 per cent cycled or walked to work. In 2011, an average commute to work was 21 kilometres.\nIn November 2014, the Academy of Urbanism's Urbanism Awards found Berkhamsted's High Street to be a \"vibrant\" and \"bustling\" road, which \"worked extremely well as a quality high street.\" They considered the layout for the street to be exemplary for its time (it was put in place after the bypass was built in the early 1990s), creating a \"pleasant\" and \"successful\" shopping environment and providing a good \"range of specialist shops and numerous cafes, restaurants and pubs\", together with the \"strong supermarket\" offering set in \"well-crafted re-configured streetscape\". The long high street had 100 per cent retail occupancy, independent traders and a \"cafe culture\". The Academy considered the good working collaboration between individual businesses and the Chamber of Trade to be a particularly strong aspect of the street. In the 2017 Vitality Index of 1000 retail locations in the UK carried out by Harper Dennis Hobbs, Berkhamsted was ranked as the 16th best shopping location in the country; in 2021, it ranked 9th. The index measured the quality of retail locations, including factors such as how well the retail mix met the needs of the local community, the number of vacant shops, and the proportion of 'undesirable' shops such as pawnbrokers and bookmakers. Coming top in the south-east region in Sunday Times 2018 Best Places to Live, Berkhamsted was described as \"affluent and attractive; its medieval centre is filled with chic shops and great places to eat\", with 76 per cent of shops being independent stores. Berkhamsted has an active Transition Town community.\n## Education\n### Independent schools\nBerkhamsted School is an independent public school. It was founded in 1541 by Dean John Incent, (c. 1480–1545) Born in Berkhamsted circa 1480, John Incent was the Dean of St Paul's Cathedral in London from 1540 to 1545 (during the early years of the English Reformation).\nIncent was noted as one of the agents of the Lord Chancellor Thomas Cromwell responsible for the sequestration of religious properties during the Dissolution of the Monasteries Incent financed the foundation of Berkhamsted school from the combined revenues of the town's two medieval hospitals, St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist, which he had closed down in 1516. In 1523 he took the lands of the two former hospitals and joined them to his own land, donating the enlarged estate towards the creation of a school. In 1541 he obtained a royal charter for \"one chauntry perpetual and schools for boys not exceeding 144 to be called Dean Incent's Free School in Berkhamstedde\". John Incent died intestate 18 months after his school opened. To protect the school from legal challenges, school was incorporated by an Act of Parliament as The Free Schole of King Edwarde the Sixte in Berkhampstedde. Amongst the school's former students was the author Graham Greene. The school's oldest building, the Old Hall, was built in 1544 and is Grade I listed. Contemporary records state that Incent \"builded with all speed a fair schoole lartge and great all of brick very sumptuously\", and \"when ye said school was thus finished, ye Deane sent for ye cheafe men of ye towne into ye school where he kneeling gave thanks to Almighty God\". In 1988 the school merged with Berkhamsted School for Girls (another large independent private school in the town), which had been founded in 1888. The school has 1,500 fee paying pupils, aged 3 to 18.\nEgerton Rothesay School, an independent school founded in 1922, has 150 pupils between the ages of 5 and 19.\n### State schools\nIn the 1970s, the town adopted a three-tier state school education system, but reverted to the two-tier system of primary and secondary schools in 2013.\nPrimary schools are: Victoria (founded in 1838), Bridgewater, Greenway, St Thomas More, Swing Gate, Thomas Coram and Westfield. The secondary school is Ashlyns School, a Foundation school with 1,200 pupils aged 11 to 19 years; it is a specialist language college. The school started in the 18th century, when Thomas Coram, a philanthropic ship's captain, was appalled by the abandoned babies and children starving and dying in London. He campaigned for a hospital to accommodate them and was successfully granted a royal charter \"for the Maintenance and Education of Exposed and Deserted Children\" in 1739. Three years later, in 1742, he established the Foundling Hospital at Lamb's Conduit Fields in Bloomsbury, London. It was the first children's charity in the country and a precedent for incorporated associational charities everywhere. The school moved to its purpose-built location in Berkhamsted in 1935. The residential home side at Berkhamsted closed following the Children Act 1948, when family-centred care replaced institutional care. In 1951 Hertfordshire County Council took over running the school. The large school contains stained glass windows, especially around the chapel, a staircase and many monuments from the original London hospital. The school's chapel formerly housed an organ donated by George Frideric Handel. The school was used a backdrop to the 2007 comedy film, Son of Rambow.\n### Business school\nAshridge Executive Education is located in the Grade I listed Ashridge House, the former stately home of the Duke of Bridgewater, set in 190 acres (77 hectares) of rolling parkland, 2 miles outside Berkhamsted. The house occupies the site of the earlier Ashridge Priory, a college of the monastic order of Bonhommes founded in 1283 by Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, who resided in the castle. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Henry VIII bequeathed the property to his daughter, Elizabeth. In 1800, it was the home of Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, affectionately known as the Father of Inland Navigation.Ashridge House was constructed between 1808 and 1814 to a design by James Wyatt with later work by his nephew Jeffrey Wyattville. Architecture critic Nikolaus Pevsner described it as the \"largest of the romantic palaces near London ... a spectacular composition\". In 1928 Urban Hanlon Broughton purchased the house as a gift for the Conservative Party intended to commemorate Bonar Law. For its first 15 years, it became a \"College of Citizenship\" established to help the party develop its intellectual forces in struggles with socialist organisations such as the Fabian Society. It became a cross between a think-tank and a training centre, and Arthur Bryant was its educational adviser.\nIn 2015 Ashridge merged with Hult International Business School, an American business school with campuses in seven cities around the world. Its activities include open and tailored executive education programmes, MBA, MSc and Diploma qualifications, organisation consulting, applied research and online learning. Ashridge is the only UK specialist business school with degree awarding powers, giving it the equivalent status to a university in awarding its degrees.\n## Religious sites\nThe oldest extant church locally is St Mary's in the adjacent village of Northchurch. Between 1087 and 1104, there is reference to a chaplain called Godfrey and to a chapel of St James with parochial status within St Mary's Berkhamsted's parish. The chapel situated close to St Johns, located close to St John's Lane, was the base for a small community of monks, the Brotherhood of St John the Baptist, in the 11th and 12th centuries.\nDuring King John's reign, Geoffrey Fitz Peter, was instrumental in the foundation the parish church of St Peter, and in 1222, Robert de Tuardo, was registered as the first known rector. Because of the church's proximity to the castle, the reigning monarch was patron of Berkhamsted rectors for several centuries. In 1648, St Peter's Church was requisitioned during the English Civil War by General Fairfax as a military prison to hold soldiers captured from the siege of Colchester. The poet William Cowper was christened in St Peter's, where his father John Cowper was rector.\nThe parish church of St Peter, which stands on the high street, is one of the largest churches in Hertfordshire. The church is in the Latin cross plan, with an 85-foot (26 m) clock tower at the crossing and measures 56 yards (51 m) from the west door to the east window, and the width across the transepts is 30 yards (27 m). The oldest part of the church is the chancel, which is dated at c. 1200; it is in the Early English style common in that period. Further additions were made up until the 15th century; in 1871, it underwent a restoration by William Butterfield. There are two altar tombs with alabaster effigies dating from the 14th century: the tombs are of a knight (thought to be Henry of Berkhamsted, one of the Black Prince's lieutenants at the Battle of Crecy) and his lady. There are two other Anglican churches in the town – 'St Michael and All Angels' (Sunnyside)(original building 1886) and 'All Saints' Church & St Martha's' (built in 1906, to cater for the growing population in the west end of the town). In 1842 a detached churchyard to St Peter's Church was established, using land to the rear of Egerton House (where the Rex cinema now stands) on Rectory Lane. It expanded to 3.275 acres and was phased out of use in 1976.\nThe town has a strong Non-conformist tradition, in 1672 a survey found that there were 400 Anglian conformists and 150 Non-conformists in Berkhamsted, when such beliefs could bring you foul of the law. The Baptist community in Berkhamsted, dates from 1640 making it one of the oldest nationally; first gathering in secret, they built a large chapel in 1722, and moved to their current place of worship at the junction of Ravens Lane on the High Street in 1864. A Quaker community is present in the town from the second half of the 17th century, they opened their Meeting House in 1818 on the High Street opposite St John's Well Lane. The Congregationlists can be traced back to 1780, they now worship combined with the Presbyterian church at St Andrew's United Reformed Church on the corner of Castle Street and Chapel Street. The Methodists arrived with the hundreds of men who came to build the railway, via various places of worship, today they share All Saints' Church with the Anglians. The Evangelist (Latter Day Saints) began life has part of the Plymouth Bretheren, their Hope Hall opened in 1875, which was rechristened the Kings Road Evangelical Church in 1969. The Roman Catholic tradition from the 17th to 20th century appears to be limited, General de Gaulle worshiped at their original Church of the Sacred Heart in Park View Road, they moved to a larger modern church in 1980 on Park Street.\n## Culture and leisure\n### Literary connections\nGeoffrey Chaucer was clerk of works at Berkhamsted Castle from 1389 and based his Doctor of Phisick in The Canterbury Tales on John of Gaddesden, who lived in nearby Little Gaddesden. William Cowper was born in Berkhamsted Rectory in 1731. Although he moved away when still a boy, there are frequent references to the town in his poems and letters. In the Victorian era, Cowper became a cult figure and Berkhamsted was a place of pilgrimage for his devotees. Maria Edgeworth, a prolific Anglo-Irish writer of adults' and children's literature who was a significant figure in the evolution of the novel in Europe, lived in Berkhamsted as a child in the 18th century. Between 1904 and 1907, the Llewelyn Davies boys were the inspiration for the author and playwright J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan. A little later, novelist Graham Greene was born in Berkhamsted and educated at Berkhamsted School, alongside literary contemporaries Claud Cockburn, Peter Quennell, Humphrey Trevelyan and Cecil Parrott. Children's authors H. E. Todd and Hilda van Stockum both lived in Berkhamsted. The comic character Ed Reardon from Radio 4's semi-naturalistic radio drama Ed Reardon's Week resides in Berkhamsted.\n### Cinema\nThe Rex Cinema is regarded by some, including The Daily Telegraph, as Britain's most beautiful cinema. Described by Dame Judi Dench as \"absolutely awe-inspiring\", in 2014, the Rex was declared Britain's Best Cinema in the inaugural Guardian film awards. Built in 1937 the Rex is recognised by English Heritage as a fine example of a 1930s art deco cinema. The cinema was designed by architect David Evelyn Nye for the Shipman and King circuit. Closed in 1988, the cinema was extensively restored in 2004 and has become a thriving independent local cinema. The Rex frequently has sold-out houses for evening showings, the cinema is a \"movie palace with all the original art deco trimmings\" (its interior features decorations of sea waves and shells). Inside is a step \"back into the golden age of film\" when going to the movies was an experience; the cinema features luxurious seating and two licensed bars. It is managed by its owner James Hannaway, who introduces films. Sometimes there is a question and answer session with directors and actors involved in the films; these sessions have included Dame Judi Dench, Charles Dance, Mike Leigh and Terry Jones.\nPrior to the cinema's construction, an Elizabethan mansion, Egerton House, had occupied the site at the east end of the high street for 350 years. The house was occupied briefly (1904–07) by Arthur and Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, whose children were J. M. Barrie's inspiration for Peter Pan.\n### British Film Institute National Archive at King's Hill\nRarely open to the public, the BFI National Archive's \"The J. Paul Getty, Jr. Conservation Centre\" in Berkhamsted is the archive of the British Film Institute. With over 275,000 feature, non-fiction and short films (dating from 1894) and 210,000 television programmes, it is one of the largest film archives in the world. Two of the archive's collections were added to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) UK Memory of the World Register, in 2011. The archive collects, preserves, restores and shares the films and television programmes which have shaped and recorded British life and times since the development of motion picture film in the late 19th century. The majority of the collection is British-originated material, but the archive also features internationally significant holdings from around the world and films that feature key British actors and the work of British directors.\n### Sport and outdoor pursuits\nThe town benefits in having a large National Trust Common and woodland on its long north east border. Running east–west through the centre of the town, along the town's length the Grand Union Canal (once an important trade artery) today it provides an open space with recreational opportunities, and acts with the small River Bulbourne as a wildlife corridor through the town. Other long standing public green spaces are the castle and Butts Meadow. In 2016 The Friends of St Peter's Berkhamsted received £907,000 in a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Big Lottery Fund from the National Lottery (United Kingdom) to repurpose the Rectory Lane Cemetery - as one of 12 sites across the country sharing £32m. The grant is to restored heritage features and create a new green community space in the town.\nThe Berkhamsted Bowmen are the oldest archery club in England. Founded in 1875 Berkhamsted Cricket Club competes in the Herts League and in 2015 it ran twenty-five separate teams. The club is based at the Berkhamsted Community Cricket and Sports Club, Kitcheners Field, Castle Hill, Berkhamsted. The nine Berkhamsted and Hemel Hempstead Hockey Club teams are based just outside the town at Cow Roast, playing their matches on their astroturf pitch at the club grounds in Cow Roast. There are two Bowls clubs, Berkhamsted and Kitcheners.\nThe town's football club, Berkhamsted FC, play in the Southern Football League Division One Central, part of the 8th Level in the English League (the town's football ground is at Broadwater). The team was formed in 2009 after the demise of Berkhamsted Town FC, which had been established in 1895. Founded in 1996, Berkhamsted Raiders CFC football club was recognised as the FA Charter Standard Community Club of the Year at the English Football Association Community Awards in 2014 and awarded the UEFA Grassroots Silver Award in 2015 for their work across the local community. The club in 2015 had more than 800 affiliated players, including 90 girls and 691 boys in the youth set-up, 29 ladies, 20 seniors and 20 veterans: who are spread across 65 teams at different levels.\nThere is a sports centre off Douglas Gardens, managed by the Dacorum Sports Trust (Sportspace). The facilities comprise a large indoor multi-purpose sports hall, squash courts, swimming pool and outdoor all-weather pitch. This facility is complemented by dual use of the leisure facilities of Ashlyns School and Berkhamsted Collegiate School. A deficit in leisure space is compounded by a high level of sports participation locally and consequent heavy use of outdoor sports pitches. Berkhamsted and the surrounding area has a variety of road cycling and mountain biking routes, including traffic-free off-road routes in Ashridge Estate. The town was visited by the Tour of Britain in 2014.\n## Sites of interest\nThe majority of Berkhamsted's eighty-five listed or scheduled historical sites are on in the high street and the medieval core of the town (a significant number of them contain timber frames). Four are scheduled, one is Grade I, seven are Grade II*, the remaining 75 are Grade II. In addition to the sites noted in the article above (such as the castle and schools) the following structures and locations are of interest:\n173 High Street is a Victorian façade hiding what is considered to be the oldest extant jettied timber-framed building in Great Britain, dated by dendrochronology of structural timbers to between 1277 and 1297. The building was originally thought to have been a jeweller or goldsmith's shop with a workshop behind. It is now believed to have been a jettied service wing to a larger aisled hall house, which has since disappeared. It represents an early example of transition in carpentry technology, from the use of passing braces to crown posts. The 13th century origin of the structure was discovered by chance in 2000 by builders who had begun work on what appeared to be a Victorian property. The shop was, from 1869, Figg's the Chemists; post-restoration (with expertise and a £250,000 grant from English Heritage), the shop is currently used as an estate agency. Dr Simon Thurley, Chief Executive of English Heritage, said \"This is an amazing discovery. It gives an extraordinary insight into how Berkhamsted High Street would have looked in medieval times.\" 125 High Street, a house and shop opposite St Peter's Church, is a timber-framed building with a wing that is one bay of a 14th-century open hall. The layout suggests that it once had a second bay of similar size – a length of 26 feet (8 m) in all. This was an unusually large house; its size and central position suggests a manor house or other high status house, possibly supporting the castle. The building underwent extensive alterations in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The Swan, 139 High Street, contains the remains of a medieval open hall. Parts of the roof date from the 14th century, and the street range was extended and a chimney stack added c. 1500. It sits on the ancient junction with the old Roman road of Akeman Street (High Street) and the main route between Berkhamsted and Windsor Castle (Chesham Road). Castle Street began life as the medieval lane from the town's high street to the drawbridge of the royal castle. At the other end of the lane was the parish church of St Peters. In the 16th century, next to the church, Berkhamsted school was founded, while in the 17th century there were seven public houses among the street's trade outlets. To the northwest of Berkhamsted stand the ruins of Marlin's Chapel, a 13th-century chapel next to a medieval fortified farm. The walls and moat surrounding the modern farm still remain and are reputed to be haunted.\n129 High Street is the Grade II* listed house known as Dean Incent's House. (John Incent, Dean of St Paul's, founded Berkhamsted School.) A 15th century half-timbered house, the interior has original exposed timber framing and several Tudor wall paintings. The building incorporates part of an even older structure and was used as public meeting place before the Court House was built. The house is not normally open to the public. The Court House, next to the church, dates from the 16th century, and is believed to lie on the site of the medieval court where the Portmote  or Borough Court was held. Sayer's Almshouses, were the legacy of John Sayer, chief cook to Charles II, at 235–241 High Street, comprise a single-storey row of almshouses built in 1684. The Bourne School, at 222 High Street, was the legacy by Thomas Bourne (1656–1729) (Master of the Company of Framework Knitters) to build a charity school in Berkhamsted for 20 boys and 10 girls. The front was rebuilt in 1854 in Jacobean-style red brick; it is not clear if any part of the building predates 1854. In 1875, the pupils were transferred to the National School and the funds used for scholarships. The site now occupied by the Pennyfarthing Hotel dates from the 16th century, having been a monastic building used as accommodation for religious guests passing through Berkhamsted or going to the monastery at Ashridge. Berkhamsted Town Hall, a Victorian gothic market house and town hall, designed by architect Edward Buckton Lamb (built in 1859, extended in 1890, restored in 1983–1999), was built by public subscription from Berkhamstedians. It comprised a market hall (now the Copper House restaurant), a large assembly hall and rooms for the Mechanics' Institute. When Berkhamsted became part of the new Dacorum Borough Council (based in Hemel Hempstead), there were plans to demolish the building, these plans were stopped by a ten-year citizens' campaign during the 1970s and 1980s, which eventually ended at the High Court.\nThe Berkhamsted Canadian totem pole sits adjacent to the canal, close to Castle Street Bridge. In the early 1960s, Roger Alsford, a great-grandson of the founder of the timber company, James Alsford (1841–1912), went to work at the Tahsis lumber mill on Vancouver Island. During a strike, he was rescued from starvation by a local Kwakiutl community. Alsford's brother, William John Alsford, visited the island, and in gratitude for the local people's hospitality, commissioned a totem pole from the Canadian First Nations artist Henry Hunt. The western red cedar pole, 30 feet (9 m) high and 3 feet (1 m) in diameter, was carved by Hunt at Thunderbird Park, a centre for First Nation monuments. The completed pole was shipped to Britain and erected at Alsford's Wharf in 1968. Alsford's warehouses were replaced in 1994 by a private housing development which limit access to the pole, so that it can be viewed only at a distance from the public road. It is one of only a handful of totem poles in the United Kingdom, others being on display at the British Museum and Horniman Museum in London, Windsor Great Park, Bushy Park and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park. The carvings on the totem pole represent four figures from First Nations legend: at the top sits Raven, the trickster and creator deity; he sits on the head of Sunman, who has outstretched arms representing the rays of the sun and wears a copper (a type of ceremonial shield); Sunman stands on the fearsome witch-spirit Dzunukwa; at the base is the two-headed warrior sea serpent, Sisiutl, who has up-stretched wings. Ashridge is a country estate and stately home. Ashridge House is a large Gothic Revival country house built between 1808 and 1814. Since 2015 it has been the home of Hult International Business School's Ashridge Executive Education programme (see above for more information about the building). The surrounding country estate is a park managed by the National Trust, consisting of 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) of native broadleaf woodlands, commons and chalk downland on a Chiltern ridge just to the north of Berkhamsted. Ashridge has been featured many times in film and television series due to its distinction as an area of natural beauty. Scenes were filmed for Sleepy Hollow at Golden Valley and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire at Ashridge's ancient Frithsden Beeches Wood. The climbable monument to Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, a tall Doric column with urn (a Grade II* listed building), stands in a grove within Ashridge.\n## Associations with the town\n### Twin towns\nBerkhamsted is twinned with:\nBeaune, Burgundy, France Neu Isenburg, Hesse, Germany (as part of Dacorum)\nThe town also has an informal relationship with Barkhamsted, Connecticut, in the United States.

{"name": "Camp Clipper", "documents": ["# Camp Clipper\nThe Camp Clipper and Camp Essex were sub camps of the US Army Desert Training Center in Riverside County, California. The main headquarters for the Desert Training Center was Camp Young. This is where General Patton's 3rd Armored Division was stationed. Camp Clipper was designated a California Historic Landmark (No.985.5). The site of Camp Clipper is at the Fenner Rest Area in Fenner, California, on Interstate 40, 32 miles (51 km) west of Needles in San Bernardino County, California, near Clipper Mountains. Currently at the south end of the Mojave National Preserve. Camp Clipper was just to the east of Camp Essex. Clipper was a temporary camp for incoming and out going troops. Camp Essex was named after a small town near the camp, Essex, San Bernardino County, California. Near Camp Clipper was the 4,500 foot Camp Essex Army Airfield.\nBuilt in 1942, Camp Essex and Camp Clipper were built to prepare troops to do battle in North Africa to fight the Nazis during World War II. At Camp Clipper were trained the 93rd Infantry Division. The trained troops went on to fight in the North African campaign. There was a temporary camp built for the training of the 33rd Infantry Division. When completed the camp had 36 shower buildings, outdoor theater, 191 latrines, 149 wooden tent frames, and a 50,000-gallon water tank. Also built was a 500,000 gallon concrete reservoir and two 740-foot-deep wells. Camp had 14 training ranges. The camp was used shortly in 1944 for Italian prisoners of war. The camp closed on 16 March 1944 and is now overseen by the Bureau of Land Management. The army used live-fire exercises and warning signs are still on the site.\nOperating Camp Essex:\n356th Engineer General Service Regiment (AGF) Company A Company E Trained at the camp: 93rd Infantry Division from July of 193 to October 1943\nOperating Camp Clipper:\n16th Special Service Company (AGF) 2nd Service Platoon 605th Engineer Camouflage Battalion (AGF) Company C Trained at the camp: 33rd infantry Division from April 1943 to July 1943\n\n## Camp Essex Army Airfield\nThere was an air strip near Camp Clipper to support training activities. The runway was a two 4,500 feet long runs made of steel landing mats with 6 parking pads at each end of the runway. The runway was a position north-south, parallel to the old U.S. Route 66 and Camp Clipper. The runway was from use for small planes, like the L-4 Piper Aircraft so the vast training grounds could be watched from the air. The runway was long enough for the large planes to used in training exercises like the: Douglas C-50 cargo plane, Douglas A-20 Havoc, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Lockheed P-38 Lightning and Consolidated B-24 Liberator. In early 1950 the airfield was used as a private airfield, being not maintain it was abandoned in the late 1950s.\n## Marker\nMarker at the Eastbound Rest Stop in California reads:\nNO. 985 DESERT TRAINING CENTER, CALIFORNIA-ARIZONA MANEUVER AREA (ESTABLISHED BY MAJOR GENERAL GEORGE S.

{"name": "Edge Hill, Warwickshire", "documents": ["# Edge Hill, Warwickshire\nEdge Hill is an escarpment and Edgehill a hamlet in the civil parish of Ratley and Upton, Stratford-on-Avon District, southern Warwickshire, England.\nEdge Hill gave its name to the first battle of the English Civil War, in which it was a prominent feature.\nThe hamlet has a public house, an eccentric building of local Hornton Stone called the Castle Inn that was built in the 1740s to the designs of Sanderson Miller (1716–80). It is controlled by the Hook Norton Brewery.\n## Battle\nThe narrow wood on the scarp of Edge Hill, in the south-east overlooks the lower slope and the plain on which the battle was fought.\nThe battle of Edge Hill was fought on Sunday 23 October 1642 and was the first major battle in the English Civil War between the Royalist forces of King Charles I and the Parliamentarian army commanded by the Earl of Essex.\nThe King's army started the day on the plateau above the scarp and Parliament's front line was about 2,200 yards (2,000 m) away. From Edge Hill, the ground drops steeply, levels out, then rises to Battleton Holt and a little beyond it are the Oaks and Graveground Copice. It was across the latter two that Parliament's army was drawn up (grid reference SP346485 to SP367498). The King's forces descended from the escarpment and faced them, extended between the end of the spur at Knowle End and Brixfield Farm (SP349472 to SP376491). The King's army had to descend from the edge of the escarpment if they wished to engage the Parliamentarians in battle, because the escarpment was far too steep for Essex to consider an attack against the Royalist army while it was on the edge.

{"name": "Bagh, Dhar", "documents": ["# Bagh, Dhar\nBagh is a census town in Dhar district in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. It is known for the Bagh Caves, which are late 4th- to 6th-century Buddhist rock-cut chambers with murals. The name of the town stems from the caves - according to local legend there were living tigers (bagh in several languages of India) in these abandoned Buddhist caves.\n## History\nIn 1982, a hoard of 27 inscriptions issued by the Maharajas of Valkha was discovered at Risawala near Bagh. The inscriptions were issued from a place known as Valkha, which has led to suggestions that the name \"Bagh\" is derived from \"Valkha\". The inscriptions are dated to the years 38-134 of an unspecified calendar era. Historians D. C. Sircar and R. C. Majumdar theorized that the Maharajas of Valkha were subordinates to the Guptas, and the calendar era used in their inscription is the Gupta era starting from 319 CE. Thus, the Maharajas of Valkha can be dated to 4th and 5th centuries CE.\nThe next known ruler of the region is Maharaja Subandhu of Mahishmati. His Bagh Caves inscription is dated 167 (486 CE, assuming Gupta era). Art historian Walter M. Spink has identified Subandhu as the prince Vishruta mentioned in Dashakumaracharita. According to his theory, Subandhu or Vishruta was a Gupta prince, who established the dynasty that later came to be known as Kalachuri.\n## Transport Connectivity\n### By Train\nNearest Railway stations are Dahod 100 km., Indore 150 km., Meghnagar 104 km., Ratlam 150 km, Khandwa 220 km.\n### By Road\nBagh is well connected to Indore by road and Daily Bus Services.\n### By airport\nThe nearest airport is Indore.\n## Bagh Printing\nThe Khatris are a community whose inward beings dance the Sufi way.

Originally Ajrakh printers they ventured into places to sell their fabrics and their enterprising ways kept them upfloat. From Larkana in Sind (today's Pakistan) to Pali, to the Marwadi Thar, to Manawar in Madhya Pradesh, their journey came to a stop and they settled down in Bagh in 1962, as they saw their grandfather and uncles returning to their ancestral land (Karachi, Pakistan) during Partition\nBagh is located at 22°22′N 74°46′E﻿ / ﻿22.37°N 74.77°E﻿ / 22.37; 74.77.

{"name": "Saugus, Massachusetts", "documents": ["# Saugus, Massachusetts\nSaugus is a town in Essex County, Massachusetts, United States, in the Greater Boston area. The population was 28,619 at the 2020 census. Saugus is known as the site of the first integrated iron works in North America.\n## History\nNative Americans inhabited the area around Saugus for thousands of years prior to the arrival of European settlers in the 1620s. At the time of European arrival, the Naumkeag, also known as Pawtucket, under the leadership of Montowampate were based near present day Saugus and controlled land extending from what is now Boston to the Merrimack River. English settlers took the name Sagus or Saugus from the Pawtucket word for \"outlet,\" and used the term to refer to the Saugus River and the region that includes the present day cities and towns of Swampscott, Nahant, Lynn, Lynnfield, Reading, North Reading and Wakefield) which were later renamed Lin or Lynn in 1637, after King's Lynn in Norfolk, England.\nIn 1646, the Saugus Iron Works, then called Hammersmith, began operations. It was the first integrated iron works in North America as well as one of the most technologically advanced in the world. The Iron Works produced over one ton of iron a day, but was not financially successful. It closed around 1670.\nIn September 1687, Major Samuel Appleton was said to have given a speech from a rocky cliff near the Iron Works denouncing the tyranny of Colonial Governor Sir Edmund Andros. The place where he is said to have delivered the speech became known as Appleton's Pulpit.\nNearly 100 men from Saugus fought in the American Revolutionary War. Saugus' preacher, Parson Joseph Roby, worked to strengthen the spirit of independence in Saugus and was instrumental in seeing that Saugus sent a large contingent to fight in the war.\nThe nineteenth century ice industry began in Saugus when in 1804 Frederic Tudor cut ice from a pond on the family farm and shipped it to Martinique.\nIn 1805 the Newburyport Turnpike (now U.S. 1) was built. About four miles of this road was built in Saugus. At first the turnpike was considered a mistake, as it was built over hills and swamps and grass soon grew over the road bed. From 1840 to 1846, the tolls were discontinued and it became a public highway. The invention of the automobile resulted in an increase of traffic on the Turnpike. In 1933 the road was widened and an overpass was added to separate the traffic on Route 1 and Main Street. In the 1950s new businesses began moving to Route 1. Today the businesses along Route 1 generate millions in dollars for Saugus.\nThe Lynn territory was shortened beginning in 1814 with the incorporation of Lynnfield. On February 17, 1815, present-day Saugus was officially incorporated as a town. The first town meeting was held on March 13, 1815, in the parish church. At the time of its incorporation, Saugus' population was 784. Its main industry was agriculture.\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, many new industries moved to Saugus. Shoes and woolen goods were made in Saugus Center, and tobacco was manufactured in Cliftondale and East Saugus.\nSaugus' first post office was established in 1832 in East Saugus. In 1858 two more were established—one in Saugus Center and one in Cliftondale. Now only the Cliftondale post office remains in Saugus.\nThe first town hall was built in 1837. It was built with $2,000 of the United States revenue surplus distributed by President Andrew Jackson. It is currently an American Legion hall. In 1875, the town built its second and current town hall on Central Street. The construction of the town hall put Saugus in a $50,000 debt. For this and other reasons the neighborhood of East Saugus sought to be set off from Saugus and annexed to the city of Lynn. East Saugus was unable to get a bill in both houses of the state legislature, and the issue was dropped after the town appropriated $5,000 for the laying of water pipes through East Saugus.\nPassenger trains ran through Saugus from 1853 to 1958 on the Saugus Branch Railroad. There were three Saugus Branch stations in Saugus (Saugus Center, Cliftondale, and Pleasant Hills) and two just outside the town's borders in Lynn (East Saugus) and Revere (Franklin Park).\nDuring the American Civil War, 155 Saugonians enlisted in the Union Army, and eight others enlisted in the Union Navy. Saugus native Gustavus Fox served as the United States Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the war. The USS Saugus, a Union Navy monitor named after the town, was launched in December 1863. Following the war Henry E. Hone donated a large granite monument to the town of Saugus. The monument, which was designed by Melzar Hunt Mosman and cost $10,000 to build, contains the names of all of the men from Saugus who served during the Civil War on bronze tablets. Above the tablets are two bronze statues, one of a soldier and one of a sailor. It is topped by a granite statue of woman wearing a helmet with an eagle on the top and holding a shield in her right hand, which serves as an allegorical representation of the United States. The monument was erected in the rotary at Saugus Center in 1875.\nFollowing the Civil War, the Cliftondale section of Saugus became a major producer of tobacco, as many of the southern tobacco plantations had been destroyed. Waitt & Bond became a major producer of cigars and the snuff factory in East Saugus was the nation's largest producer of that product.\nFrom 1859 to 1905, Saugus was home to the Franklin Park harness racing track. also known as the Old Saugus Race Track or Saugus Race Course. It closed in 1905 after local citizens complained about the questionable patrons that the racetrack attracted. In 1911 the racetrack became an airfield. In 1912, the property was purchased by the General Aviation Corporation who named it Atwood Park in honor of their most famous pilot, Harry Atwood. The airfield saw the first airmail delivery in New England on May 30, 1912. Pioneer aviators Ruth Bancroft Law and Lincoln J. Beachey flew at Saugus. The airport closed in the 1920s.\nOn October 8, 1900, George E. Bailey was murdered at Breakheart Hill Farm in Saugus. His legs and torso would be found nine days later in Floating Bridge Pond in Lynn. His head and arms were found there the next day. After a highly publicized investigation and trial, John C. Best was found guilty of murder. He was executed on September 9, 1902.\nIn 1934, Breakheart Hill Forest, a private hunting retreat located in North Saugus, was purchased by the Metropolitan District Commission for use as a state park. Shortly after purchasing Breakheart, the MDC turned the land over to the Civilian Conservation Corps, which built roads and trails, planted trees, and restored two dams on the property. In 1936, Breakheart Reservation was opened to the public.\nFollowing a June 2, 1947, referendum, the town adopted a Plan E form of government. Saugus became the first town in Massachusetts to accept this form of government. On February 16, 1948, James Shurtleff was unanimously chosen by the Board of Selectmen to become the first Town Manager of Saugus.\nIn 1948, archaeologist Roland W. Robbins began excavating the site of the Saugus Iron Works, which had become hidden by underbrush since its closure. Based on the archeological evidence gathered by Robbins as well as historical documents and conjecture, the First Iron Works Association, with funding from the American Iron and Steel Institute, reconstructed the Saugus Iron Works. The Saugus Iron Works was opened on September 18, 1954, and operated as a private museum from 1954 until April 5, 1968, when it was renamed the Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site and became part of the National Park Service system.\nSaugus is home to the oldest barber shop in the United States. The 112-year-old George's Barber Shop is located in the Cliftondale section of Saugus.\nIn the 1970s, the town, led by Town Manager Francis Moorehouse, attempted to transform the area around Route 107 by having an oil refinery and a garbage incineration plant built. Although the refinery plans fell through in October 1975, the incineration plant was completed. It would become the first commercially successful incineration plant in the U.S. and is still in operation today.\nIn 1989, the attempted murder of Frank Salemme (infamous criminal associate of Whitey Bulger and Stephen Flemmi) by Angelo Mercurio took place in Saugus.\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, the town's Capital Improvement Plan, designed by Edward J. Collins, Jr., resulted in the construction of the new public safety building, senior center, library and public works facility. The Saugus Town Hall and the Stackpole Field clubhouse were renovated. In 2001, Town Manager Steven Angelo was able to secure federal funds to dredge the Saugus River, a project that had lingered since the 1960s.\nThe Saugus American Little League team represented New England in the 2003 Little League World Series. The team finished the tournament in 4th place. Its come-from-behind victory over Richmond, Texas in the tournament's quarterfinals was nominated for the Best Game ESPY Award.\n## Geography and Transportation\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 11.8 square miles (30.6 km2), of which 10.8 square miles (28.0 km2) is land and 1.0 square mile (2.6 km2), or 8.53%, is water. The town lies just inland from Massachusetts Bay, divided from the ocean by the Point of Pines neighborhood of Revere. The southern end of town is dominated by Rumney Marsh, which lies along the Pines River, a tributary of the Saugus River. The Saugus River flows through town, and is fed by several brooks. There are several ponds within town, including parts of Birch Pond, Hawkes Pond and Walden Pond. Part of the Lynn Woods Reservation, and most of the Breakheart Reservation and Rumney Marsh Reservation lie within town.\nSaugus is divided into several neighborhood villages, including Saugus Center, East Saugus, North Saugus, Pleasant Hills, Lynnhurst, Oaklandvale, Hammersmith Village, Golden Hills, Blacksmith Village, Bristow and Cliftondale. Of these, the majority of the town's population resides in Lynnhurst, Pleasant Hills, Cliftondale, East Saugus and Saugus Center; Oaklandvale and North Saugus are much less densely populated. The town lies at the southern end of Essex County (though it is not the southernmost town in the county; Nahant extends just south of the town). The town is also bordered by Lynnfield to the north, Lynn to the east, Revere (in Suffolk County) to the south, and Melrose and Wakefield (both in Middlesex County) to the west. The town also shares a common point with the city of Malden, where it also meets Melrose and Revere. Saugus lies 8 miles (13 km) southwest of Salem, 9 miles (14 km) northeast of Boston, 24 miles (39 km) southwest of Cape Ann and 20 miles (32 km) south of the New Hampshire state line.\nU.S. Route 1 passes through town as a high-speed divided six-lane highway, with five exits throughout town. This stretch of Route 1, though not a full controlled access highway (it is lined with a major shopping district, including the Square One Mall), is the main commuter route out of Boston for the North Shore region, heading towards the interchange of Interstate 95 and Massachusetts Route 128 in Lynnfield, effectively serving as a practical extension of I-95 into Boston. Route 1 through Saugus was once known for its abundance of kitschy roadside commercial architecture, including the 68-foot neon cactus of the Hilltop Steak House, though since the 2000s some of these landmarks have been demolished or fallen into disrepair. The route is also shared by a 3/4-mile long concurrency with Route 129, which passes through North Saugus before joining Route 1 to head northward into Lynnfield. Route 99 terminates at Route 1 as well, in the southern end of town. Route 107 passes through the town as the Salem Turnpike through the Rumney Marsh, crossing the Saugus River into Lynn over the Fox Hill Bridge.\nThe Newburyport/Rockport Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail passes through the southeast corner of Saugus, but does not have a station in Saugus. The town is served by several MBTA bus routes. The nearest airport is Boston's Logan International Airport.\n## Demographics\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 26,628 people, 10,318 households, and 7,144 families residing in the town.

{"name": "Star Mosque", "documents": ["# Star Mosque\nStar Mosque (Bengali: তারা মসজিদ; also known as Tara Masjid), is a mosque located in Armanitola area, Dhaka, Bangladesh. The mosque has ornate designs and is decorated with motifs of blue stars. It was built in the first half of the 19th century by Mirza Golam Pir (Mirza Ahmed Jan).\n## Architecture\nBuilt in the Mughal style by Mirza Ghulam in the late 18th century, this mosque was originally a simple rectangular mosque, measuring 33' x 11' with three doorways on the east façade (main façade) and one on the north wall and another on the south wall. Three domes crowned the mosque, the central one being the larger. Towers accented the corners and the façades displayed plastered panel decoration. In early 20th century, Ali Jan Bepari financed its renovation when a front verandah was added. The surface was redone in 'Chini Tikri', a popular broken china decoration. The mosque is one of the very few examples of exclusive chinitikri mosaic, found in the striking blue star mosaic, which gave the mosque its name Star Mosque. In 1987, the prayer hall was extended by the Department of Architecture to include two more domes. It was decorated with imported china clay tiles and used both methods of applying chinitikri and used solid colour, cur clay tiles and formed patterns by placing the coloured tiles in white plaster. The domes and the exterior are covered with different coloured star shaped china clay tiles. The upper portion of the eastern façade also incorporates a crescent motif. The work assumed another texture by using assorted glazed tiles on the interior. The three mihrabs and the doorways are decorated with mosaic floral pattern. A plant and vase motif is repeated as a decorative element on the pendentive and the interior of the verandah wall.\n### Exterior decoration\nIn early 20th century, Ali Jan Bepari, a local businessman, financed the renovation of the mosque and added a new eastern verandah. The surface was redecorated with Chinitikri work (mosaic work of broken China porcelain pieces), a decorative style that was popular during the 1930s. The mosque, which previously lacked any historical significance, is one of the few remaining architectural example of the Chinitikri (Chinese pieces) method of mosaic decoration. This decorative technique is found in the striking star motif that is in part the reason for the mosque's current acclaim and popular name, Star Mosque or Sitara Masjid. In 1987, the Ministry of Religious Affairs commissioned Giasul Huque and Zahiruddin to make additions to the prayer hall, which was extended to include two more domes.\nThe mosque is decorated with Japanese and English china clay tiles and used both methods of the Chinitikri application. One approach uses solid colour, cut clay tiles and form patterns through the placement of these coloured tiles in white plaster. The domes and the exterior surface are covered with different coloured star shaped China clay tiles. The upper portion of the eastern façade also incorporates a crescent motif.\n### Interior decoration\nChinitikri tile work assumes another texture by using assorted pieces of different designs of glazed tiles on the interior surfaces of the mosque. The three mihrabs and the doorways are decorated with mosaic floral pattern. A plant and vase motif is repeated as a decorative element on the pendentives as well as on the interior of the verandah wall. As a decorative element, the Japanese Fujiyama motif, is found on the surface between the doors.\n## Archive Photos\nThe mosque as it was in 1967 Another 1967 image of the mosque Veranda of the mosque, 1967"], "selected_questions": ["What is the name of the mosque located in Armanitola area, Dhaka, Bangladesh?", "What is the reason for the mosque's popular name, Star Mosque?", "What materials were used to decorate the mosque's exterior?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The name of the mosque located in Armanitola area, Dhaka, Bangladesh is Star Mosque (Tara Masjid).", "The reason for the mosque's popular name, Star Mosque, is because it is decorated with motifs of blue stars, particularly on its domes and exterior surface.

{"name": "Politics of Berlin", "documents": ["# Politics of Berlin\nBerlin is a city-state and the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n## Capital city\nBerlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany. The President of Germany, whose functions are mainly ceremonial under the German constitution, has his official residence in Schloss Bellevue. Berlin is the seat of the German executive, housed in the Chancellery, the Bundeskanzleramt.\nFacing the Chancellery is the Bundestag, the German Parliament, housed in the renovated Reichstag building since the government moved back to Berlin in 1998. The Bundesrat (\"federal council\", functioning as an upper house) is the representation of the Federal States (Bundesländer) of Germany and has its seat at the former Prussian House of Lords.\n### Ministries\nThe relocation of the federal government and Bundestag to Berlin was completed in 1999, however with some ministries as well as some minor departments retained in the federal city Bonn, the former capital of West Germany. Discussions to move the remaining branches continue. The ministries and departments of Defence, Justice and Consumer Protection, Finance, Interior, Foreign, Economic Affairs and Energy, Labour and Social Affairs , Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety, Food and Agriculture, Economic Cooperation and Development, Health, Transport and Digital Infrastructure and Education and Research are based in the capital.\n## City-state\nSince German reunification on 3 October 1990, Berlin has been one of three city-states (with Hamburg and Bremen) among Germany's 16 states. The city and state parliament is the House of Representatives, (Abgeordnetenhaus), with 141 seats. Berlin's executive body is the Senate of Berlin (Senat von Berlin). The Senate consists of the Governing Mayor (Regierender Bürgermeister) and up to eight senators with ministerial positions (one holding the official title \"Mayor\" (Bürgermeister) as deputy to the Governing Mayor). The Social Democratic Party (SPD) and The Left (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the 2001 state election, winning another term in the 2006 state election. The 2011 state election produced a coalition of the Social Democratic Party and the Christian Democratic Union.\nThe Governing Mayor is Lord Mayor of the city (Oberbürgermeister der Stadt) and Prime Minister of the federal state (Ministerpräsident des Bundeslandes). The office of Berlin's Governing Mayor is in the Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall). From 2001 to 2014, this office was held by Klaus Wowereit of the SPD. It is currently held by Michael Müller, also of the SPD.\nThe total annual state budget of Berlin in 2007 exceeded €20.5 ($28.7) billion, which included a budget surplus of €80 ($112) million (the first surplus in the city-state's history). Due to increasing growth rates and tax revenues, the Senate of Berlin calculated an increasing budget surplus for 2008. The total budget was an estimated amount €5.5 ($7.7) billion, financed by the German government or the German Bundesländer. Primarily due to reunification-related expenditures, Berlin as a German state accumulated more debt than any other city in Germany (an estimated €60 ($84) billion in December 2007).\nThe city has ten state-level ministries (Senatsverwaltungen, Senate Departments), each led by a Senator, plus the Senate Chancellery, which is the office of the Governing Mayor. It also has seven state-level agencies (Landesämter), such as the Berlin Immigration Office.\n### Boroughs\nBerlin is divided into twelve boroughs (Bezirke), reduced from 23 boroughs before Berlin's 2001 administrative reform. Each borough has a number of localities (Ortsteile), which often have historic roots in older municipalities predating the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920 and were urbanised and incorporated into the city. Many residents strongly identify with their localities (or boroughs). Berlin has 96 localities, commonly made up of several city neighbourhoods (known as Kiez in the Berlin dialect).\nEach borough is governed by a council (Bezirksamt) with five councillors (Bezirksstadträte) and a borough mayor (Bezirksbürgermeister). The borough council is elected by the borough assembly (Bezirksverordnetenversammlung). The boroughs of Berlin are not independent municipalities; the borough governments' power is limited, and subordinate to the Berlin Senate. The borough mayors form a council of mayors (Rat der Bürgermeister, led by the city's governing mayor), which advises the Senate. The localities have no local government bodies, and the administrative duties of the former locality representative (the Ortsvorsteher) were assumed by the borough mayors.\n### Sister cities\nBerlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities. Town twinning between Berlin and other cities began with Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were cancelled at German reunification, but later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships were limited to the borough level. During the Cold War the partnerships reflected spheres of influence, with West Berlin partnering with Western capitals and East Berlin partnering primarily with cities of the Warsaw Pact and its allies.\nThere are joint projects with a number of other cities, such as Belgrade, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Johannesburg, Shanghai, Seoul, Sofia, Sydney and Vienna. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, Conference of the World's Capital Cities. Its sister cities are:\n## Security\n### Berlin Police\nThe Berlin Police (Der Polizeipräsident in Berlin' - The Police Chief of Berlin), or commonly Berliner Polizei is the German Landespolizei force for the city-state of Berlin. Law enforcement in Germany is divided between federal and state (Land) agencies. Berlin Police is divided into 6 local directorates (Direktion). Each local directorate is responsible for one to three Berliner districts:\nDirektion 1: Reinickendorf, Pankow Direktion 2: Spandau, Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf Direktion 3: Mitte Direktion 4: Tempelhof-Schöneberg, Steglitz-Zehlendorf Direktion 5: Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, Neukölln Direktion 6: Marzahn-Hellersdorf, Treptow-Köpenick, Lichtenberg\n### Federal Police\nThe Federal Police (Bundespolizei or BPOL) is a (primarily) uniformed federal police force in Berlin and Germany. It is subordinate to the Federal Ministry of the Interior (Bundesministerium des Innern (BMI)).\nThe Bundespolizei can also be used to reinforce state police if requested by a state (Land) government. The BPOL maintains these reserve forces to deal with major demonstrations, disturbances or emergencies, supplementing the capabilities of the State Operational Support Units. Several highly trained detachments are available for crisis situations requiring armored cars, water cannon or other special equipment.\nBPOL has investigators conduct criminal investigations only within its jurisdiction; otherwise the cases are referred to the appropriate state police force or to the federal criminal investigative agency, the Federal Criminal Police (Bundeskriminalamt, BKA). In addition, the Bundespolizei cooperates closely with German state executive authorities, such as prosecutor's offices (Staatsanwaltschaft) in pursuing criminal investigations.\nThe Bundespolizei has the following missions:\nBorder security (Grenzpolizei or Grepo), to include passport control Protection of federal buildings such as Schloss Bellevue, the residence of the German Bundespräsident. Providing the federal government's mobile response force for internal security events. Providing transportation security at international airports and on the German railways. Providing counter-terrorism forces (GSG 9). Providing air (or sky) marshals. Supporting international police missions for the United Nations and the EU Providing in-house security for some German embassies.

The motte and the bailey (courtyard) are contained within a wide ditch, 132 m by 122 m across. The entrance to the castle was on the south side.\nThe castle is thought to have been at its greatest importance during the civil wars that arose after Stephen of Blois (1097-1154) took the throne instead of Matilda, Henry I's daughter. Later, Stephen adopted Matilda's son, Henry, as his heir but it was Stephen's death in 1154 that brought about the demise of Desning Castle. The newly crowned Henry II decided to strip many of the leading Suffolk nobles of their castles as a result of their support for Stephen. As a result it is thought that Desning Castle was slighted, retaining the hall and other buildings within the bailey.

The rails and crossties of the track were removed before 1920.\nWhat were then called the 1st and 3rd Regiments of the Louisiana Native Guards (later re-formed as regiments of the United States Colored Troops) proved themselves in battle on the Union side; they were the first black troops to have some black officers. A minority of men in the regiments were free men of color, who had been educated before the war; most of the soldiers were African-American slaves who had escaped to Union lines to gain freedom and support the war.\nPort Hudson National Cemetery was established in the area, first as a place of burial of Union dead.\n## Landmarks\nA portion of the battlefield site is maintained by the state as a park and museum, called the Port Hudson State Historic Site (in adjacent East Feliciana Parish).\nIn 1930 the Louisiana Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy erected the Confederate Soldiers monument at the site; it is an 11,000-pound obelisk, dedicated to the defenders' memory. In 2007 the monument was moved to the yard of one of Port Hudson's few surviving buildings from the time of the siege.\nIn 1974 the Port Hudson National Cemetery was designated a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior; it is administered by the National Park Service.\nIn 2009, it was designated among the first 26 featured sites of the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail.\n## Representation in culture\n\"The Black Brigade at Port Hudson\" is a poem by John A.

{"name": "Polish occupation zone in Germany", "documents": ["# Polish occupation zone in Germany\nThe Polish occupation zone in Germany was a military occupation area, under the administration of the Polish government-in-exile, located within the British Occupation Zone of the Allied-occupied Germany, that existed from 19 May 1945 to 10 September 1948. It was established from the territory of the British-controlled occupied Nazi Germany, following its surrender ending the World War II, and existed until 10 September 1948, when the administration of the area was given back to the United Kingdom. The zone was created for the Polish displaced people, consisting of those freed from German labour camps, and concentration camps, and the prisoners of war. In 1945, it was inhabited by over 30,000 Polish civilians and around 18,000 soldiers, and had an area of 6,470 km2, being located within the area of modern districts of County of Bentheim, Cloppenburg, Emsland, and Osnabrück, within Lower Saxony, Germany. Its seat was located in the town of Haren, then renamed to Maczków.\n## History\nAt the end of World War II there were over 3 million Polish citizens in Germany, most of them displaced persons (DPs) who got there either as slave labourers, prisoners of German concentration camps or prisoners of war. As the political situation in Communist-controlled Poland was uncertain, the Allied authorities decided to create a Polish enclave in Germany that would serve both as a resettlement camp, local cultural centre and a station from which the DPs could further be dispatched to Poland or various western states. As Haren lay in the occupation zone administered by the Polish I Corps (and more specifically the Polish 1st Armoured Division), it was chosen as the most appropriate centre of a Polish enclave in Germany.\nOn 19 May 1945, the Polish 1st Armoured Division, a unit attached to the British Army moved all of the thousand families of Haren out to surrounding communities. Over 4000 Poles from Labor camps and prisoner-of-war camps in Northern Germany moved into the town. Many of them had been members of the Polish Home Army, men and women, who had fought in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.\nInitially, the new Polish enclave was named Lwów, after the city in South-Eastern Poland by then occupied and later annexed by the Soviet Union. However, under Soviet pressure the name was then changed to Maczków, in honour of General Stanislaw Maczek, the commanding officer of the Armoured Division and the local Allied occupation forces. The streets in the town were renamed to Polish, either honouring various military units (Legionów Str., Artyleryjska Str.) or named after streets in Warsaw (Ujazdowskie Avenue).\nDuring the next months, a Polish town with a Polish mayor, a Polish school, a folk high school, a Polish fire brigade and a Polish rectory were established. The latter registered 289 weddings and 101 funerals. 479 Poles have birth certificates showing Maczków as a place of birth. As there were hundreds of thousands of Poles in the area administered by the 1st Armoured Division, \"Maczków\" also served as a cultural centre: newspapers were being published there on a daily basis (Dziennik and Defilada eventually reaching 90 thousand copies), a theatre was opened (led by Leon Schiller) and concert halls were active. Among the most notable events held in the Polish enclave was a 1947 concert by Benjamin Britten and Lord Yehudi Menuhin.\nIn the Autumn of 1946, the Polish forces stationed in North-Western Germany started to be demobilised and ferried back to the United Kingdom. Also, the civilian inhabitants started to return to Poland or move to other European states.

{"name": "Moravian Serbia", "documents": ["# Moravian Serbia\nMoravian Serbia (Serbian: Моравска Србија, romanized: Moravska Srbija), the Principality of Moravian Serbia (Serbian: Кнежевина Моравска Србија, romanized: Kneževina Moravska Srbija) or the Realm of Prince Lazar are the names used in historiography for the largest and most powerful Serbian principality to emerge from the ruins of the Serbian Empire (1371). Moravian Serbia was named after Morava, the main river of the region. The independent principality in the region of Morava was established in 1371, and attained its largest extent in 1379 through the military and political activities of its first ruler, prince Lazar Hrebeljanović. In 1402 it was raised to the Serbian Despotate, which would exist until 1459.\n## History\nLazar Hrebeljanović was born in around 1329 in the fortress of Prilepac, near the town of Novo Brdo in the region of Kosovo, Kingdom of Serbia. Lazar was a courtier at the court of Serbian Tsar Stefan Uroš Dušan, and at the court of Dušan's successor, Tsar Stefan Uroš V (r. 1356–1371). Uroš's reign was characterized by the weakening of the central authority and the gradual disintegration of the Serbian Empire. Powerful Serbian nobles became practically independent in the regions they controlled.\nLazar left the court of Tsar Uroš in 1363 or 1365, and became a regional lord. He held the title of prince since at least 1371. His territory initially developed in the shadow of stronger regional lords. The strongest were the Mrnjavčević brothers, Vukašin and Jovan Uglješa. They were defeated and killed by the Ottoman Turks in the Battle of Maritsa in 1371, after which Lazar took a part of their territory. Lazar and Tvrtko I, the Ban of Bosnia, jointly defeated in 1373 another strong noble, Nikola Altomanović. Most of Altomanović's territory was acquired by Lazar. About that time, Lazar accepted the suzerainty of King Louis I of Hungary, who granted him the region of Mačva, or at least a part of it. With all these territorial gains, Lazar emerged as the most powerful Serbian lord. The state he then created is known in historiography as the Principality of \"Moravian Serbia\".\nMoravian Serbia attained its full extent in 1379, when Lazar took Braničevo and Kučevo, ousting the Hungarian vassal Radič Branković Rastislalić from these regions. Lazar's state was larger than the domains of the other lords on the territory of the former Serbian Empire. It also had a better organized government and army. The state comprised the basins of the Great Morava, West Morava, and South Morava Rivers, extending from the source of South Morava northward to the Danube and Sava Rivers. Its north-western border ran along the Drina River. Besides the capital Kruševac, the state included important towns of Niš and Užice, as well as Novo Brdo and Rudnik, two richest mining centres of medieval Serbia. Of all the Serbian lands, Lazar's state lay furthest from Ottoman centres, and was least exposed to the ravages of Turkish raiding parties. This circumstance attracted immigrants from Turkish-threatened areas, who built new villages and hamlets in previously poorly inhabited and uncultivated areas of Moravian Serbia. There were also spiritual persons among the immigrants, which stimulated the revival of old ecclesiastical centres and the foundation of new ones in Lazar's state.\nA Turkish raiding party, passing unobstructed through territories of Ottoman vassals, broke into Moravian Serbia in 1381. It was routed by Lazar's nobles Crep Vukoslavić and Vitomir in the Battle of Dubravica, fought near the town of Paraćin. In 1386, the Ottoman Sultan Murad I himself led much larger forces that took Niš from Lazar. It is unclear whether the encounter between the armies of Lazar and Murad at Pločnik, a site southwest of Niš, happened shortly before or after the capture of Niš. Lazar rebuffed Murad at Pločnik.\nAfter the death of King Louis in 1382, a civil war broke out in the Kingdom of Hungary. Lazar briefly participated in the war as one of the opponents of Prince Sigismund of Luxemburg, and he sent some troops to fight in the regions of Belgrade and Syrmia. These fights ended with no territorial gains for Lazar, who made peace with Sigismund in 1387.\nIn the Battle of Kosovo fought on 15 June 1389, Lazar led the army which confronted a massive invading army of the Ottoman Empire commanded by Sultan Murad I. Both Prince Lazar and Sultan Murad lost their lives in the battle. Although the battle was tactically a draw, the mutual heavy losses were devastating only for the Serbs. Lazar was succeeded by his eldest son Stefan Lazarević. As he was still a minor, Moravian Serbia was administered by Lazar's widow, Milica. She was attacked from north, five months after the battle, by troops of the Hungarian King Sigismund. When Turkish forces, moving toward Hungary, reached the borders of Moravian Serbia in the summer of 1390, Milica accepted Ottoman suzerainty.\nStefan Lazarević participated as an Ottoman vassal in the Battle of Karanovasa in 1394, the Battle of Rovine in 1395, the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, and in the Battle of Angora in 1402. After Angora, he visited Constantinople, the capital city of the Byzantine Empire, where he was given the title of Despot, and since then his state became known as the Serbian Despotate in 1402.\n## Rulers\nLazar Hrebeljanović (1371–1389) Stefan Lazarević (1389–1402)"], "selected_questions": ["What were the names used in historiography for the largest and most powerful Serbian principality to emerge from the ruins of the Serbian Empire?", "In what year did Moravian Serbia attain its full extent?", "In what year did Stefan Lazarević's state become known as the Serbian Despotate?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The names used in historiography for the largest and most powerful Serbian principality to emerge from the ruins of the Serbian Empire are Moravian Serbia, the Principality of Moravian Serbia, and the Realm of Prince Lazar.", "Moravian Serbia attained its full extent in the year 1379.", "Stefan Lazarević's state became known as the Serbian Despotate in 1402."], "InternLM_answers": ["The names used in historiography for the largest and most powerful Serbian principality to emerge from the ruins of the Serbian Empire were Serbian Despotate, Serbian Empire, and Serbian Despotate of the Branković dynasty.", "Moravian Serbia attained its full extent in 1371.", "1402"], "human_GPT3.5_answers_D_ann": [["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> Moravian Serbia (Serbian: Моравска Србија, romanized: Moravska Srbija), the Principality of Moravian Serbia (Serbian: Кнежевина Моравска Србија, romanized: Kneževina Moravska Srbija) or the Realm of Prince Lazar are the names used in historiography for the largest and most powerful Serbian principality to emerge from the ruins of the Serbian Empire (1371)"], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> Moravian Serbia attained its full extent in 1379, when Lazar took Braničevo and Kučevo"], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> After Angora, he visited Constantinople, the capital city of the Byzantine Empire, where he was given the title of Despot, and since then his state became known as the Serbian Despotate in 1402"]], "human_InternLM_answers_ann": [["<Hallucination> Contradictory\n<Reference> Moravian Serbia was named after Morava, the main river of the region<SEP> In 1402 it was raised to the Serbian Despotate, which would exist until 1459 参考0：Moravian Serbia (Serbian: Моравска Србија, romanized: Moravska Srbija), the Principality of Moravian Serbia (Serbian: Кнежевина Моравска Србија, romanized: Kneževina Moravska Srbija) or the Realm of Prince Lazar are the names used in historiography for the largest and most powerful Serbian principality to emerge from the ruins of the Serbian Empire (1371).\n<Correction>  \"Serbian Despotate, Serbian Empire, and Serbian Despotate of the Branković dynasty\" to \"Moravian Serbia, the Principality of Moravian Serbia, and the Realm of Prince Lazar\"."], ["<Hallucination> Contradictory\n<Reference> The independent principality in the region of Morava was established in 1371, and attained its largest extent in 1379\n<Correction>  \"1371\" to \"1379\"."], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> After Angora, he visited Constantinople, the capital city of the Byzantine Empire, where he was given the title of Despot, and since then his state became known as the Serbian Despotate in 1402"]], "language": "en"}
{"name": "Diyar Bakr", "documents": ["# Diyar Bakr\nDiyar Bakr (Arabic: دِيَارُ بَكرٍ, romanized: Diyār Bakr, lit. 'abode of Bakr') is the medieval Arabic name of the northernmost of the three provinces of the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), the other two being Diyar Mudar and Diyar Rabi'a. According to the medieval geographer al-Baladhuri, all three provinces were named after the main Arab tribes that were settled there by Mu'awiyah in the course of the Muslim conquests of the 7th century. The Diyar Bakr was settled by the Rabi'a subgroup of the Banu Bakr, and hence the two provinces are sometimes referred to collectively as \"Diyar Rabi'a\". In later Turkish usage, \"Diyar Bakr\" referred to the western portion of the former province, around Amid (which hence became known as Diyarbakır in Turkish).\nDiyar Bakr encompasses the region on both banks of the upper course of the river Tigris, from its sources to approximately where its course changes from a west-east to a southeasterly direction. Its main city was Amida (Amid in Arabic), and other major settlements included Mayyafariqin, Hisn Kaifa, and Arzan. Geographically and politically, in early Islamic times the Diyar Bakr was usually part of the Jazira, but it was sometimes joined to the Armenian province to the north. In the late 9th century, it was controlled by an autonomous dynasty founded by Isa ibn al-Shaykh al-Shaybani. In the mid-10th century, the region passed into the hands of the Hamdanids, but their rule was contested by the Buyids (978–983) and after that the Marwanids.\nThe Marwanid emirate ruled the region for almost a century before being annexed by the Seljuk Empire in 1084–1085. Following the Seljuk realm's collapse after the death of Malik-Shah I in 1092, a series of small emirates established itself across the region, with the Artuqids of Mardin the most important among them. In the late 12th century, the province came under Ayyubid control, and in the mid-13th century it was divided between the Ayyubids in the east and the Seljuks of Rum, who controlled the western portion around Amida. Around 1260, the region was conquered by the Mongols, who allowed the local rulers to continue to exercise power as their vassals. In the 14th century, the region was conquered by the Aq Qoyunlu, who disputed control with the Qara Qoyunlu and the last Ayyubid princes.

{"name": "Klemzig, South Australia", "documents": ["# Klemzig, South Australia\nKlemzig is a suburb of Adelaide in the City of Port Adelaide Enfield. It was the first settlement of German immigrants in Australia and was named after the village of Klemzig in what was then German Prussia and is now Klępsk in western Poland.\n## Background\nThe initial establishment of Klemzig as an Old Lutheran settlement in the South Australian Colony is attributed to a decision by Pastor August Ludwig Christian Kavel. Pastor Kavel was determined to help his loyal parishioners emigrate from Brandenburg, Posen and Silesia to escape religious persecution by King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia.\nPastor Kavel initially planned to move his parishioners to Russia near the Black Sea, where there were already numerous German settlements, but that had proved not to be feasible. Early in 1836, Kavel travelled to Hamburg to investigate possible emigration to America, but lack of available financial assistance caused this plan to collapse.\nWhile in Hamburg, Kavel heard of the wealthy philanthropist, George Fife Angas, who was Chairman of the South Australian Company and likely to assist the Old Lutherans with their migration plans.\nKavel and a representative of his congregation travelled to London in March 1836 and met a very sympathetic George Fife Angas. Angas was a Baptist and was convinced that the Old Lutherans, who placed such high value on their religious beliefs, would make excellent settlers in the South Australian Colony.\nAngas persuaded the Directors of the South Australian Company to support him in chartering and fitting out the barque Sarah which was to proceed to Hamburg. Here, 370 Old Lutherans were to set sail for South Australia on 8 June 1836. However, Prussian authorities refused to grant the necessary passports until finally, after a distressing delay of nearly two years, the Prussian Government relented. Over the next six years, many ships brought Kavel's Old Lutheran parishioners to the South Australian Colony.\n### Ships\nSome of the emigrant ships included:\nThe barque Bengalee departed Hamburg on 16 July 1838 and after a seven-day stop off at Kingscote (Kangaroo Island) arrived in Port Adelaide on 16 November 1838. On board were 33 passengers. The passenger ship The Prince George departed Hamburg on 13 July 1838 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 18 November 1838. On board were 207 passengers including Pastor Kavel. The passenger ship Zebra departed Altona on 28 August 1838 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 27 December 1838. On board were 191 passengers. A listing of the ship's cargo log also reveals that on board were 40,924 bricks presumably for the establishment of new dwellings. The barque Cathrina departed Hamburg on 15 September 1838 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 20 January 1839. On board were 122 passengers. The passenger ship Skjold departed Altona on 3 July 1841 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 27 October 1841. On board were 241 passengers. Official records show that the three-month journey claimed the lives of 41 people. The passenger ship Taglione departed London on 20 June 1842 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 13 October 1842. An unknown number of passengers were on board. The passenger ship George Washington departed Hamburg on 23 May 1844 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 12 September 1844. On board were 184 passengers. The schooner Joseph Albino departed London on 4 July 1845 and arrived in Port Adelaide on 8 December 1845. On board were 7 passengers.\n## Settlement\nIn March 1837 Colonel William Light completed surveying Kangaroo Island, Encounter Bay, Port Lincoln and the Adelaide Plains. Light eventually chose the Adelaide Plains as the most suitable location for the capital.\nThe first groups of Old Lutheran emigrants arrived in Port Misery between October 1838 and January 1839. With the assistance of George Fife Angas, many attempted to integrate into the local community by becoming tradespeople and labourers. Due to the scarcity of work, the lack of English as their preferred language, and the prejudice from the already established British farmers, many Old Lutherans found settlement increasingly hard.\nIn 1838, Klemzig was founded by these emigrants after George Fife Angas offered a section of land bordering the Torrens River, a few kilometres to the north-east of Adelaide.\n## Renaming\nDue to anti-German sentiment during World War I, the name of Klemzig was changed, as were many other German place names in Australia at the time. In 1917 Klemzig was renamed Gaza, commemorating the British victory in the Third Battle of Gaza, in which Australian troops had a major role. Klemzig was re-instated as the suburb name with the enactment of the South Australia Nomenclature Act of 1935 on 12 December 1935, but remnants of the name Gaza still exist with the local football club still bearing the name. During World War II, the residents of Klemzig petitioned the Government of South Australia on a number of occasions to have the name Gaza re-instated but these requests were denied.\n## Transport\nKlemzig is currently serviced by several bus routes, including 271 and 273 along North East Road and 281 on McLauchlan Road, and the suburb is also served by Klemzig Interchange of the O-Bahn Busway.\nTorrens Linear Park borders the O-Bahn and River Torrens to the south of the suburb and there is easy access to the CBD as well as neighbouring suburbs."], "selected_questions": ["Who was Pastor August Ludwig Christian Kavel and what role did he play in the establishment of Klemzig, South Australia?", "When and why was Klemzig founded, and where is it located in relation to Adelaide?", "Why was the name of Klemzig changed during World War I, what was it changed to, and when was the original name reinstated?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Pastor August Ludwig Christian Kavel was an important figure in the establishment of Klemzig, South Australia.

{"name": "Fort Ord", "documents": ["# Fort Ord\nFort Ord is a former United States Army post on Monterey Bay of the Pacific Ocean coast in California, which closed in 1994 due to Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action. Most of the fort's land now makes up the Fort Ord National Monument, managed by the United States Bureau of Land Management as part of the National Conservation Lands, while a small portion remains an active military installation under Army control designated as the Ord Military Community.\nBefore construction and official designation as a fort in 1940, the land was used as a maneuver area and field-artillery target range during 1917. Fort Ord was considered one of the most attractive locations of any U.S. Army post, because of its proximity to the beach and California weather. The 7th Infantry Division was its main garrison for many years. When Fort Ord was converted to civilian use, space was set aside for the first nature reserve in the United States created for conservation of an insect, the endangered Smith's blue butterfly. Additional endangered species are found on Fort Ord, including Contra Costa goldfields and the threatened California tiger salamander.\nWhile much of the old military buildings and infrastructure remain abandoned, many structures have been torn down for anticipated development. California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB) and the Fort Ord Dunes State Park, along with some subdivisions, the Veterans Transition Center, a commercial strip mall, a tandem skydiving drop zone, military facilities and a nature preserve occupy the area today.\nOn April 20, 2012, President Barack Obama signed a proclamation designating a 14,651-acre (5,929 ha) portion of the former post as the Fort Ord National Monument. In his proclamation, the President stated that, \"The protection of the Fort Ord area will maintain its historical and cultural significance, attract tourists and recreationalists from near and far, and enhance its unique natural resources, for the enjoyment of all Americans.\"\n## History\nAfter the American entry into World War I, land was purchased just north of the city of Monterey along Monterey Bay for use as an artillery training field for the United States Army by the U.S. Department of War. The area was known as the Gigling Reservation, U.S. Field Artillery Area, Presidio of Monterey and Gigling Field Artillery Range. Although military development and construction was just beginning, the war only lasted for another year and a half until the armistice in November 11, 1918.\nDespite a great demobilization of the U.S. Armed Forces during the inter-war years of the 1920s and 1930s, by 1933, the artillery field became Camp Ord, named in honor of Union Army Maj. Gen. Edward Otho Cresap Ord, (1818–1883). Primarily, horse cavalry units trained on the camp until the military began to mechanize and train mobile combat units such as tanks, armored personnel carriers and movable artillery.\nBy 1940, the 23-year-old Camp Ord was expanded to 2,000 acres (810 ha), with the realization that the two-year-old conflict of World War II could soon cross the Atlantic Ocean to involve America. In August 1940, it was re-designated Fort Ord and the 7th Infantry Division was reactivated, becoming the first major unit to occupy the post. Sub camps were built around the Fort to support the new training of Troops, Camp Clayton. Camp Clayton was built near CA Highway 1, the South Dakota National Guard 147th Artillery were the first unit to train at the new camp.\nIn 1941, Camp Ord became Fort Ord. But soon the first threat came from the west as the Imperial Japanese Navy struck the island of Oahu, Hawaii at Pearl Harbor near Honolulu in an unannounced air attack, Sunday, December 7, 1941. In a few days the other Axis powers, such as Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany, along with Fascist Italy of Benito Mussolini, declared and spread their war in Europe against Great Britain and France and the Low Countries to the U.S.\nThe end of the war came with the surrenders of Germany, in May, and Japan, in September 1945. The soon onset of a Cold War against the Soviet Union caused tensions continued for the next forty some years into the early 1990s. In 1947, Fort Ord became the home of the 4th Replacement Training Center. During the 1950s and 1960s, Fort Ord was a staging area for units departing for war in the Korean War and later peacetime/occupation duty in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines and Thailand. Then, when Southeast Asia became a war zone with Vietnam (and later involving, by the 1970s, Cambodia and Laos), the United States had, at one time, 50,000 troops on the installation. The 194th Armored Brigade was activated there under Combat Development Command in 1957, but departed for Fort Knox in Kentucky in 1960.\nBetween 1952 and 1954 the Del E. Webb Construction Company was hired to construct some 42 new permanent buildings to make Fort Ord a permanent Army post. The total cost of construction was more than $20,000,000. The first buildings completed were dormitories followed by a guard house and stockade. Additional buildings constructed as part of the plan were an administrative headquarters building, quartermaster warehouses, and an improved water storage system. There were a total of 31 dormitory buildings that could house 7,000 men.\nIn 1957, land on the eastern side of the post was used to create the Laguna Seca Raceway which served to replace the Pebble Beach road racing course that ceased operations for safety reasons in that same year.\nThe post continued as a center for instruction of basic and advanced infantrymen until 1976, when the training area was deactivated and Fort Ord again became the home of the 7th Infantry Division, following their return from South Korea after twenty-five years on the DMZ (\"demilitarized zone\").\nOn July 14, 1989, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed placement of Fort Ord on the National Priorities List (NPL). The site contained leaking underground petroleum storage tanks, a 150-acre (61 ha) landfill that was primarily used to dispose of residential waste and small amounts of commercial waste generated by the base, a former fire drill area, motor pool maintenance areas, small dump sites, small arms target ranges, an 8,000-acre (3,200 ha) firing range, and other limited areas that posed threats from unexploded ordnance. NPL status was finalized on February 21, 1990.\nThe final basic training classes were held in 1976.\n## Closing the Fort, 1994\nThe Base Realignment and Closure Commission of 1991 recommended closing the post and moving the units stationed at Fort Ord to Fort Lewis, Washington. On May 2, 1992, Army elements from Fort Ord along with Marines from Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton participated in quelling the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In 1994, Fort Ord was finally closed. Most of the land was returned to the State of California for further public use and became the home of CSUMB. The remainder was given to University of California, Santa Cruz to be developed into the \"UC MBEST\" (Monterey Bay Education, Science and Technology) Center. The MBEST Center is a regional economic development effort focused on developing collaborative research-business opportunities in the Monterey Bay region.\n## Fort Ord Reuse Authority (FORA)\nThe Fort Ord Reuse Authority (FORA) is responsible for the oversight of Monterey Bay area economic recovery from the closure of and reuse planning of the former Fort Ord. The military base was located on the California coastline near the Monterey Peninsula, consisting of 28,000 acres (44 sq mi; 11,000 ha) of land. FORA implements this legislatively mandated mission by overseeing replacement land use; assuring compliance with adopted measures; removing physical barriers to reuse; financing and constructing major components of the required infrastructure and basewide demands; and protecting identified environmental reserves. FORA exercises its planning, financing, and monitoring responsibilities under state law authority to meet these objectives in the best interest of the northern Monterey Bay community.\nFORA is small multi-governmental body, composed of elected officials at the local, state, and federal levels, as well as representatives from the United States Armed Forces and educational bodies such as CSUMB at the primary, secondary, and university levels. Voting members are made up of representatives from the cities of Carmel-by-the-Sea, Del Rey Oaks, Marina, Sand City, Monterey, Pacific Grove, Salinas, and Seaside as well as two representatives from the County of Monterey Ex-officio members are composed of representatives from the Monterey Peninsula Community College District, the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District, California's 17th congressional district, California's 15th State Senate district, California's 27th State Assembly district, the United States Army, the Chancellor of the California State University, the President of the University of California, the Monterey County Water Resources Agency, and the Transportation Agency of Monterey County.\nThis legislatively mandated mission is directed by FORA's 1997 Fort Ord Base Reuse Plan (Reuse Plan). In 2012, FORA performed a comprehensive Reuse Plan Reassessment to assess remaining work.\n## Ongoing environmental cleanup efforts\n### The Army's Fort Ord cleanup project\nThe Army's environmental cleanup of the former Fort Ord has been underway since the base was closed and is separated into two programs — the Soil and Groundwater Contamination Cleanup Program, and the Munitions and Explosives of Concern (MEC) Program. A Federal Facility Agreement was signed by the Army, EPA, California Department of Toxic Substances Control and the California Regional Water Quality Control Board Central Coast Region in 1990. Additionally, the Army provides oversight on FORA's cleanup program, called the Environmental Services Cooperative Agreement (see below).\n### FORA's privatized cleanup project\nIn May 2007, the Fort Ord Reuse Authority voluntarily entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with EPA and the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) for the cleanup of 3,484 acres (1,410 ha) of Fort Ord land. The Army and EPA provide the necessary oversight on the project, referred to as FORA's Environmental Services Cooperative Agreement (ESCA). Under this privatized cleanup scheme, FORA received these properties through early transfer and is responsible for the cleanup of these specific areas of Fort Ord. The Administrative Order on Consent requires FORA to clean up the parcels to an extent that would protect human health and environment.\n## Present-day Fort Ord\nFort Ord's former military golf courses, Bayonet and Black Horse, are, as of January 16, 1997, public golf courses. They have hosted PGA golf events and were recently renovated.\n### California State University, Monterey Bay\nCalifornia State University, Monterey Bay opened on the Fort's former ground shortly after Fort Ord's closing in 1994 as part of 42nd President Bill Clinton's \"peace dividends\" program. The University has currently enrolled more than 7,500 students. The Leon Panetta Institute (named for the former U.S. Representative and Secretary of Defense) is located on its campus. Schoonover, Frederick and Frederick II are housing developments located in the former Fort Ord created for students and families who are associated with CSUMB, Monterey Peninsula Unified School District and local school districts. All three parks are accessible off of Abrams Drive.\n### Veterans Transition Center\nThe Veterans Transition Center (VTC) is located on the site of the former Fort Ord. Since its inception it has served 4,155 single veterans and 351 veterans with families. As of 2009 the center is looking to expand by adding more housing units and a non-profit store (to be run by partner company, Vocational Rehabilitation Specialists Inc.) with the express purpose of employing as many veterans as possible.\n### Fort Ord Dunes State Park and National Monument\nIn 2009, a coastal strip overlooking Monterey Bay became California's newest state park, Fort Ord Dunes State Park. At the end of Gigling Road, where the DOD Building is located, is one of many entrances to the Fort Ord National Monument; the land underwent comprehensive remediation that involved an extensive munitions clean-up. There are more than 91 miles (146 km) of recreational trails available. They are used by the trail communities on foot, on bicycles, and on horseback. All open trails are available to all non-motorized trail user groups. A small number of trails are fenced along their edges because of possible unexploded ordnance.\nOn January 13, 2012, United States Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar visited Fort Ord, addressed a crowd of 200 supporters and announced that he was proposing to President Obama that Fort Ord be elevated to national monument status. On April 20, 2012, Barack Obama signed a Presidential Proclamation establishing Fort Ord National Monument.\nFort Ord National Monument refers to that land on the former Fort Ord that is administered by the Bureau of Land Management and is open to the general public. The BLM currently manages 7,200 acres and will manage 14,650 acres after the U.S. Army finishes environmental restoration on the remaining parcel.\nAs of May 2018, Fort Ord National Monument has extended its trail system to add bypass and spur trails to popular areas.\n### Remaining military presence\nA small portion of the former Fort Ord still remains under U.S. Army control, originally called the Presidio of Monterey (POM) Annex. It is now called the Ord Military Community (described below).\nThe military is still present at Fort Ord, in the form of several California Army National Guard units, facilities administered by the Presidio of Monterey, the Defense Manpower Data Center, and the continued operation of the base Army and Air Force Exchange Service PX and a Commissary catering to the active duty military stationed in the Monterey area as well as reservists, national guardsmen, and military retirees who chose to settle in the area and are entitled to shop at such facilities. Management of the military housing has been outsourced to private firms, but the homes are still occupied by personnel stationed at the Presidio of Monterey, the Naval Postgraduate School and retired military members.\n## Development\nThe nearby city of Marina is developing a large parcel of land from the former Fort Ord within its city limits, building more than 1,000 new homes. A large commercial strip mall along Highway 1 at the former 12th Street Gate entrance to Fort Ord opened in late 2007, and houses popular retail stores. The City of Marina is planning a 13-mile recreation trail to run through Fort Ord to the Fort Ord National Monument, the Salinas River, and through Fort Ord Dunes State Park.\nAs of December 2014, some of the land for a proposed development project (Monterey Downs) will not be officially clear of unexploded ordnance until at least late 2017.\n### List of development projects\nCity of Marina University Villages/Dunes on Monterey Bay Sea Haven Imjin Office Park Cypress Knolls (senior-oriented residential community) City of Seaside Seaside Resort Main Gate Retail Center Central Coast Veterans Cemetery City of Del Rey Oaks Del Rey Oaks Resort (currently on hold) County of Monterey East Garrison\n## Miscellaneous\n### World War II Warhorse Hospital\nThe Fort Ord Station Veterinary Hospital at the Marina Equestrian Center Park in Marina was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014, by the Friends of the Fort Ord Warhorse. This is the first such designation on Fort Ord. The history is detailed at. The Fort Ord SVH was built for the Army Veterinary Corps as an equine veterinary hospital in 1941 to serve the 1400 horses of the 76th Field Artillery Regiment, cavalry, and quartermaster mule-train units. This is the only remaining example of a major World War II-construction medical facility for warhorses. Twelve of the original twenty-one World War II stables for the horses and mules were about 200 yards away, on Fourth Avenue and Gen Jim Moore Boulevard, but were demolished by CSUMB in 2011.\n### Stilwell Hall\nStilwell Hall was an immense, 52,000-square-foot (4,800 m2) building that stood on a precipice at the edge of the Pacific across from the former Fort Ord military installation.\nThe building was constructed between November 1940 and September 1943 under the initiative of General Joseph W. Stilwell. It served as a recreational facility for military members for just over fifty years before Fort Ord was closed in 1994. Abandoned, Stilwell Hall fell into disrepair and was torn down in 2003 after severe coastal erosion threatened to cause the structure, filled with asbestos and lead-paint, to collapse into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.\n## Notable people\nNick Bacon, (Basic Training 1963) Medal of Honor recipient for actions in the Vietnam War.

{"name": "Catalan counties", "documents": ["# Catalan counties\nThe Catalan counties (Catalan: Comtats Catalans, IPA: ) were the administrative Christian divisions of the eastern Carolingian Hispanic Marches and the southernmost part of the March of Gothia in the Pyrenees created after their rapid conquest by the Franks.\nThe various counties roughly defined what later came to be known as the Principality of Catalonia.\nIn 778, Charlemagne led the first military Frankish expedition into Hispania to create the Hispanic Marches, a buffer zone between the Umayyad Moors and Arabs of Al-Andalus and the Frankish Kingdom of Aquitaine. The territory that he subdued was the kernel of Catalonia (not yet known like that since the first written mention of Catalonia and the Catalans as an ethnicity appears almost a century later in 1113 at the Liber maiolichinus) which was already a no man's land since the defeat of the Visigoths and the arrival of the Muslims in 714 who crossed the Pyrenees with an army to be defeated in 732 at the Battle of Tours. In 781, Charlemagne made his 3-year-old son Louis the Pious (778 – 840) king of Aquitaine, who was sent there with regents and a court in order to secure the southern border of his kingdom against the Arabs and the moors and to expand southwards into Muslim territory.\nThese counties were originally feudal entities ruled by a small military elite. Counts were appointed directly by and owed allegiance to the Carolingian (Frankish) emperor. The appointment to heirs could not be taken for granted. However, with the rise of the importance of the Bellonids and strong figures among them such as, Sunifred (fl. 844–848) and Wilfred the Hairy (c.870-897), and the weakening of Carolingian royal power, the appointment of heirs eventually become a formality. This trend resulted in the counts becoming de facto independent of the Carolingian crown under Borrell II in 987, starting since, to call themselves and to be known as dei gratia comes (counts by the grace of god) and dux catalanensis (Catalan dukes) or even Hispaniae subjogator (attorney of Hispania) and Propugnator et murus christiani populi (wall and defender of the Christian folk).\nThe many counties (aside from the counties of County of Pallars, County of Urgell and County of Empuries) were to be soon absorbed into the County of Barcelona and one of his counts, prince Ramon Berenguer IV, count of Barcelona married princess Petronilla of Aragon of the Kingdom of Aragon in 1150, uniting as equals the County of Barcelona and the Kingdom of Aragon. Thus, their son became the first king of the Crown of Aragon, ruling over both the Catalans and the Aragonese.\n## Creation\nThe reconquista from the Moors by the Franks began in 785. In 785, Rostany (or Rostaing) was made Count of Girona, the first of the Catalan counties to be established. Besalú and Empúries were originally part of Girona. In 801, in the greatest military triumph of his long career, the young Louis took Barcelona, the greatest city of the Catalan littoral. When Urgell and Cerdanya were subdued around 798, they were also made counties and Borrell was made count. He took a very active part in the subsequent conquest of Osona in 799 and the successful siege of Barcelona in 801. He was made count of Osona in 799, perhaps as a reward for his services. In 801, the greatest of the counties, Barcelona, was established under Bera. In 812, Count Odilo of Girona (which included Besalú and Empúries) died and the county also passed to Bera.\nIn 804 and 805, Borrell participated in the expeditions to Tortosa, but not in the subsequent campaigns of 808 and 809. On Borrell's death in 820, Osona was given to Rampon and Urgell and Cerdanya went to Aznar Galíndez. Also in 820, Bera went into political disfavour and lost the countships of Barcelona and Girona, which also went to Rampon.\nAround 813, Empúries became a separate county under Ermenguer, and in 817, it was united to the County of Roussillon. From 835 to 844, Sunyer I was count of Empúries and Peralada while Alaric I was count of Roussillon and Vallespir.\nBesalú was made a separate county in 878 for Radulf on the condition that it pass to the heirs of Wilfred the Hairy on his death. It went to Miro I the Younger in 912.\nBarcelona soon overshadowed the other counties in importance, especially during the reign of Wilfred the Hairy in the late 9th century. At that time, the power of the Carolingians was waning and the neglected Hispanic march was practically independent of royal authority. In the early 11th century, Berenguer Ramon I, Count of Barcelona, was able to submit to Sancho III of Navarre as his suzerain, even though he was still legally a vassal of Robert II of France. With the accession of Robert's father, Hugh Capet, the first non-Carolingian king, in 987, most of the Catalan counts refused to pay homage to the new dynasty. Over the next century, most of the Catalan counties came into the hands of the counts of Barcelona. In time, one of the Counts of Barcelona, Ramon Berenguer IV, married the heiress of Aragon, Petronella, uniting the counties under the count's power to that kingdom, creating the Crown of Aragon. Several of the later kings re-created some Catalan counties as appanages for younger sons.\n### Catalan Counties under House of Pallars\n(Note: According to some authors, the county of Pallars (and by extension Ribagorça) aren't exactly part of the Catalan group of counties )\n## The House of Trastámara and successors\n### House of Trastámara (1412-1516) and the Catalan Civil War (1462-1472)\nMartin died without legitimate descendants (interregnum 31 May 1410 – 24 June 1412). By the Compromise of Caspe of 1412 the County of Barcelona and the rest of the dominions of the Crown of Aragon passed to a branch of the House of Trastamara.\n### House of Bourbon (Spanish branch) 1714-1808\nIn 1714, Catalan lost their war (within the Spanish war of Succession conflict) against the remaining sole pretender to the Crown of Spain: Philip of Anjou. Through the Nueva Planta decrees, the new king Philip V abolished the Catalan Constitutions and dissolved the Crown of Aragon. The Principality of Catalonia became another province of the Crown of Castille, and thus the title of Count of Barcelona was emptied of real political significance and power. Since then, the numbering of the Counts of Barcelona follows that of the Crown of Castille. That is the reason why Philip of Anjou was called by the Catalan Authorities 'Felip IV' in 1702 but called himself 'Felipe V' when he sized the title of Count of Barcelona in 1714, after winning the war against the Catalans.\n### House of Bonaparte 1808-1813\nIn 1808 Charles IV and his son Ferdinand resign from their Crown of Spain titles and transfer them to Emperor Napoleon, who kept for himself the title of Count of Barcelona. By 1812, once he had full military control over the Principality of Catalonia, he separated it from the Crown of Spain and annexed it to the French Empire.\n### House of Bourbon (Reannexation to Spain) 1813-1931; 1975-present day\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars, Barcelona returned to Spanish domain.

{"name": "Blackwell Hall", "documents": ["# Blackwell Hall\nBlackwell Hall in the City of London (also known as Bakewell Hall) was the centre for the wool and cloth trade in England from mediaeval times until the 19th century. Cloth manufacturers and clothiers from provincial England brought their material to Blackwell Hall to display and sell it to merchants and drapers.\n## History\nBlackwell Hall was originally a buttressed stone hall adjacent to the Guildhall in private occupation dating from the early 13th century. In 1395, the City of London Corporation purchased it from the de Bankwell family (from which it derives its name) and it was established as a cloth market under Dick Whittington's first mayoralty in 1397 in order to provide the first place where non-citizen and foreigners could buy and sell cloth. It was rebuilt in 1588 and again after the Great Fire of London. It was demolished along with the chapel in 1820.\nIn the 17th century manufactured woollen cloth was the primary commodity traded in England, much of this passing through Blackwell Hall for the London market and for export. In the mid 17th century Blackwell Hall Factors were introduced as agents who charged a fee to handle the trade. By the 1690s the Blackwell-hall Factors had almost completely taken over the market and clothiers had lost their ancient right of selling their own goods. This was a long running controversy. In 1697 an Act of Parliament was passed \"to restore the Markett att Blackwell-Hall to the Clothiers & for regulating the Factors there\". The Act was ineffective and complaints about the factors continued until the middle of the 18th century.\nThere were about fifty Blackwell-Hall Factors at the end of the 17th century. They provided an important service to England's main industry at the time, supplying raw materials to the clothiers and giving credit to clothiers, drapers and exporters. This required considerable capital and although factors were still very active in the mid 18th century, their number had declined to a few wealthy men. The Gentleman's Magazine in 1739 noted. \"The Blackwell-Hall factor, originally but the servant of the maker, is now become his master, and not only his but the wool-merchant's and draper's too\".\nBy the 1780s the increasingly mechanised cloth trade, particularly in Yorkshire, was being handled by local merchants rather than through London, and the East India Company was handling its own exports.

{"name": "San Sebastián Cathedral", "documents": ["# San Sebastián Cathedral\nThe Cathedral of the Good Shepherd (Basque: Artzain Onaren katedrala, Spanish: Catedral del Buen Pastor de San Sebastián) located in the city of San Sebastián, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, Spain. It is the seat of the suffragan Diocese of San Sebastián and subordinated to the Archdiocese of Pamplona y Tudela. The most remarkable religious building of San Sebastián, it is endowed with a strong verticality and is the largest in Gipuzkoa. Its construction took place in the last years of the 19th century in a Historicist Neo-Gothic style. The church, dedicated to the Good Shepherd, has held the rank of cathedral since 1953.\n## History\nIn 1881 a Royal Order created a new parish division in San Sebastián. This new division included the creation of a parish, claimed for years by locals in the southern part of the city, which later became known as the \"Ensanche of Amara\". In August 1887 the City Council gave an area between the river Urumea and Beach of La Concha, occupied by sand dunes and marshes, to build the church. Until it was finished, the spiritual needs of the local congregation were met by a provisional parish, dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Opened in March 1888, this rudimentary church was made of wood and was between Loiola and Príncipe Streets.\nIn December 1887 a construction meeting chaired by the Dean D. Martín Lorenzo de Urizar Zalduegui-Ariño defined the bases of the project competition and set a budget of 750,000 pesetas, and like the capacity of the church and its architectural style, it should be pointed. Four projects were presented, with the chosen design being by the donostiarra architect Manuel de Echave, who was entrusted with the supervision of works. The new church would be dedicated to the Good Shepherd.\nThe Spanish Royal Family, who were vacationing in the city, were invited to the laying of the foundation stone. The events took place on September 29, 1888. The queen regent, Maria Christina, her children and the Infante Antonio, along with ministers and other officials, attended the solemn mass that the diocesan bishop D. Mariano Miguel Gómez held in the provisional parish church of the Sacred Heart. Following the ceremony, the royal entourage moved to the site of the new church and there proceeded to lay the foundation stone, which covered a lead box in which were enclosed pictures of the Pope and the Royal family, various coins of the time and copies of the Gazette of Madrid and of the Ecclesiastical Gazette. The minutes of the ceremony were signed by the baby king Alfonso XIII, aged two years and four months, for which his mother had to take his hand. It is the first signature of Alfonso XIII on an official document.\nManuel de Echave went on to oversee the works having as master of the same José Vicente Mendía and, after his (Mendia) death, the master mason Agustín de Zumalabe. The foundation work required a careful drainage of the site to provide consolidated sand. For the general architecture the sandstone quarries of Mount Igeldo were chosen. The vaults were made with tufa from Ocio (Álava) and slate roofs were brought from Angers (France). The workers were all Basques. For the size of the stone of the capitals, ornaments, windows and needles that decorate the interior and exterior, the models presented by the local artist Julio Gargallo were accepted.\nAfter just nine years of work (including almost two in which work was suspended for lack of resources, and the tower was not yet crowned), the Church of the Good Shepherd was consecrated for worship on July 30, 1897. Again, the Royal Family, the Queen Regent María Cristina, King Alfonso XIII and the Infanta María Teresa attended the grand ceremony. The mass was officiated by D. Ramón Fernández de Piérola, Bishop of Vitoria, the diocese to which then belonged Guipuzkoa. The tower was completed in 1899 under the direction of Ramón Cortázar. In the end, the construction of the church cost more than 1,500,000 pesetas, and that was not including the altars and altarpieces.\nPope John Paul I's papal bull Quo Commodus of November 2, 1949 created the Diocese of Bilbao and San Sebastián seceding from the Diocese of Vitoria. The first bishop was the Catalan ecclesiastic Jaime Font i Andreu, appointed to office on May 13, 1950, and took office on September 3 that year. With the need to choose a Donostiarra church to host the local diocese, the choice was, by its magnificence and modernity, the Church of the Good Shepherd. On July 30, 1953, finally, the church achieved the rank of Cathedral with the consecration of the new altar, acting as pastor D. Ignacio Lasquibar Olaciregui, who in 1954 took over from D. Román Mendiguchia.\nAfter four years of reforms and changes that were needed to put the church to its new use as a diocesan church. For this the presbytery was transformed with the installation of a new table after the removal of the original altar, of a florid Gothic style, carved in cedar wood by the Barcelonese workshops of Juan Riera, it was replaced by choir stalls and an image of the Good Shepherd. The Chapel of the Immaculate Conception was transformed into a chapter house, and the Chapel of Christ, in the crypt, became the new parish vestry, leaving the former sacristy for the exclusive service of the council.\nIn 1972, Bishop Jacinto Argaya Goicoechea undertook a second improvement of the church to mark the 75th anniversary of his inauguration. The neo-gothic pulpit made by Nicolás Medive, which was attached to one of the pillars, was removed. Also removed were the altars dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows, Virgin of the Rosary and Virgin of the Pillar. The roofs and windows were restored and walls and vaults were cleaned. The old floor of American oak was replaced by a new one in marble. The interior lighting was improved and new benches were installed.\n## Description\nIn the plans of the architect Manuel de Echave, who apparently was inspired by Cologne Cathedral, the dimensions of the church consist of:\nan area of 1,915 square metres (20,610 sq ft), a nave height of 25 metres (82 ft), a tower of 75 metres (246 ft), a central nave of 64 metres (210 ft) long by 36 metres (118 ft) wide at the crossing, and a capacity of 4,000 people.\nThis is a church with a Latin cross, three longitudinal aisles, transept nave and a pentagonal sanctuary. There is no ambulatory. The two gables of the transept house two large rose windows that accentuate the light inside the church. The naves up to the crossing, of which the wider and the highest is the central, are segmented into five rectangular sections covered with four-parts vaults of simple ribbing. The two arms of the transept consist of two sections arched in the same way. The crossing is the only section that features complex ribbing, incorporating tiercerons between the main veins. From the crossing to the head, the naves are extended with three sections. In this posterior space, the four aisles, two on each side, balance the width of the transept, resulting in two separate areas of equal height and divided into six sections separated by four pillars. The slender bell tower, located on the portico of the entrance, is clearly inspired by the spires of the Cologne Cathedral. The set of pilasters and buttresses terminating in pinnacles and spirelets decorated with buds enhance the verticality of the building.\n### Indoor furniture\nThe Main Chapel, since the reform of 1972, appears austerely furnished by choir stalls worked by the Goicoechea y Arín workshop of Vitoria. On it, resting on a pedestal that hangs from the central boss of the apse, the sculpture of the Good Shepherd, which was on the original Neo-gothic altar. A work of the Barcelonan artist Joseph Llimona, also maker of the figures of the Four Evangelists, from the old altar and which today are on the pillars of the crossing. Under the rose windows of the transept the initial design included two small pedestrian doors that were finally replaced by two altarpieces, of Neo-Gothic style and gold-covered, these were placed as the devotions of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Conception of Mary. They were installed in 1907 and 1917. Other items of interest are the altars and shrines of the Holy Family, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Saint Anthony and Francis of Assisi, works by Julio Gargallo. This artist also worked on the altars of Teresa of Ávila and Our Lady of Perpetual Help. The sculpture of the Our Lady of the Rosary presided over an altar that was decommissioned in 1972.\n#### Crypt\nLocated under the presbytery, the crypt functions as parish sacristy since the reform of 1949–1953. The remains of first parish priest, D. Martín Lorenzo de Urizar, are entombed here..\n#### Stained Glass\nThe cathedral's stained glass was designed by Juan Bautista Lázaro and made by the workshop of Bolinaga and Cía., from León, and Pujol, from Barcelona. That which occupies the seven double windows of the apse represents the twelve apostles and the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. There are also figurative windows in the baptistry. The rest of the stained glass is incorporated in double (at top) and triple (at bottom) windows and runs around the most of the side walls. Two rose windows open at the ends of the transept.\n#### Organ\nThe current organ is the second that has been in the cathedral. It was installed in 1954. According to data published at the time, it was the largest organ in Spain and one of the largest in Europe. Its main console consists of five keyboards for hands, one for feet and 106 stops; also, in the presbytery lies an \"echo organ\" with two manual keyboards, pedals and 20 stops. The choir organ houses in its interior and exterior 9,535 pipes, the largest measures 10 meters, the whole thing weighing 30 tons. The huge instrument cost more than 1.5 million pesetas, thanks to the legacy of the Fermín Lasala, Duke of Mandas (1832–1917). It was built by Organería Española, of Azpeitia, and its pumps, of several horsepower, were purchased from the workshop of Meindinger from Basel.\n## Gallery\nTower Apse Header Altarpiece of the Sacred Heart of Jesus Organ"], "selected_questions": ["Where is the San Sebastián Cathedral located?", "What is the architectural style of the San Sebastián Cathedral?", "What is the name of the current organ in the cathedral and when was it installed?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The San Sebastián Cathedral is located in the city of San Sebastián, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, Spain.", "The architectural style of the San Sebastián Cathedral is Historicist Neo-Gothic.", "The name of the current organ in the cathedral is not mentioned in the reference provided."], "InternLM_answers": ["The San Sebastián Cathedral is located in the city of San Sebastián, in the province of Guipúzcoa, in the autonomous community of the Basque Country, in northern Spain.", "The San Sebastián Cathedral is an example of the Gothic Revival architectural style.", "The current organ in the cathedral is the Mander organ, installed in 1993."], "human_GPT3.5_answers_D_ann": [["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> The Cathedral of the Good Shepherd [...] located in the city of San Sebastián, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, Spain"], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> Its construction took place in the last years of the 19th century in a Historicist Neo-Gothic style"], ["<Hallucination> Unverifiable\n<Reference> The current organ is the second that has been in the cathedral.It was installed in 1954\n<Correction>  \"The name of the current organ in the cathedral is not mentioned in the reference provided.\" to \"\""]], "human_InternLM_answers_ann": [["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> The Cathedral of the Good Shepherd [...] located in the city of San Sebastián, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, Spain"], ["<Hallucination> Contradictory\n<Reference> Its construction took place in the last years of the 19th century in a Historicist Neo-Gothic style\n<Correction>  \"Gothic Revival\" to \"Historicist Neo-Gothic\"."], ["<Hallucination> Contradictory\n<Reference> The current organ is the second that has been in the cathedral.It was installed in 1954\n<Correction>  \"The current organ in the cathedral is the Mander organ, installed in 1993.\" to \"The current organ in the cathedral was installed in 1954.\""]], "language": "en"}

{"name": "Macedonia (Roman province)", "documents": ["# Macedonia (Roman province)\nMacedonia (Greek: Μακεδονία) was a province of the Roman Empire, encompassing the territory of the former Antigonid Kingdom of Macedonia, which had been conquered by Rome in 168 BC at the conclusion of the Third Macedonian War. The province was created in 146 BC, after the Roman general Quintus Caecilius Metellus defeated Andriscus of Macedon, the last self-styled king of Macedonia in the Fourth Macedonian War. The province incorporated the former kingdom of Macedonia with the addition of Epirus, Thessaly, and parts of Illyria, Paeonia and Thrace.\nDuring the Republican period, the province was of great military significance, as the main bulwark protecting the Aegean region from attacks from the north. The Via Egnatia, which crossed the province from west to east was of great strategic importance, providing the main overland link between Rome and its domains in the Eastern Mediterranean. In this period, campaigns against the Dardani and Scordisci to the north and the Thracians to the east were nearly constant. By the first century BC, the province notionally extended to the Danube.\nMacedonia was a central theatre for several campaigns of the civil wars at the end of the Republic, including the Battles of Pharsalus and Philippi. During the Second Triumvirate, it fell within Marc Antony's sphere. Several important Roman military colonies were established in Macedonia in this period. After the province came under the control of the Augustus following the Battle of Actium in 30 BC, the northern sections were split off as the provinces of Moesia, Dalmatia and Pannonia, meaning that the province lost much of its military role in defending the Danube border, but it remained important for supply purposes and as a source of military manpower. Until AD 15 and again after AD 44, Macedonia was a senatorial province, governed by a proconsul.\nThroughout the Imperial Period, Macedonia was a prosperous region with several thriving cities, notably Thessalonica and Philippi. These communities were organised in a similar way to other cities of the Roman Empire and were largely self-governing. Greek was the main language of the region, but Latin was used for official purposes and in the Roman colonies. There were substantial Christian communities in the province by the mid-first century AD.\nIn Late Antiquity, the province was split into several smaller units, but the old provincial capital, Thessalonica, became the regional centre for the Balkan region and was briefly an Imperial capital under Licinius. The provincial system gradually faded away, until it was replaced altogether by the theme system in the mid-7th century AD, but the region continued to form part of the Eastern Roman Empire until the end of the fourteenth century.\n## History\n### Macedonian Wars\nThe Romans clashed with the Macedonian kingdom in three wars in the early third century BC. After defeating Perseus in the Third Macedonian War, Rome abolished the Macedonian monarchy and divided Macedon into four client republics, called merides, with capitals located at Amphipolis, Thessalonica, Pella, and Pelagonia, which were members of a federal league, the League of the Macedonians. Numismatic evidence indicates that the cult of Roma was introduced at this time, being depicted on coins of Amphipolis, Pella, and Thessalonica in this period. Thessaly had been separated from the Macedonian monarchy already, following the Second Macedonian War and a separate Thessalian League was created with Roman permission in 194 BC, with Zeus Eleutherius ('of Freedom') and Athena Itonia as its patron deities. Its coinage superseded that of the individual Thessalian cities and continued until the end of the first century BC.\nThe kingdom was briefly reunited in 150 BC by the pretender Andriscus (or 'Pseudo-Philip'), leading to the Fourth Macedonian War. After defeating Andriscus near Pydna in 148 BC, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus made Macedonia into Rome's fifth provincia - the first new province since the creation of Hispania Ulterior and Citerior in 197 BC. Surviving sources do not explicitly discuss how or why it was decided to convert the region into a permanent province. A number of factors may have been involved, including increased familiarity with territorial expansion, the proven failure of the previous system to maintain the peace, the desire for a new base from which further military expeditions could be undertaken in order to acquire booty and triumphs, and the desire for further tax revenue. The four republics continued to exist as subdivisions of the province, as did the federal league.  The date of the establishment of the province in autumn 148 BC is indicated by the epoch date of the provincial era, but in practice it may have been a gradual process.\n### Republican province\nAt its creation, the province of Macedonia encompassed Macedon itself, Paeonia and parts of Illyria, Thessaly to the south, and Epirus to the west. Notionally, the northern border ran from Lissus on the Adriatic coast, due east until it reached the Hebrus river, which formed the eastern border with Thrace. These borders were only loosely defined and dependent on the military competence of the governors, with Cicero claiming that \"for the governors of Macedonia, the borders were always the same as those marked by swords and shields.\" The capital was Thessalonica and the governor held proconsular status.\nTwo years after the foundation of the new province, in 146 BC, Romans defeated the Achaean League in the Achaean War and gained control of the rest of Mainland Greece. Scholars disagree on whether or not Achaia was formally incorporated into the province of Macedonia following this defeat, but intermittent interventions in Achaian affairs by the governors are attested.\n#### Via Egnatia\nSometime after 146 BC, Gnaeus Egnatius initiated the construction of the Via Egnatia, a Roman road, which began at Dyrrhachium on the Adriatic coast opposite the terminus of the Via Appia in Italy, stretched across the Pindus mountains and continued through Macedonia to Thessalonica, and from there to Cypsela, on the east bank of the Hebrus river. This stretch was completed by 120 BC; it followed a pre-existing route, but was a more solid, level road than the previous road, with a width of between three and six metres. A second road from the Adriatic coast at Apollonia, which joined the main Via Egnatia somewhere inland was added shortly after 120 BC. Later in the second century BC, the eastern end of the road was extended all the way to the Byzantium. The road was important for military and economic purposes, providing the main overland link between Rome and its domains in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n#### Northern and eastern campaigns\nMacedonia was of central importance to Roman military strategy in this period as a bulwark against attacks from the north. The Dardani to the northwest, had initially supported the Romans in their conquest of Macedonia, but after 148 BC, they increasingly came into conflict with the Romans. There were also occasional conflicts with the Thracians to the east. However, the key enemy of the Romans in this period were the Scordisci, a Celtic group that largely supplanted the Dardanians as the most powerful group in the central Balkans. They first invaded Macedonia in 149 BC during the Fourth Macedonian War and had to be driven out by Metellus.\nIn the first years of the province two pretenders attempted to restore the Macedonian kingdom. The first, Alexander, invaded from Thrace in 148 BC and was defeated by Metellus. The second, referred to in the sources as 'Pseudo-Philip' or 'Pseudo-Perseus' also invaded from the east, in 143 or 142, with an army of up to 16,000 men, but was defeated by the quaestor Tremellus Scrofa. The Scordisci invaded in 141 BC and defeated a Roman army commanded by Decimus Junius Silanus Manlianus or, less likely, Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica. In belated response to this defeat, Marcus Cosconius launched an attack on the Scordisci in 135 BC, defeating them in Thrace. The delay may have been because Roman attention was focussed on the construction of the Via Egnatia.\nIn 119 BC, the Scordisci invaded again, ravaging the area near Stobi. The praetor Sextus Pompeius met the forces in battle and was killed, leaving his quaestor Marcus Annius to regroup and drive the Scordisci out, defeating a second invasion with the help of the Thracians. Following this set-back, a series of consuls were sent to Macedonia, apparently to settle the threat from the Scordisci decisively. The first of these, Quintus Fabius Maximus Eburnus arrived in 115 BC but his activities are not attested. In 114 BC, his successor, Gaius Porcius Cato launched a large-scale invasion, but he was defeated and nearly the whole army was killed. The Romans dispatched several further commanders, Gaius Caecilius Metellus Caprarius in 113 BC and Marcus Livius Drusus in 112, who inflicted defeats on the Thracians and the Scordisci respectively. From 110 to 107 BC, Marcus Minucius Rufus campaigned against the Scordisci and the Bessian tribe of Thracians to the east, bringing an end to their raids for about twenty years.\nAfter this, the Romans turned their attention to the eastern border. The Romans defeated some Thracians under an unnamed commander in 104 BC. In 101 or 100 BC, Titus Didius conquered an area referred to as the \"Caenic Chersonese\" (exact location unknown, but some region of the Thracian coast). Another unnamed commander defeated the Maedian Thracians in the east and the Dardanians in the northwest in 97 BC. Gaius Sentius Saturninus was defeated by the Maedi in 92 BC and was involved in a conflict with a Thracian king called Sordinus in 89 BC, only achieving victory after a struggle. From 87 BC onwards, Thracian forces allied with Mithridates VI attacked Macedonia, as part of the First Mithridatic War. In 84 BC a force of Scordisci, Dardianians and Maedi penetrated all the way to Delphi and sacked the sanctuary, before they were violently expelled by Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus (consul 83 BC).\nIn the aftermath of the Mithridatic Wars, the Romans again launched a concerted military effort in the region. Before the war, governors had tended to be praetors or propraetors, usually in office for a single year. Henceforth, they were consuls or proconsuls and often held command for several years. Appius Claudius Pulcher had some success in the Rhodope Mountains in 77 BC, but was replaced after his death from illness by C. Scribonius Curio, who was given a force of five legions. He campaigned from 75 to 74 BC, becoming the first Roman commander to lead an army to the Danube and reduced the Dardanians to submission. Between 73 and 71 BC, Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus led another force of five legions against the Bessi and entered Moesia, bringing the Greek cities on the west coast of the Black Sea under Roman control and campaigning against the Getae all the way to the mouth of the Danube. These campaigns were intended to secure the northern border so that Macedonia and Greece would no longer be threatened by raids and to put Rome in a better position to confront Mithridates VI in future conflicts. Efforts to consolidate these enormous conquests continued for decades, often meeting with rebuffs, most notably the two campaigns of Gaius Antonius Hybrida in the north ca. 62-61 BC, in which he was defeated disastrously by the Dardianians and at the Battle of Histria by the Bastarnae.\nThe governorship of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus from 57 to 55 BC is the subject of Cicero's In Pisonem, in which Caesoninus is accused of corruption, abuse, and murder of the provincials on a grand scale, as well as shaving sparked another invasion by the Dardianians and Bessi that even placed Thessaloniki under siege, but the speech may not give an accurate picture of Caesoninus' conduct.\n#### Civil wars\nMacedonia was one of the main arenas of the civil wars at the end of the Roman Republic. When Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC, starting Caesar's Civil War, his opponents, led by Pompey abandoned Italy and retreated to Macedonia with five legions. Around two hundred Senators set themselves up in Thessalonica as a Senate in exile and raised a further legion from veterans in Macedonia and Crete. At the beginning of 48 BC, Caesar crossed the Adriatic and besieged Pompey at Dyrrhachium. During this period, one Menedemos came to Caesar as a delegate from \"the part of the province that was called free\" offering him support; he was subsequently captured by Pompey's forces and executed. After several months, Pompey broke out of Dyrrhachium and headed southeast toward Thessaly. On the march he was met by another Macedonian, Acornion of Dionysiopolis, who came offering an alliance with Burebista, the king of Dacia. However, this offer had come too late to be of use to Pompey. Caesar decisively defeated him at the Battle of Pharsalus in August 48 BC and he fled for Egypt. On taking control of the province, Caesar separated it from Greece to the south for the first time. This division was reversed after his death in 44 BC, but would be revived in the Imperial period.\nAfter the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, the assassins, led by Brutus and Cassius, also fled east. Caesar's former lieutenant, Mark Antony passed a law requiring the governor, Quintus Hortensius Hortalus to hand the province over to Antony. Instead, he chose to place the province under Brutus' control - a move that was recognised by the Senate in 43 BC. This led Mark Antony to ally with Octavian in the Second Triumvirate and invade Macedonia, defeating Brutus and his forces at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC.\nAfter Philippi, Macedonia fell within the territories assigned to Mark Antony and it was governed by his legates until war broke out between Octavian and Antony in 32 BC and Antony was defeated in 31 BC at the Battle of Actium, after which Macedonia and the rest of the Eastern Mediterranean came under Octavian's control, marking the beginning of the Principate.\n### Principate\nFollowing Actium, Octavian entrusted Macedonia to the proconsul M. Licinius Crassus, grandson of Crassus the triumvir, who led a campaign into the north that lasted until 27 BC, finally subjugating the whole region south of the Danube, for which he was granted a triumph.\nIn the Augustan Settlement of 27 BC, provinces were divided into two categories: imperial provinces, which fell were governed by legates appointed by the Emperor, and senatorial provinces, which continued to be governed by senators who had previously served as consuls or praetors. Most of the provinces with a large military presence on the borders of the empire were Imperial provinces, but Macedonia was anomalous in being a senatorial province despite its military significance. The territories south of Thermopylae and the Ceraunian Mountains now became the separate province of Achaia. This province included the territory which would become the province of Epirus (later Epirus Vetus) under Emperor Trajan.\nMoesia was split off as a separate military command some time before 10 BC, and had become a separate province by AD 6. Territories to the northwest of Macedonia in Illyricum were separated off into the provinces of Dalmatia and Pannonia. In AD 15, complaints about the corruption of the governors led Tiberius to convert Macedonia and Achaia into imperial provinces, under the control of the governor of Moesia, but Claudius made them both Senatorial provinces once more in AD 44  In the same year, the portion of Macedonia between the Hebrus and Nestus rivers in the east and the island of Thasos were handed over to the newly created province of Thrace.\nThe establishment of new provinces to the north and the consolidation of Roman control in the Balkans in general led to a decline in the military importance of Macedonia to Rome, as the legions defending the northern border were henceforth based in Dalmatia, Moesia, and Thrace. Nevertheless, the province continued to provide a vital role in the transport of supplies from Italy to the northern and eastern borders of the Empire, as well as serving as a source of manpower.\n#### Organisation\nThe cities of the province had a range of different statuses. Six Roman colonies (coloniae) were established in the Triumviral period: Cassandrea, established in the late 40s BC by the proconsul Quintus Hortensius Hortalus, Philippi (Colonia Iulia Augusta Philippensis) founded by Antony's legate Quintus Paquius Rufus, Dium, Pella, Byllis, and Dyrrhachium. These communities were settled with veterans who became or remained Roman citizens. Local inhabitants of these communities were not expelled, but they did not receive citizenship of the new colonies or of Rome, except perhaps for some members of the local elite. Some scholars have suggested that these coloniae formed \"double communities,\" with the old Greek city-state (polis) and the new colonia existing side-by-side. This now seems unlikely, but has not been disproven. Stobi was a municipium. Amphipolis, Thessalonica, Abdera, and Maroneia held the status of 'free cities' (civitates liberae), and Edessa was probably an 'allied city' (civitas foederata).\nIn the Republican period a cult of \"the Roman Benefactors\" (Rhomaioi euergetai), the goddess Roma, and Zeus \"Eleutherios\" (\"of freedom\") developed in Macedonia. This cult is first attested in 95 or possibly 119 BC, but probably dates back to the establishment of the province. It endured in the Imperial period. The Roman Imperial cult was introduced under Augustus, with numismatic and epigraphic evidence attesting to the worship of Julius Caesar as Divus Julius following Actium. Under Tiberius, cults of Augustus and of Livia are attested as well, while divine honours for Caligula and subsequent emperors are attested during their own lifetimes.\nThe cities of Macedonia were arranged into the League of the Macedonians (Greek: koinon ton Makedonon), with its seat at Beroea. From 27 BC, they used their own \"Macedonian era,\" in which the years were counted from the Battle of Actium in 31/30 BC. This league was a continuation of an institution first attested under Philip V. In the Imperial period, its main duties related to the Imperial cult, especially the organisation of games in honour of the emperors. It also hosted a local version of the Olympic games, and from AD 229, games in honour of Alexander the Great. From the time of the emperor Claudius until the end of the second century AD, the league minted its own coinage, with the thunderbolt, a traditional symbol of Macedon on the reverse. In the third century AD, the league continued to mint coinage, but with new types, relating to athletic competition. Through this institution, Macedonian identity and loyalty to the Roman emperor were closely aligned.\nThere was a separate League for the Thessalians.\n### Late Antiquity\nThe reforms of Diocletian around AD 293 saw provinces replaced by dioceses and praetorian prefectures as the first order subdivision of the Roman Empire and provinces began to be split into smaller units. The province of Macedonia was initially part of the Diocese of Moesia, but subsequently became part of a new Diocese of Macedonia (administered from Thessaloniki), one of three dioceses comprising the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum (administered from Sirmium until 379, then from Thessaloniki). Meanwhile, the province of Macedonia was divided into a number of smaller provinces.\nEpirus Nova (\"New Epirus\") or Illyria Graeca or Illyris proper, which was established by Diocletian, was the first province to be divided off. Dyrrachium (or Epidamnus) was the capital. The region of Epirus Nova corresponded to a portion of Illyria that was then \"partly Hellenic and partly Hellenized\". Macedonia Prima (\"First Macedonia\"), encompassing most of the Kingdom of Macedonia, coinciding with most of the modern Greek region of Macedonia, and had Thessalonica as its capital. Macedonia Salutaris (\"Wholesome Macedonia\"), also known as Macedonia Secunda (\"Second Macedonia\"), partially encompassing both Pelagonia and Dardania and containing the whole of Paeonia. The province mostly coincides with the present-day North Macedonia. The town of Stobi located to the junction of the Crna Reka and Vardar rivers, the former capital of Paeonia, became the provincial capital. Thessalia encompassed the area of ancient Thessaly, in the south of ancient Macedonia and was subdivided into Thessalia Prima and Thessalia Secunda.\nWhen the Prefecture of Macedonia was divided between the Western and Eastern Empires in 379, the Macedonian provinces were included in Eastern Illyricum. With the permanent division of the Empire in 395, Macedonia passed to the East, which would evolve into the Byzantine Empire.\n### Economy\nThe reign of Augustus (27 BC–14 AD) began a long period of peace, prosperity and wealth for Macedonia, although its importance in the economic standing of the Roman world diminished when compared to its neighbor, Asia Minor.\nThe economy was greatly stimulated by the construction of the Via Egnatia during 130s and 120s BC, the installation of Roman merchants in the cities, and the founding of Roman colonies. The Imperial government brought, along with its roads and administrative system, an economic boom, which benefited both the Roman ruling class and the lower classes. With vast arable and rich pastures, the great ruling families amassed huge fortunes in the society based on slave labor.\nThe improvement of the living conditions of the productive classes brought about an increase in the number artisans and craftspeople to the region. Stonemasons, miners, blacksmiths, etc. were employed in every kind of commercial activity and craft. Greek people were also widely employed as tutors, educators and doctors throughout the Roman world.\nThe export economy was based essentially on agriculture and livestock, while iron, copper, and gold along with such products as timber, resin, pitch, hemp, flax, and fish were also exported. Another source of wealth was the kingdom's ports, such as Thessalonica, Cassandreia.\n## List of Roman governors\n### Imperial\nMarcus Licinius Crassus (31-27 BC) Marcus Primus (c.24/23 BC) Lucius Tarius Rufus (18-16 BC) Publius Vinicius (AD 2/3) Publius Memmius Regulus (with Achaea, between AD 31 and 37) Marcus Helvius Geminus (before 54) Marcus Julius Romulus (between 54 and 68) Marcus Vettius Bolanus (before 66) Lucius Antonius Saturninus (76/77) P.

{"name": "Camp Concordia", "documents": ["# Camp Concordia\nCamp Concordia was a prisoner-of-war camp that operated from 1943–1945. Its location is two miles north and one mile east of Concordia, Kansas. The camp was used primarily for German Army prisoners during World War II who were captured in battles that took place in Africa.\nCamp Concordia was the largest POW camp in Kansas, holding over 4,000 prisoners (some sources cite as high as 8,000 prisoners). The camp consisted of a complex of 300 buildings and was staffed by 800 United States soldiers.\n## Daily life\nThe prisoners arrived at Camp Concordia by train. Authorities believed the soldiers could provide useful labor for agriculture, and, almost immediately, the Germans started working with local farmers.\n### Interactions between prisoners\nAt least two reported cases of executions are recorded, both were made by prisoners on fellow prisoners (some of whom were Gestapo agents). When conclusive evidence arose, the offenders were tried and sentenced to the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth.\n### Interaction between locals\n\"Difficulties between POWs and local residents were few, and in fact friendships formed\", stated Lowell May, president of the camp's preservation society. \"Only a handful of escape attempts occurred, none successful.\" Life at the camp was easy compared with the war in Europe. Prisoners played outdoor sports, listened to band performances and took courses offered by the University of Kansas.\n### Famous prisoners\nKarl Bracher, historian. Harald Deilmann, architect and author. Reinhard Mohn, owner of the transnational media corporation Bertelsmann AG.\n### Return to Germany\nThe prisoners headed back to Germany in the autumn of 1945, some of them harboring pleasant memories of Kansas. Franz Kramer of Gundelfingen, Germany, said: \"There was no reason to criticize American authorities. The prisoners felt that they were well treated. We learned a little of the American way of life and saw part of the vast country.\"\n### Later years\nOnce the POW camp closed, one of the buildings, Building T-9, was on a list acquired by the Federal Land Bank on June 7, 1947. In October 1947, the City of Concordia purchased 166.7 acres of camp acreage, including buildings, with the intent of establishing a park and re-locating the Cloud County fairgrounds to the site. Plans for the park never came to pass and the city eventually sold Building T-9 as well as other buildings and acreage. T-9 was subsequently used as a skating rink, hog farm, canoe factory, and during the 1960s, as storage for a horse racetrack called Thundercloud Park located on the camp property.\n## The camp today\nSeveral structures of the camp remain, including a prison warehouse used for storage, an officers club, and a restored guard tower. Only the guard tower is easily accessible to the public. The land is now used primarily for farming, although some houses have been built on the land as well. The original guardhouse remains and has been restored.

{"name": "Titelberg", "documents": ["# Titelberg\nTitelberg (Luxembourgish: Tëtelbierg) is the site of a large Celtic settlement or oppidum in the extreme south west of Luxembourg. In the 1st century BCE, this thriving community was probably the capital of the Treveri people. The site thus provides telling evidence of urban civilization in the century before the Roman conquest.\n## Geography\nThe site lies some 3 km to the south west of Pétange and 3 km north west of Differdange on a bare plateau some 390 m above sea level. It is surrounded by steep forested slopes which run down to the Chiers, a hundred meters below. It can be reached from Niedercorn by taking the road to Roudenhaff and making a right turn towards the Fond de Gras.\n## Background\nThe Celts inhabited large areas of Europe from the Danube to the Rhine and Rhône during the 6th to 1st centuries BCE, a period sometimes referred to as La Tène after a site in Switzerland where continental Celtic remains were first discovered. It was around 100 BCE that the Treveri, one of the Celtic tribes, came into a period of prosperity. They constructed a number of settlements or oppida near the Moselle valley in what is now southern Luxembourg, western Germany and eastern France. Titelberg was by far the largest of the Treveri settlements, no doubt as a result of its proximity to two of the most important Celtic roads, one from the south connecting the Rhone to the upper Moselle and the north, the other leading to Reims and the west. Another attraction were the iron ore which could be mined in the immediate vicinity and fertile lands.\n## The site\nCovering an area of some 50 ha, the oval-shaped Titelberg plateau is approximately 1 km long (NW to SE) and 500 m wide. It was occupied continuously for 700 years from about 300 BCE. There is evidence of sporadic settlements dating back even further, perhaps to 2000 BCE or before. From the 1st century BCE and during the Gallo-Roman period, foundations of masonry replaced the earlier, less durable constructions. These, together with the 9-m high earthen ramparts around the periphery, clearly demonstrate the importance of the Celtic oppidum which appears to have been the seat of the Treveri chiefs.\nAlthough some interest had been shown in the site in 1928, serious archaeological excavations began in 1968 and continue today. These have been coordinated by Luxembourg's National Museum of History and Art with the assistance of specialists from the University of Missouri in the 1960s. In particular, the digs have unearthed the main residential area in the centre of the plateau and the public or recreational area, a few hundred meters to the south east. Both are located to the west of the farm road through the site which loosely follows the path of the main Celtic road that connects the two gates of the oppidum. There is also evidence of metal working and coin-minting activities long before the Roman conquest.\n### Celtic period\nWhile there is evidence that the site was probably inhabited as far back as 2000 BCE, the beginnings of urban civilization can certainly be traced back to the 2nd century BCE when there were bronze-working shops at the site. In the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE, the oppidum had become a civilized community trading with other Gallic centres. The Treveri nobles appear to have occupied the dwellings at the centre of the plateau. The Celtic tombs excavated in the vicinity, specifically at Clemency, at Scheierheck near Goeblange and at Kreckelbierg near Nospelt contain a range of articles including wine flagons, spurs, knives, lances and oil lanterns testifying to the aristocracy of those buried.\nThe entire site was originally surrounded by 10 m high, reinforced ramparts of Murus Gallicus type, with fortified doors at either end of the main road through the site. The ramparts then collapsed over the years due to the lack of maintenance after the Roman conquest.\nA deep ditch, 4 m wide, perpendicular to the road, separated the residential space from the public space. The residential area covering about 30 ha consisted of rectangular houses, 14 m long by 8 m wide, built of light masonry. They were equipped with fireplaces and sometimes ovens. Trenches to drain rain water among the houses were also discovered. In the public space, the remains of a large hall, 14 m square, have been found, but no dwellings were discovered. This could have been a meeting place for political, economical and/or religious purposes.\nOne of the most important finds on Titelberg has been a huge number of Celtic coins which come not only from the Treveri themselves but from several other Celtic tribes. This indicates that it was a centre of trade and commerce during the Celtic period. In addition, facilities for minting coins have also been excavated close to the residential area and appear to have been used over an extended period.\nA very large number of both Celtic and Gallo-Roman fibulae have also been found on the site. In a multitude of different shapes and sizes, these bronze clasps, sometimes hinged, were used either as ornamental brooches or for holding garments together.\nReconstruction of the Titelberg Murus Gallicus Celtic sanctuary or hall Goeblange-Nospelt Celtic grave Goeblange-Nospelt Celtic grave Decorated vessel from Goeblange-Nospelt Remains of the oppidum ramparts\n### Gallo-Roman period\nAbout 20 years after the Roman conquest, the Celtic oppidum was completely reworked and at least two streets perpendicular to the main were constructed. The houses too were replaced with Roman buildings which had stone foundations and cellars.\nThe Treveri, despite their conflictual relationship with the Roman world, apparently adopted Roman culture and religion fairly quickly, even long before the Roman conquest. Titelberg, though no longer a capital, became a prosperous vicus with a range of activities, especially metal working. In particular, minting of coins and smelting extended at least until around 337 as one of the coins found at the site of the smelter bears the likeness of Constantine II. In the former public area, a square-shaped monumental Gallo-Roman edifice was built among dwellings and later transformed into a traditional Gallo-Roman fanum, a square-shaped temple with a roofed porch on all sides of its sacred room.\nFoundations in the residential area Foundations in the residential area Foundations in the public area Early Gallo-Roman temple at Titelberg\n## Similar sites\nTitelberg resembles a number of other Celtic oppidum sites. In particular, Bibracte, probably the capital of the Aedui, near Autun in France has similar dimensions and fortifications. Manching in Bavaria is a considerably larger site and Ensérune near Béziers in southern France also has a hilltop position."], "selected_questions": ["What evidence suggests that Titelberg was a thriving community in the 1st century BCE?", "When did serious archaeological excavations at Titelberg begin?", "How were the houses in the residential area of Titelberg constructed during the Celtic period?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The evidence that suggests that Titelberg was a thriving community in the 1st century BCE includes:\n\n1.

The bridge, constructed in 1946, is the earliest prestressed concrete railway bridge in the United Kingdom, with only some examples in Switzerland being earlier. It is bridge number 54 on the Kirkby branch line and is at a line distance of 18 miles 1,032 yards (29.91 km).\n## History and construction\nThe bridge was constructed as a test case, to see if prestressed concrete construction was feasible for rail projects in the UK, by the LMS railway company, and designed by their chief civil engineer William Kelly Wallace. The beams used were prestressed using the Freyssinet system, in which concrete is precast with stressed high-tensile-strength metal tendons, which consist of multiple steel wires, running down the length of them. In construction, the beams internal rods are tightened and tied together so, under live load, they act as one. The LMS developed this system in the 1930s, and prestressed beams were first used for emergency repairs during World War II, but the Adam Viaduct first to use them for a full-scale project. The benefits of the system were found to be that it was quicker to install, more economical and longer-lasting, and with the bridge being less lively than traditional designs.\nThe bridge has six I-beams for each track and two beams for each parapet, and they are 2 feet 8 inches (0.81 m) deep.

{"name": "Verona", "documents": ["# Verona\nVerona (/vəˈroʊnə/ və-ROH-nə, Italian:  (listen); Venetian: Verona or Veròna) is a city on the Adige River in Veneto, Italy, with 258,031 inhabitants. It is one of the seven provincial capitals of the region. It is the largest city municipality in the region and the second largest in northeastern Italy. The metropolitan area of Verona covers an area of 1,426 km2 (550.58 sq mi) and has a population of 714,310 inhabitants. It is one of the main tourist destinations in northern Italy because of its artistic heritage and several annual fairs and shows as well as the opera season in the Arena, an ancient Roman amphitheater.\nBetween the 13th and 14th century the city was ruled by the della Scala Family. Under the rule of the family, in particular of Cangrande I della Scala, the city experienced great prosperity, becoming rich and powerful and being surrounded by new walls. The Della Scala era is survived in numerous monuments around Verona.\nTwo of William Shakespeare's plays are set in Verona: Romeo and Juliet (which also features Romeo's visit to Mantua) and The Two Gentlemen of Verona. It is unknown if Shakespeare ever visited Verona or Italy, but his plays have lured many visitors to Verona and surrounding cities. Verona was also the birthplace of Isotta Nogarola, who is said to be the first major female humanist and one of the most important humanists of the Renaissance. In November 2000 the city was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO because of its urban structure and architecture.\nThe city is scheduled to host the 2026 Winter Olympics closing ceremonies.\n## History\nThe precise details of Verona's early history remain a mystery along with the origin of the name. One theory is it was a city of the Euganei, who were obliged to give it up to the Cenomani (550 BC). With the conquest of the Valley of the Po, the Veronese territory became Roman (about 300 BC). Verona became a Roman colonia in 89 BC. It was classified as a municipium in 49 BC, when its citizens were ascribed to the Roman tribe Poblilia or Publicia.\nThe city became important because it was at the intersection of several roads. Stilicho defeated Alaric and his Visigoths here in 403. But, after Verona was conquered by the Ostrogoths in 489, the Gothic domination of Italy began. Theoderic the Great was said to have built a palace there. It remained under the power of the Goths throughout the Gothic War (535–552), except for a single day in 541, when the Byzantine officer Artabazes made an entrance. The defections of the Byzantine generals over the booty made it possible for the Goths to regain possession of the city. In 552 Valerian vainly endeavored to enter the city, but it was only when the Goths were fully overthrown that they surrendered it.\nIn 569, it was taken by Alboin, King of the Lombards, in whose kingdom it was, in a sense, the second most important city. There, Alboin was killed by his wife in 572. The dukes of Treviso often resided there. Adalgisus, son of Desiderius, in 774 made his last desperate resistance in Verona to Charlemagne, who had destroyed the Lombard kingdom. Verona became the ordinary residence of the kings of Italy, the government of the city becoming hereditary in the family of Count Milo, progenitor of the counts of San Bonifacio. From 880 to 951 the two Berengarii resided there.\nUnder Holy Roman and Austrian rule, Verona was alternately known in German as Bern, Welsch-Bern or Dietrichsbern. Otto I ceded to Verona the marquisate dependent on the Duchy of Bavaria, however, the increasing wealth of the burgher families eclipsed the power of the counts, and in 1135 Verona was organised as a free commune. In 1164 Verona joined with Vicenza, Padua and Treviso to create the Veronese League, which was integrated with the Lombard League in 1167 to battle against Frederick I Barbarossa. Victory was achieved at the Battle of Legnano in 1176, and the Treaty of Venice signed in 1177 followed by the Peace of Constance in 1183.\nWhen Ezzelino III da Romano was elected podestà in 1226, he converted the office into a permanent lordship. In 1257 he caused the slaughter of 11,000 Paduans on the plain of Verona (Campi di Verona). Upon his death, the Great Council elected Mastino I della Scala as podestà, and he converted the \"signoria\" into a family possession, though leaving the burghers a share in the government. Failing to be re-elected podestà in 1262, he affected a coup d'état, and was acclaimed Capitano del Popolo, with the command of the communal troops. Long internal discord took place before he succeeded in establishing this new office, to which was attached the function of confirming the podestà. In 1277, Mastino della Scala was killed by the faction of the nobles.\nThe reign of his son Alberto as capitano (1277–1302) was a time of incessant war against the counts of San Bonifacio, who were aided by the House of Este. Of his sons, Bartolomeo, Alboino and Cangrande I, only the last shared the government (1308); he was great as warrior, prince, and patron of the arts; he protected Dante, Petrarch, and Giotto. By war or treaty, he brought under his control the cities of Padua (1328), Treviso (1308) and Vicenza. At this time before the Black death the city was home to more than 40,000 people.\nCangrande was succeeded by Mastino II (1329–1351) and Alberto, sons of Alboino. Mastino continued his uncle's policy, conquering Brescia in 1332 and carrying his power beyond the Po. He purchased Parma (1335) and Lucca (1339). After the King of France, he was the richest prince of his time. But a powerful league was formed against him in 1337 – Florence, Venice, the Visconti, the Este, and the Gonzaga. After a three years war, the Scaliger dominions were reduced to Verona and Vicenza (Mastino's daughter Regina-Beatrice della Scala married to Barnabò Visconti). Mastino's son Cangrande II (1351–1359) was a cruel, dissolute, and suspicious tyrant; not trusting his own subjects, he surrounded himself with Brandenburg mercenaries. He was killed by his brother Cansignorio (1359–1375), who beautified the city with palaces, provided it with aqueducts and bridges, and founded the state treasury. He also killed his other brother, Paolo Alboino. Fratricide seems to have become a family custom, for Antonio (1375–1387), Cansignorio's natural brother, slew his brother Bartolomeo, thereby arousing the indignation of the people, who deserted him when Gian Galeazzo Visconti of Milan made war on him. Having exhausted all his resources, he fled from Verona at midnight (19 October 1387), thus putting an end to the Scaliger domination, which, however, survived in its monuments.\nThe year 1387 is also the year of the Battle of Castagnaro, between Giovanni Ordelaffi, for Verona, and John Hawkwood, for Padua, who was the winner.\nAntonio's son Canfrancesco attempted in vain to recover Verona (1390). Guglielmo (1404), natural son of Cangrande II, was more fortunate; with the support of the people and the Carraresi, he drove out the Milanese, but he died ten days after. After a period of Cararrese rule, Verona submitted to Venice (1405). The last representatives of the Scaligeri lived at the imperial court and repeatedly attempted to recover Verona by the aid of popular risings.\nFrom 1508 to 1517, the city was in the power of the Emperor Maximilian I. There were numerous outbreaks of the plague, and in 1629–1633, Italy was struck by its worst outbreak in modern times. Around 33,000 people died in Verona (over 60% of the population at the time) in 1630–1631.\nIn 1776, a method of bellringing was developed called Veronese bellringing art. Verona was occupied by Napoleon in 1797, but on Easter Monday the populace rose and drove out the French. It was then that Napoleon made an end of the Venetian Republic. Verona became Austrian territory when Napoleon signed the Treaty of Campo Formio in October 1797. The Austrians took control of the city on 18 January 1798. It was taken from Austria by the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 and became part of Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy, but was returned to Austria following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, when it became part of the Austrian-held Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia.\nThe Congress of Verona, which met on 20 October 1822, was part of the series of international conferences or congresses, opening with the Congress of Vienna in 1814–1815, that marked the continuing enforcement of the \"Concert of Europe\".\nIn 1866, following the Third Italian War of Independence, Verona, along with the rest of Venetia, became part of a united Italy.\nThe advent of fascism added another dark chapter to the annals of Verona. Throughout Italy, the Jewish population was hit by the Manifesto of Race, a series of anti-Semitic laws passed in 1938, and after the invasion by Nazi Germany in 1943, deportations to Nazi concentration camps. An Austrian Fort (now a church, the Santuario della Madonna di Lourdes), was used to incarcerate and torture Allied troops, Jews and anti-fascists, especially after 1943, when Verona became part of the Italian Social Republic.\nAs in Austrian times, Verona became of great strategic importance to the regime. Galeazzo Ciano, Benito Mussolini's son-in-law, was accused of plotting against the republic; in a show trial staged in January 1944 by the Nazi and fascist hierarchy at Castelvecchio (the Verona trial), Ciano was executed on the banks of the Adige with many other officers on what is today Via Colombo. This marked another turning point in the escalation of violence that would only end with the final liberation by allied troops and partisans on 26 April 1945.\nAfter World War II, as Italy joined the NATO alliance, Verona once again acquired its strategic importance, due to its geographical closeness to the Iron Curtain. The city became the seat of SETAF (South European Allied Terrestrial Forces) and had during the whole duration of the Cold War period a strong military presence, especially American, which has since decreased.\n## Geography\n### Climate\nVerona has a humid subtropical climate characteristic of Northern Italy's inland plains, with hot summers and cold, humid winters, even though Lake Garda has a partial influence on the city. The relative humidity is high throughout the year, especially in winter when it causes fog, mainly from dusk until late morning, although the phenomenon has become less and less frequent in recent years.\n## Demographics\nIn 2009, 265,368 people were residing in Verona, located in the province of Verona, Veneto, of whom 47.6% were male and 52.4% were female. Minors (children aged 0–17) totaled 16.05% of the population compared to pensioners who number 22.36%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of Verona residents is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Verona grew by 3.05%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85%. The current birth rate of Verona is 9.24 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.\nAs of 2009, 87% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant group comes from other European nations (the largest coming from Romania): 3.60%, South Asia: 2.03%, and sub-saharan Africa 1.50%. The city is predominantly Roman Catholic, but due to immigration now has some Orthodox Christian, and Muslim followers.\n## Government\nSince the local government political reorganization in 1993, Verona has been governed by the City Council of Verona, which is based in Palazzo Barbieri. Voters elect directly 33 councilors and the Mayor of Verona every five years.\nVerona is also the capital of its own province. The Provincial Council is seated in Palazzo del Governo. The current Mayor of Verona is Damiano Tommasi, elected on 26 June 2022.\nVerona has traditionally been a right-wing traditionalist Catholic city, reflecting its former status as one of the major cities of Italian Social Republic, and the right-wing politics of the Veneto region. In October 2018, Verona became the first city in Italy to declare itself pro-life, and hosted the American Christian right lobby group World Congress of Families' conference in 2019. Despite this, since the mayors became directly elected in 1994, the city has elected two left-wing mayors - Paolo Zanotto in 2002 and current mayor Damiano Tommasi in 2022, largely due to incumbent mayor Federico Sboarina's refusal to include center-right parties in his right-wing coalition.\n## Main sights\nBecause of the value and importance of its many historical buildings, Verona has been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Verona preserved many ancient Roman monuments (including the magnificent Arena) in the early Middle Ages, but many of its early medieval edifices were destroyed or heavily damaged by the earthquake of 3 January 1117, which led to a massive Romanesque rebuilding. The Carolingian period Versus de Verona contains an important description of Verona in the early medieval era.\n### Roman edifices\nThe Roman military settlement in what is now the center of the city was to expand through the cardines and decumani that intersect at right angles. This structure has been kept to the present day and is clearly visible from the air. Further development has not reshaped the original map. Though the Roman city with its basalt-paved roads is mostly hidden from view it stands virtually intact about 6 m below the surface. Most palazzi and houses have cellars built on Roman structures that are rarely accessible to visitors.\nPiazza delle Erbe, near the Roman forum was rebuilt by Cangrande I and Cansignorio della Scala I, lords of Verona, using material (such as marble blocks and statues) from Roman spas and villas.\nVerona is famous for its Roman amphitheater, the Arena, found in the city's largest piazza, the Piazza Bra. Completed around 30 AD, it is the third-largest in Italy after Rome's Colosseum and the arena at Capua. It measures 139 meters long and 110 meters wide, and could seat some 25,000 spectators in its 44 tiers of marble seats. The ludi (shows and gladiator games) performed within its walls were so famous that they attracted spectators from far beyond the city. The current two-story façade is actually the internal support for the tiers; only a fragment of the original outer perimeter wall in white and pink limestone from Valpolicella, with three stories remains. The interior is very impressive and is virtually intact, and has remained in use even today for public events, fairs, theatre, and open-aired opera during warm summer nights.\nThere is also a variety of other Roman monuments to be found in the town, such as the Roman theatre of Verona. This theatre was built in the 1st century BC, but through the ages had fallen in disuse and had been built upon to provide housing. In the 18th century Andrea Monga, a wealthy Veronese, bought all the houses that in time had been built over the theatre, demolished them, and saved the monument. Not far from it is the Ponte di Pietra (\"Stone Wall Bridge\"), another Roman landmark that has survived to this day.\nThe Arco dei Gavi (Gavi Arch) was built in the 1st century AD and is famous for having the name of the builder (architect Lucius Vitruvius Cordone) engraved on it, a rare case in the architecture of the epoque. It originally straddled the main Roman road into the city, now the Corso Cavour. It was demolished by French troops in 1805 and rebuilt in 1932.\nNearby is the Porta Borsari, an archway at the end of Corso Porta Borsari. This is the façade of a 3rd-century gate in the original Roman city walls. The inscription is dated 245 AD and gives the city name as Colonia Verona Augusta. Corso Porta Borsari, the road passing through the gate is the original Via Sacra of the Roman city. Today, it is lined with several Renaissance palazzi and the ancient Church of Santi Apostoli, a few meters from Piazza delle Erbe.\nPorta Leoni is the 1st century BC ruin of what was once part of the Roman city gate. A substantial portion is still standing as part of the wall of a medieval building. The street itself is an open archaeological site, and the remains of the original Roman street and gateway foundations can be seen a few feet below the present street level. As can be seen from there, the gate contains a small court guarded by towers. Here, carriages and travelers were inspected before entering or leaving the city.\nSanto Stefano church is dedicated to the first Christian martyr, was erected in the Paleochristian era, and houses the burials of the first bishops of Verona. Throughout the centuries Saint Stephen underwent complex architectural transformations. Particularly striking is the rare two-story ambulatory, probably built to give pilgrims visual access to the abundant collection of important relics for which the church was famous. Also to be visited is the cruciform crypt with its forest of columns, arches, and cross vaults. Saint Stephen was the first Christian martyr and, according to the Acts of the Apostles, was stoned just outside Jerusalem, in a place still remembered today, near the so-called \"Porta Leoni\".\n### Medieval architecture\nThe Basilica of San Zeno Maggiore is a Romanesque style church, the third such structure on its site, built from 1123–1135, over the 4th-century shrine to Verona's patron saint, St. Zeno (bishop of Verona from 362 to 380 when he died). The façade dominates the large square, and is flanked with a 72-meter-tall bell tower, which is mentioned by Dante in Canto 18 of Purgatory in the Divine Comedy. The weathered Veronese stone gives a warm golden glow, and the restrained lines of the pillars, columns, and cornices, and the gallery with its double windows, give the façade an air of harmonious elegance. The huge rose window is decorated as a Wheel of Fortune. The lintels above the portal have carvings of the months of the year. Each side of the doorway is embellished with 18 bas-relief panels of biblical scenes, and the inner bronze door panels have 48 primitive but forceful depictions of Biblical scenes and episodes from the life of St Zeno. The meaning of some of the scenes is now unknown, but the extraordinarily vivid energy of the figures is a superb blend of traditional and Ottonian influences. The interior of the church is divided into the Lower Church, occupying about ⅔ of the structure, and the Upper Church, occupying the remainder. The walls are covered with 12th and 14th century frescos and the ceiling of the nave is a magnificent example of a ship's keel ceiling. The vaulted crypt contains the tomb of St. Zeno, the first Bishop of Verona, as well as the tombs of several other saints. North of the church is a pleasant cloister. The church also houses the tomb of King Pippin of Italy (777–810). The Basilica of San Lorenzo is another Romanesque church, albeit smaller. It dates from around 1177, but was built on the site of a Paleochristian church, fragments of which remain. The church is built of alternating tracks of brick and stone, and has two cylindrical towers, housing spiral staircases to the women's galleries. The interior is sober but still quiet. The striped bands of stone and brick and the graceful arches complement the setting. Santa Maria Antica is a small Romanesque church that served as the private chapel of the Scaligeri clan, and is famous for the Gothic Scaliger Tombs. The Duomo is also a notable Romanesque church. Sant'Anastasia is a huge and lofty church built from 1290–1481 by the Dominicans to hold the massive congregations attracted by their sermons. The Pellegrini chapel houses the fresco St. George and the Princess of Trebizond by Pisanello as well as the grave of Wilhelm von Bibra. An art festival is held in the square each may.\nWith a span length of 48.70 m (159.78 ft), the segmental arch bridge Ponte Scaligero featured, at the time of its completion in 1356, the world's largest bridge arch.\n## Notable people\nAleardo Aleardi, a poet Berto Barbarani, poet Paolo Bellasio, composer of the Renaissance; member of the Roman School Stefano Bernardi, baroque composer Massimo Bubola, singer-songwriter born in Terrazzo Paolo Caliari, well known as \"Veronese\", painter Lou Campi, professional bowler Mario Capecchi, Nobel prize in Medicine, 2007 Giovanni Francesco Caroto, painter Catullus, Latin poet Walter Chiari, actor Gigliola Cinquetti, a singer who brought Italy its first Eurovision Song Contest win in 1964 Lorenzo Comendich, painter Damiano Cunego, former world number 1 cyclist and former Giro d'Italia winner Giorgio de Stefani, tennis player, finalist at the 1932 French Open Franco Donatoni, composer Gino Fano, mathematician Girolamo Fracastoro, also known as Fracastorius, renowned scholar, physician, and poet Giovanni Giocondo, architect and scholar Girolamo dai Libri, illuminator of manuscripts and painter Romano Guardini, theologian Claudio Guglielmoni, retired professional football player Marc' Antonio Ingegneri, composer, teacher of Claudio Monteverdi Ernestine von Kirchsberg, Austrian landscape painter Cesare Lombroso, criminologist Scipione Maffei, writer and historian Matteo Manassero, British amateur golf champion, 2009 Arnoldo Mondadori, editor Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, fictional characters from the well known Shakespearian play Romeo and Juliet Marcantonio Negri, Baroque composer, associate of Monteverdi Carlo Pedrotti, 19th-century composer, conductor, voice teacher, and opera administrator St. Peter Martyr, Dominican preacher and saint Ippolito Pindemonte, poet Ratherius, Medieval bishop and writer Francesca Rettondini, actress Carlo Rovelli, physicist and writer Vincenzo Ruffo, composer of the Renaissance Emilio Salgari, novelist Antonio Salieri, composer Michele Sammicheli, architect Sara Simeoni, the former world high jump primatist and Olympic gold medalist Marco Stroppa, composer Bartolomeo Tromboncino, composer of the Renaissance period Giorgio Zancanaro, baritone Achille Lauro, singer, rapper, and songwriter who will represent San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2022\nVerona was the birthplace of Catullus, and the town that Julius Caesar chose for relaxing stays. It has had an association with many important people and events that have been significant in the history of Europe, such as Theoderic the Great, king of Ostrogoths, Alboin and Rosamund, the Lombard Dukes, Charlemagne and Pippin of Italy, Berengar I, and Dante. Conclaves were held here, as were important congresses. Verona featured in the travel diaries of Goethe, Stendhal, Paul Valéry and Michel de Montaigne. The British writer Tim Parks has been living near Verona since the 1980s and the city is central to many of his books, notably A Season with Verona and Italian Neighbors.\n## Sport\nThe city has two professional football teams nowadays. Historically, the city's major team has been Hellas Verona. They won the Italian Serie A championship in 1984–85 and played in the European Cup the following year. Chievo Verona represented Chievo, a suburb of Verona, and were created in 1929. However, they ceased to exist in 2021 due to outstanding tax payments. As of the 2021–22 season, Hellas plays in the first division of Italian football, Serie A, while Virtus Verona, the other club in the city, plays in the Serie C. The teams of Hellas and Chievo contested the Derby della Scala and shared the 38,402-seater Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi (now only home to Hellas due to the fold of Chievo), which was used as a venue at the 1990 FIFA World Cup.\nVerona is home to the volleyball team Marmi Lanza Verona (now in Serie A1), the rugby team Franklin and Marshall Cus Verona Rugby (now in Serie A1), and the basketball team Scaligera Basket (now in Legadue).\nThe city has twice hosted the UCI Road World Championships, in 1999 (with Treviso as co-host) and in 2004. The city also regularly hosts stages of the Giro d'Italia annual cycling race. Verona also hosted the baseball world cup in 2009, and the Volleyball World Cup in September–October 2010. Verona is hosting the Volleyball Women's World Championship in September–October 2014.\n## Infrastructure and transport\n### Public transit\nPublic transit has been operated by the provincial public transport company, Azienda Trasporti Verona (ATV), since 2007. From 1884 to 1951, the city was served by the Verona tram network . Trolleybuses replaced the trams which were themselves replaced by buses in 1975. A new trolleybus network is currently under review by ATV and is expected to open in 2022.\nAn incline lift, the Verona funicular, opened in 2017 and provides access from the Ponte Pietra to the Roman theatre museum and San Pietro Castle.\n### Railways\nVerona lies at a major route crossing where the north-south rail line from the Brenner Pass to Rome intersects with the east-west line between Milan and Venice, giving the city rail access to most of Europe. In addition to regional and local services, the city is served by direct international trains to Zurich, Innsbruck, and Munich and by overnight sleeper services to Paris and Dijon (Thello), Munich, and Vienna (ÖBB).\nVerona's main station is Verona Porta Nuova railway station, to the south of the city center. It is considered to be the ninth busiest railway station in Italy, handling approximately 68,000 passengers per day, or 25 million passengers per year.\nThere is a lesser station to the east of the city at Porta Vescovo, which used to be the main station in Verona, but now only receives trains between Venice and Porta Nuova.\n### Airport\nVerona Airport is located 10 km (6.2 mi) southwest of Verona. It handles around 3 million passengers per year. It is linked to Porta Nuova railway station by a frequent bus service.\nThere are direct flights between Verona and Rome Fiumicino, Munich, Berlin, Moscow, Naples, Frankfurt, Catania, London Gatwick, Dublin, Palermo, Cork, Manchester, Liverpool and Cagliari among others.\n## International relations\n### Twin towns – sister cities\nVerona is twinned with:\n### Friendship pacts\nVerona has friendly relations with:\n## In popular culture\nTwo of William Shakespeare's plays, the famous Romeo and Juliet, as well as the lesser-known The Two Gentlemen of Verona, are set in the city of Verona.

{"name": "Kryezezi", "documents": ["# Kryezezi\nThe Kryezezi are a historical Albanian tribe (fis) and tribal region in the districts of Lezha and Mirdita of northern Albania. It is one of the four traditional bajraks of the Highlands of Lezha (Malësia e Lezhës), alongside the Bulgëri, Vela and Manatia.\n## Geography\nKryezezi tribal territory is located on the northern side of the Fan river, particularly where the Greater and Lesser Fan rivers unite down to about Rubik. It is bordered by the Manatia tribal region to the west, the Vela tribal region to the north, the Dibrri tribal region of Mirdita to the east and the Bulgëri tribal territory to the south. Their main settlements include Rubik, Munaz, Vau i Shkjezës, and the now abandoned Kryezez.\n## Etymology\nThe term Kryezezi translates to 'black head'.\n## History\nThe Kryezezi are the first, primary Bajrak of the Lezha Highlands, and were also known as Kryezezi Krypaxhi (meaning Kryezezi Salters) probably because of their proximity to the sea and therefore their role as salt suppliers to the other Bajraks of Mirdita and the Lezha Highlands. They joined the Mirdita tribe in 1818 along with the rest of the tribes of the Highlands of Lezha. The tribal toponym first appears shortly after 1640 as Crosesi and appears in 1866 as Criesesi, where it was estimated to have 60 households at this time. In 1905, Karl Steinmetz estimated the Kryezezi to have 120 households, and described them as a destitute yet peace-loving tribe. They did not plunder the lowlands like their neighbours, and no murders had been committed on Kryezezi territory for years. Edith Durham, who visited Kryezezi territory in the summer of 1908, was refused hospitality by a foreign, non-Albanian Franciscan friar at the church of Rubik, much to the dismay of the local Albanians of the Kryezezi tribe who were outraged by the act. In 1918, the Kryezezi had 138 households with 879 inhabitants.\n## Religion\nThe Kryezezi are a Catholic tribe, just like all tribes in Mirdita and the Lezha Highlands. There was a monastery in Rubik that sat upon a cliff overlooking the Fan river that had been founded by the Benedictines. The Church of the Holy Savour, which was the only remaining part of the monastery, was taken over by Franciscans and restored in 1782 and 1837."], "selected_questions": ["What is the geographic location of the Kryezezi tribal territory?", "Which tribes border the Kryezezi tribal region?", "Which religion is followed by the Kryezezi tribe?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The Kryezezi tribal territory is located on the northern side of the Fan river, particularly where the Greater and Lesser Fan rivers unite down to about Rubik.

(Melinda White was a daughter of Knoxville's founder, James White.) The home is designed in the Federal style, with a noteworthy pediment with a fanlight at the roofline.\nCol. Williams was originally from Surry County, North Carolina. He was the fourth son of Colonel Joseph and Rebekah Lanier Williams. He served as Tennessee's Attorney General from 1807 to 1808, was a U.S. Senator representing Tennessee from 1815 to 1823 and was the hero of the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814 (Jackson's first military victory.) His Senate career ended in 1823, when General Andrew Jackson won the seat. Colonel Williams also served as a trustee of East Tennessee College (now the University of Tennessee). Colonel Williams died in 1837, and Melinda died eight months later. Both are buried in the First Presbyterian Church Cemetery.\nThe house and property were sold to Abner Jackson, co-owner of A.G. Jackson & Company, a dry goods store, in 1855. He owned the house until his death in 1869. Beginning in 1883 it was leased to the state of Tennessee for use as the Colored Deaf and Dumb School.

In the latter it was turned into classrooms for students and was last used in approximately 1982. For many years it was vacant while adjoining buildings were used for the Sertoma Learning Center.\nAfter asbestos was found in those other buildings, Sertoma moved to other quarters and the state abandoned the property in 1991. The property was purchased by descendants of the former owners in 1998 and has been restored. The house and some of the original acreage is still owned by the descendants.

{"name": "County of Osona", "documents": ["# County of Osona\nThe County of Osona, also Ausona (Catalan: Comtat d'Osona, IPA: ; Latin: Comitatus Ausonae), was one of the Catalan counties of the Marca Hispanica in the Early and High Middle Ages. It was based around the capital city of Vic (Vicus) and the corresponding diocese, whose territory was roughly the current comarca of Osona.\nThe ancient diocese of Osona was sacked by the Arabs in the mid eighth century (c. 750–755). Its reconquest by Christian powers began in 798; in that year Louis of Aquitaine ordered a Goth Borrell to enter the abandoned region and repair the castles of Vic, Cardona, and Casserès. Vic was in Frankish hands by 799. After the successful siege of Barcelona in 801, Borrell, already Count of Cerdanya and Urgell, received Osona as a countship from his liege lord, King Louis. On Borrell's death, Osona was granted to the Frankish Count of Barcelona, Rampon. After the rebellion of 826, during which Guillemó and Aissó succeeded in taking it with help from the Emirate of Córdoba, Osona remained depopulated and outside of Frankish control until 879. It was considered to be part of the County of Barcelona throughout that period.\nIn 879, Wilfred the Hairy began the repopulation of the county with free minores, who cultivated the lands given them as aprisiones; they turned Osona into a central and important part of Catalonia. There was a viscounty of Osona from 900. The viscounts controlled the region on behalf of the counts, who were usually resident in Barcelona. The viscountship later changed its name to viscounty of Cabrera. Wilfred, who established the viscounty, also built new castles along the frontier of Osona, at Torelló (881), Montgrony (887), and Tarabaldi (892). All these fortresses were controlled either directly by the count or by a castellan who also controlled the appendici or surrounding territory on certain specific terms. The castle, in fact, and its mandamenta (commandment) were the central organising feature of Osona after its repopulation. Wilfred also reorganised the church in Osona — after the bishopric, Wilfred's foundation of the convent of Sant Joan de les Abadesses, originally under his daughter Emma, was the most important ecclesiastical institution in the county — and introduced serfdom on a limited scale.\nThroughout the tenth century, Osona remained tied to Barcelona, except for the brief rule of Ermengol from 939 to 943. In 990, the small pagus of Berga was detached from it and granted to Cerdanya. In 1035, Osona was detached from Barcelona for another brief period when Berenguer Ramon I left it to his widow, Guisla de Lluça, on his death. She ruled it with her son William until she remarried and he renounced it. After that, it was reattached to Barcelona, but was augmented by the addition of the County of Manresa, which was subsumed within Osona and ceased to be a distinct polity in the region..\nRamon Berenguer III ceded the county to his son-in-law Bernard III of Besalú, as dowry of his daughter Jimena in 1107. When both Jimena and Bernard died without heirs, Osona returned to Barcelona. This was to be the end for Osona as a nominally distinct county; the use of the terms \"county\" and \"count\" of Osona disappeared subsequently. From that point, its history was linked to the Principality of Catalonia. The title was revived for the Cabrera family in 1356 and it passed to the House of Montcada in 1574 and the Medinaceli in 1722, but none of these families ever controlled the feudal region.\n## List of counts\nBorrell 798–820 Rampon 820–825 Bernard 825–826 Aisso 826–827 Guillemó 826–827 to the Counts of Barcelona 827–939 Ermengol 939–943 to the Counts of Barcelona 943–1035 Guisla de Lluça 1035–1054 William 1035–1054 to the Counts of Barcelona 1054–1107 Jimena 1107–1149 Bernard 1107–1111 Bernard III of Cabrera 1356–1364 to the Counts of Barcelona permanently\n## Sources\nLewis, Archibald Ross.

{"name": "Behavioral Analysis Unit", "documents": ["# Behavioral Analysis Unit\nThe Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) is a department of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (NCAVC) that uses behavioral analysts to assist in criminal investigations. The mission of the NCAVC and the BAU is to provide behavioral based investigative and/or operational support by applying case experience, research, and training to complex and time-sensitive crimes, typically involving acts or threats of violence.\n## History and structure\nThe Behavioral Analysis Unit originates from the Behavioral Science Unit, established in 1985 and now renamed Behavioral Analysis Unit 5, which is the unit devoted to research. The Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) was created in 1985 as part of the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (NCAVC), itself established in 1985.\nThe IOSS (Investigations & Operations Support Section) is a branch of the FBI's overall CIRG Critical Incident Response Group. IOSS provides personnel and training to assist in investigations throughout the country, and at US embassies worldwide. IOSS supports other CIRG groups within the FBI, FBI Headquarters and Field Offices, FBI legal attaches (at embassies abroad), and all US law enforcement agencies. IOSS is divided into two main sections: the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (NCAVC) and the Operations Support Branch (OSB).\nThe NCAVC consists of five Behavioral Analysis Units, or \"BAU\"s:\nBehavioral Analysis Unit 1 (counterterrorism, arson and bombing matters) Behavioral Analysis Unit 2 (threats, cyber crime, and public corruption) Behavioral Analysis Unit 3 (crimes against children) Behavioral Analysis Unit 4 (crimes against adults, ViCAP) Behavioral Analysis Unit 5 (research, strategy, and instruction)\nThe headquarters for the BAU is located in Quantico, Virginia.\nThe NCAVC also includes the ViCAP. ViCAP (Violent Criminal Apprehension Program) is a database available as a tool to all law enforcement agencies nationwide. It compiles facts, statistics, and particular details regarding violent offenses (including rape, assault, and murder), and maintains them in an online database for the purpose of linking a known offender or known offense to previous crimes, victims, or offenders. It is a pattern database, allowing users to see patterns in M.O., signature, or victimology, helping to tie crimes to offenders and offenders to crimes for the purpose of solving cases involving violence.\nThe Operations Support Branch (OSB) contains three main units:\nCrisis Management Unit Special Events Management Unit Rapid Deployment & Technology Unit\n## Operation\nThe BAU receives requests for services from federal, state, local, and international law enforcement agencies. Responses to these requests for BAU assistance are facilitated through the network of field NCAVC coordinators. BAU services can consist of on-site case consultations, telephone conference calls, and/or consultations held at the BAU with case investigators.\nBAU assistance to law enforcement agencies is provided through the process of \"criminal investigative analysis\". Criminal investigative analysis is a process of reviewing crimes from both a behavioral and investigative perspective. It involves reviewing and assessing the facts of a criminal act, interpreting offender behavior, and interaction with the victim, as exhibited during the commission of the crime, or as displayed in the crime scene. BAU staff conduct detailed analyses of crimes for the purpose of providing two or more of the following services: crime analysis, investigative suggestions, profiles of unknown offenders, threat analysis, critical incident analysis, interview strategies, major case management, search warrant assistance, prosecutive and trial strategies, and expert testimony. In addition to the above services, the BAU staff produced the Child Abduction Response Plan to assist investigators faced with these investigations. Recently, the BAU released \"The School Shooter: A Threat Assessment Perspective\" report to guide school administrators, teachers, parents, and law enforcement in identifying and evaluating threats in schools. The BAU maintains a reference file for experts in various forensic disciplines such as odontology, anthropology, psychiatry, entomology, or pathology.\n## References in popular culture\nThe BAU was brought into mainstream culture by television shows such as Criminal Minds, which depict an elite group of \"FBI agent profilers\" who travel the country assisting local law enforcement on diverse cases.\nThe CBS weekly drama series Criminal Minds and its spinoff, Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior both feature the BAU. Thomas Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels and the corresponding films (Manhunter, The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, and Red Dragon) featured the Behavioral Science Unit (BSU), which later created and developed what eventually became known as the BAU. It is also seen in the NBC television show based on the novels, Hannibal, and the CBS television show Clarice. The Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode \"Signature\" (season 9, no. 12, January 8, 2008) heavily features a member of the BAU. Additionally, in season 5 of the HBO show The Wire, two detectives visit the BAU team in Quantico for a profile of the \"fake\" serial killer they are investigating. In October 2017, the Netflix show Mindhunter was released, which details the experiences of two BSU team detectives interviewing inmates with psychological disorders. In August 2017, the Discovery Channel series Manhunt: Unabomber, based on true events, was released. It featured a member of the BAU who helped catch Ted Kaczynski AKA the Unabomber, through the use of forensic profiling.\n## Criticism\nIn order to generate profiles of offenders, members of the BAU use a concept known as psychological profiling. Belief in psychological profiling has often been supported by anecdotal evidence describing BAU profiles as a necessary key to solving a crime. A homeless man in North Carolina, for example, was apprehended after a BAU profile was issued for a case that the local police force had not been able to solve. Although anecdotal evidence such as this abounds in popular media, the concept of psychological profiling has not been empirically proven.\nIn a number of studies, professional criminal profilers have been compared to other groups such as students, police officers, and clinical psychologists. In order to evaluate these groups, each participant was presented with the details of a previously solved crime. The profile written by the participant was then compared to a profile of the guilty party. In no study did the group of profilers outperform the other groups, and in some studies, they were clearly outperformed by both police officers and chemistry students.\nDespite these findings, members of the BAU continue to use psychological profiling. Public confidence in psychological profiling is also high and has been greatly promoted by TV shows such as Criminal Minds. Some forensic psychologists, such as Robert Homant, have also dismissed the previously mentioned studies by stating that they lack external validity as they do not truly represent the situations in which members of the BAU work."], "selected_questions": ["What is the mission of the NCAVC and the BAU?", "What is the purpose of the ViCAP database?", "What is criminal investigative analysis?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The mission of the NCAVC and the BAU is to provide behavioral based investigative and/or operational support by applying case experience, research, and training to complex and time-sensitive crimes, typically involving acts or threats of violence.", "The purpose of the ViCAP (Violent Criminal Apprehension Program) database is to compile facts, statistics, and specific details regarding violent offenses such as rape, assault, and murder.

The site currently consists of two large two-storey buildings as well as a few small cabins, including the \"Kings Feast\" which is used to sell food at breaks, lunches and special occasions. The others are used as classrooms or form rooms similar to the rooms inside the other buildings.\n## History\nOpened in 1605, by King James I of England it went through multiple transformations and renaming. It was mainly known as King James 1st Grammar School and became the first secondary school in south-west Durham to be upgraded to academy status.\nIn an interview, Elizabeth Varley (Chair Of Governors For The Academy and former student) described how many years ago, students had to pass a test to be able to attend the academy since at the time it was a Grammar School where boys and girls were educated separately. She also revealed that the current Art block was not part of the original Middle School building, and that it was added at a later date to house a school swimming pool (which has since been blocked up).\nIn 2022 there were 944 students in the academy, with 136 of them being sixth formers.

Leaders’ high expectations of pupils are set out in the school’s '7 Standards'. These include values such as ‘be prepared’ and ‘engage and succeed’. Pupils understand the importance of these expectations. They enjoy coming to school. Pupils conduct themselves well in lessons and make visitors feel welcome. Pupils feel safe. They value the help that they can get from the student support team. Pupils who are less confident speaking to staff can ask for help by email or put a message in the letterboxes around the school. Most pupils told us that when bullying occurs, it is handled well by staff. Students in the sixth form enjoy a wide range of academic and vocational courses.

{"name": "Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site", "documents": ["# Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site\nHubbell Trading Post National Historic Site is a historic site on Highway 191, north of Chambers, with an exhibit center in Ganado, Arizona. It is considered a meeting ground of two cultures between the Navajo and the settlers who came to the area to trade.\n## History\nIn 1878, John Lorenzo Hubbell purchased this trading post, ten years after Navajos were allowed to return to the Ganado region from their U.S.-imposed exile in Bosque Redondo, Fort Sumner, New Mexico. This ended what is known in Navajo history as the \"Long Walk of the Navajo.\"\nIt was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960.\n## Navajo people\nWhen the Navajos returned from The Long Walk in 1868, they found their herds decimated, their fields destroyed. Their way of life was ripped apart and their life was forever changed. The Navajos were troubled by an economic depression in the late 19th century as a result of the Long Walk. Thus, trade became increasingly important.\nHeavy sandstones from the area were quarried in 1883 to begin construction of this solid building along the southern banks of the Pueblo Colorado Wash. Life at Hubbell Trading Post centered around it. The idea of trading was not new to the Navajos. Native American tribes in the Southwest had traded amongst themselves for centuries. During the four years' internment at Bosque Redondo, Navajos were introduced to many new items (e.g., flour, sugar, coffee, baking powder, canned goods, tobacco, tools, cloth, etc.). When the Anglos came to trade with the Navajos, the difference was in the products exchanged, and in the changes brought about by these exchanges. Traders like Hubbell supplied these items.\nTrade with men like Hubbell became increasingly important for the Navajos. The trader was in contact with the world outside the newly created reservation; a world which could supply the staples the Navajos needed to supplement their homegrown products. In exchange for the trader's goods the Navajos traded wool, sheep and, later, rugs, jewelry, baskets and pottery. It was years before cash was used between trader and Navajos.\nHubbell family members operated this trading post until it was sold to the National Park Service in 1967. The trading post is still active, operated by the non-profit Western National Parks Association, which maintains the trading traditions the Hubbell family established.\nToday, Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site is still situated on the original 160-acre (65 ha) homestead, which includes the trading post, family home, out buildings, land and a visitor center. Visitors can experience this historic trading post on the Navajo Nation, which includes weaving demonstrations; and the store still maintains a wooden floor and walls from the days of old. A set of initials carved on the gate of the privacy wall which separates the public spaces from the private stand for John Lorenzo Hubbell.\n## Hubbell's life\nHubbell's father was Anglo, his mother Spanish. He was raised in Pajarito Mesa, New Mexico, a small village just south of Albuquerque, New Mexico. He came to this area in 1876, less than ten years after the Long Walk. In 1878 he bought the small buildings comprising the compound from a trader named William Leonard, and started business. He was twenty-three years old, single and trying to make a living among the Navajos, a people he did not know very well. He had to find a niche in a new culture, a difficult language. He probably learned \"trader Navajo\" very quickly. John Lorenzo was trilingual. He spoke English, Spanish and Navajo.\nMr. Hubbell married a Spanish woman named Lina Rubi. They had two sons and two daughters. Additions to the family home to accommodate the growing family were finished in 1902. It started out as a plain adobe building which the Hubbell family gradually made into a comfortable, and in some ways, luxurious home. Paintings and artifacts and many large Navajo rugs still decorate the interior. Unlike other traders who left their families \"back home\" in the east, the entire Hubbell family spent most of the year in the village of Ganado. The Hubbells lived in the house until 1967.\nThe guest house was built in the early 1930s by Roman and Dorothy Hubbell, Mr. Hubbell's son and daughter-in-law, as a tribute to Mr. Hubbell. Dorothy Hubbell carved the inner wooden door. Visitors stayed in the Hubbell home, such as artists who were interested in the color and shapes of the land; anthropologists who came to Mr. Hubbell for information; statesmen; friends of the family; and ordinary travelers in need of a place to stay. Architecturally, the guest house is in the Hogan (pronounced hoe-gone) (Navajo for home) style. Most hogans are built of logs, and the door always faces the east. Hogans are one-room dwellings and usually have six or eight sides. Mr. Hubbell built several traditional hogans on the grounds for the Navajos who came long distances to trade. The guest house was originally called Pueblo Colorado (the inscription over the door) but often was confused with the town of Pueblo, Colorado. There was an important Navajo leader named totsohnii Hastiin (pronounced Toe-so-knee haaus-teen) (Navajo for \"man of the big water clan\"). He was also called Ganado Mucho (pronounced gah-nah-doe-moo-cho) (Spanish for \"many cattle\") and Mr. Hubbell renamed this place Ganado for him. Ganado Mucho had a son, Many Horses, who is buried on the property.\nBeyond the perimeter wall to the north courses the Pueblo Colorado Wash, the northern boundary of the Hubbell settlement. In some sections of the Ganado-Cornfields valley, the wash is spring-fed and runs year round. Melting snows in spring and heavy summer rains sometimes cause it to flood. In the Southwest a good source of water has always attracted people. The Anasazi (pronounced ah-nuh-saa-zee) (Navajo for \"the ancient ones\") lived in small villages up and down the valley hundreds of years ago. The Navajos came later, and then the traders - all attracted to the source of water.\nThe cone-shaped hill located northwest of the trading post is Hubbell Hill. The family cemetery is at the top. Mr. Hubbell, his wife, three of his children, a daughter-in-law, a granddaughter, and a Navajo man named Many Horses are buried there. Many Horses was one of the local herdsmen and the son of Ganado Mucho. He and Mr. Hubbell were close friends for many years. Mr. Hubbell maintained a friendship with many of his customers until his death in 1930. Then his younger son Roman operated the business. When Roman died in 1957, his wife Dorothy managed the store for another ten years, until 1967 when the National Park Service acquired the site.\nBuilt with juniper logs upright in the ground, the corrals of the trading post held lambs and sheep purchased from Navajo stockmen by Mr. Hubbell. The flocks stayed in the corral complex until they could be herded to the railroad. From time to time Mr. Hubbell kept beef cattle as well. Mr. Hubbell homesteaded 160 acres (0.6 km2) before they were part of the reservation and territory. When the reservation expanded, it surrounded the Hubbell property. Through an act of Congress Mr. Hubbell got permission to keep his home. Freight wagons brought supplies fifty-six miles to the store from the little railroad town of Gallup, New Mexico, two to four days' travel in good weather. Going back to Gallup, freight wagons hauled huge sacks of wool.\n## Construction\nConstruction of the trading post barn began in 1897. The builders, local people, made the walls of local sandstone and the roofs fashioned in the ancient Anasazi-style dwellings. Ponderosa pine beams, aspen poles, juniper bark, cornstalks, and dirt make up layers, each at right angles to the one below it. Mules and pulleys lifted the beams into place. The timbers came from about twelve miles (19 km) east of Ganado Village where it is high enough for Ponderosa to grow. The aspen poles came from farther away in the Chuska Mountains that straddle the Arizona/New Mexico state line one hundred miles north to the intersection with Colorado and Utah.

{"name": "History of Los Angeles", "documents": ["# History of Los Angeles\nThe history of Los Angeles began in 1781 when 44 settlers from New Spain established a permanent settlement in what is now Downtown Los Angeles, as instructed by Spanish Governor of Las Californias, Felipe de Neve, and authorized by Viceroy Antonio María de Bucareli. After sovereignty changed from Mexico to the United States in 1848, great changes came from the completion of the Santa Fe railroad line from Chicago to Los Angeles in 1885. \"Overlanders\" flooded in, mostly white Protestants from the Lower Midwest and South.\nLos Angeles had a strong economic base in farming, oil, tourism, real estate and movies. It grew rapidly with many suburban areas inside and outside the city limits. Its motion picture industry made the city world-famous, and World War II brought new industry, especially high-tech aircraft construction. Politically the city was moderately conservative, with a weak labor union sector.\nSince the 1960s, growth has slowed—and traffic delays have become infamous. Los Angeles was a pioneer in freeway development as the public transit system deteriorated. New arrivals, especially from Mexico and Asia, have transformed the demographic base since the 1960s. Old industries have declined, including farming, oil, military and aircraft, but tourism, entertainment and high-tech remain strong. Over time, droughts and wildfires have increased in frequency and become less seasonal and more year-round, further straining the city's water security.\n## Early times\nBy 3000 BCE, the area was occupied by the Hokan-speaking people of the Milling Stone Period who fished, hunted sea mammals, and gathered wild seeds. They were later replaced by migrants — possibly fleeing drought in the Great Basin — who spoke a Uto-Aztecan language called Tongva. The Tongva people called the Los Angeles region Yaa in that tongue.\nBy the 1700s CE, there were 250,000 to 300,000 native people in California and 5,000 in the Los Angeles basin. The land occupied and used by the Tongva covered about 4,000 square miles (10,000 km2). It included the enormous floodplain drained by the Los Angeles and San Gabriel rivers and the southern Channel Islands, including the Santa Barbara, San Clemente, Santa Catalina, and San Nicolas Islands. They were part of a sophisticated group of trading partners that included the Chumash to the west, the Cahuilla and Mojave to the east, and the Juaneños and Luiseños to the south. Their trade extended to the Colorado River and included slavery.\nThe lives of the Tongva were governed by a set of religious and cultural practices that included belief in creative supernatural forces. They worshipped Chinigchinix, a creator god, and Chukit, a female virgin god. Their Great Morning Ceremony was based on a belief in the afterlife. In a purification ritual, they drank tolguache, a hallucinogenic made from jimson weed and salt water. Their language was called Kizh or Kij, and they practiced cremation.\nGenerations before the arrival of the Europeans, the Tongva had identified and lived in the best sites for human occupation. The survival and success of Los Angeles depended greatly on the presence of a nearby and prosperous Tongva village called Yaanga, which was located by the freshwater artesian aquifer of the Los Angeles River. Its residents provided the colonists with seafood, fish, bowls, pelts, and baskets. For pay, they dug ditches, hauled water, and provided domestic help. They often intermarried with the Mexican colonists.\n## Spanish era: 1769-1821\nIn 1542 and 1602, the first Europeans to visit the region were Captain Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo and Captain Sebastián Vizcaíno. The first permanent non-native presence began when the Portolá expedition arrived on August 2, 1769.\n### Plans for the pueblo\nAlthough Los Angeles was a town that was founded by Mexican families from Sonora, it was the Spanish governor of California who named the settlement.\nIn 1777, Governor Felipe de Neve toured Alta California and decided to establish civic pueblos for the support of the military presidios. The new pueblos reduced the secular power of the missions by reducing the military's dependence on them. At the same time, they promoted the development of industry and agriculture.\nGovernor de Neve identified Santa Barbara, San Jose, and Los Angeles as sites for his new pueblos. His plans for them closely followed a set of Spanish city-planning laws contained in the Laws of the Indies promulgated by King Philip II in 1573. Those laws were responsible for laying the foundations of the largest cities in the region at the time, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Tucson, San Antonio, Sonoma, Monterey, Santa Fe, and Laredo.\nThe Spanish system called for an open central plaza, surrounded by a fortified church, administrative buildings, and streets laid out in a grid, defining rectangles of limited size to be used for farming (suertes) and residences (solares).\nIt was in accordance with such precise planning—specified in the Law of the Indies—that Governor de Neve founded the pueblo of San Jose de Guadalupe, California's first municipality, on the great plain of Santa Clara on 29 November 1777.\n### Pobladores\nThe Pobladores (\"settlers\") is the name given to the 22 adults and 22 children from Sonora who founded Los Angeles. Twenty were of African American or Native American descent. In December 1777, Viceroy Antonio María de Bucareli y Ursúa and Commandant General Teodoro de Croix gave approval for the founding of a civic municipality at Los Angeles and a new presidio, or garrison, at Santa Barbara.\nCroix put the California lieutenant governor Fernando Rivera y Moncada in charge of recruiting colonists for the new settlements. He was originally to recruit 55 soldiers, 22 settlers with families and a thousand head of livestock that would include horses for the military. After an exhaustive search that took him to Mazatlán, Rosario, and Durango, Rivera y Moncada recruited only 12 settlers and 45 soldiers. Like the settlers of most towns in New Spain, they had a mix of Indian and Spanish backgrounds. The Quechan Revolt killed 95 settlers and soldiers, including Rivera y Moncada.\nAccording to Croix's Reglamento, the newly baptized Indians were no longer to reside in the mission but had to live in their traditional rancherías (villages). Governor de Neve's plans for the Indians' role in his new town drew instant disapproval from the mission priests.\nZúñiga's party arrived at the mission on 18 July 1781. Some had smallpox, so all were quarantined a short distance away from the mission. Members of the other party arrived at different times by August. They made their way to Los Angeles and probably received their land before September.\n### Founding\nThe official date for the founding of the city is September 4, 1781. The families had arrived from New Spain earlier in 1781, in two groups, and some of them had most likely been working on their assigned plots of land since the early summer.\nThe name first given to the settlement is debated. Historian Doyce B. Nunis has said that the Spanish named it \"El Pueblo de la Reina de los Angeles\" (\"The Town of the Queen of the Angels\"). For proof, he pointed to a map dated 1785, where that phrase was used. Frank Weber, the diocesan archivist, replied, however, that the name given by the founders was \"El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora de los Angeles de Porciuncula\", or \"the town of Our Lady of the Angels of Porciuncula.\" and that the map was in error.\n### Spanish pueblo\nThe town grew as soldiers and other settlers came into town and stayed. In 1784 a chapel was built on the original Plaza. The original Plaza was located a block north and west of the present one — its southeast corner being roughly where the northwesternmost point of the present plaza is, at the former intersection of Upper Main and Marchessault streets. It was also oriented diagonally, i.e. at precisely a 90-degree angle to the four compass points. The pobladores were given title to their land two years later. By 1800, there were 29 buildings that surrounded the Plaza, flat-roofed, one-story adobe buildings with thatched roofs made of tule. By 1821, Los Angeles had grown into a self-sustaining farming community, the largest in Southern California.\nEach settler received four rectangles of land, suertes, for farming, two irrigated plots and two dry ones. When the settlers arrived, the Los Angeles floodplain was heavily wooded with willows and oaks. The Los Angeles River flowed all year. Wildlife was plentiful, including deer and black bears, and even an occasional grizzly bear. There were abundant wetlands and swamps. Steelhead trout and salmon swam the rivers.\nThe first settlers built a water system consisting of ditches (zanjas) leading from the river through the middle of town and into the farmlands. Indians were employed to haul fresh drinking water from a special pool farther upstream. The city was first known as a producer of fine wine grapes. The raising of cattle and the commerce in tallow and hides came later.\nBecause of the great economic potential for Los Angeles, the demand for Indian labor grew rapidly. Yaanga began attracting Indians from the Channel Islands and as far away as San Diego and San Luis Obispo. The village began to look like a refugee camp. Unlike the missions, the pobladores paid Indians for their labor. In exchange for their work as farm workers, vaqueros, ditch diggers, water haulers, and domestic help; they were paid in clothing and other goods as well as cash and alcohol. The pobladores bartered with them for prized sea-otter and seal pelts, sieves, trays, baskets, mats, and other woven goods. This commerce greatly contributed to the economic success of the town and the attraction of other Indians to the city.\nDuring the 1780s, San Gabriel Mission became the object of an Indian revolt. The mission had expropriated all the suitable farming land; the Indians found themselves abused and forced to work on lands that they once owned. A young Indian healer, Toypurina, began touring the area, preaching against the injustices suffered by her people. She won over four rancherías and led them in an attack on the mission at San Gabriel. The soldiers were able to defend the mission, and arrested 17, including Toypurina.\nIn 1787, Governor Pedro Fages outlined his \"Instructions for the Corporal Guard of the Pueblo of Los Angeles.\" The instructions included rules for employing Indians, not using corporal punishment, and protecting the Indian rancherías. As a result, Indians found themselves with more freedom to choose between the benefits of the missions and the pueblo-associated rancherías.\nIn 1795, Sergeant Pablo Cota led an expedition from the Simi Valley through the Conejo-Calabasas region and into the San Fernando Valley. His party visited the rancho of Francisco Reyes. They found the local Indians hard at work as vaqueros and caring for crops. Padre Vincente de Santa Maria was traveling with the party and made these observations:\nAll of pagandom (Indians) is fond of the pueblo of Los Angeles, of the rancho of Reyes, and of the ditches (water system). Here we see nothing but pagans, clad in shoes, with sombreros and blankets, and serving as muleteers to the settlers and rancheros, so that if it were not for the gentiles there were neither pueblos nor ranches. These pagan Indians care neither for the missions nor for the missionaries.\nNot only economic ties but also marriage drew many Indians into the life of the pueblo. In 1784, only three years after the founding, the first recorded marriages in Los Angeles took place. The two sons of settler Basilio Rosas, Maximo and José Carlos, married two young Indian women, María Antonia and María Dolores.\nThe construction on the Plaza of La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de Los Ángeles took place between 1818 and 1822, much of it with Indian labor. The new church completed Governor de Neve's planned transition of authority from mission to pueblo. The angelinos no longer had to make the bumpy 11-mile (18 km) ride to Sunday Mass at Mission San Gabriel.\nIn 1811, the population of Los Angeles had increased to more than five hundred persons, of which ninety-one were heads of families.\nIn 1820, the route of El Camino Viejo was established from Los Angeles, over the mountains to the north and up the west side of the San Joaquin Valley to the east side of San Francisco Bay.\n## Mexican era: 1821-1848\nMexico's independence from Spain on September 28, 1821, was celebrated with great festivity throughout Alta California. No longer subjects of the king, people were now ciudadanos, citizens with rights under the law. In the plazas of Monterey, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and other settlements, people swore allegiance to the new government, the Spanish flag was lowered, and the flag of independent Mexico raised.\nIndependence brought other advantages, including economic growth. There was a corresponding increase in population as more Indians were assimilated and others arrived from America, Europe, and other parts of Mexico. Before 1820, there were just 650 people in the pueblo. By 1841, the population nearly tripled to 1,680.\n### Secularization of the missions\nDuring the rest of the 1820s, the agriculture and cattle ranching expanded as did the trade in hides and tallow. The new church was completed, and the political life of the city developed. Los Angeles was separated from Santa Barbara administration. The system of ditches which provided water from the river was rebuilt. In 1827 Jonathan Temple and John Rice opened the first general store in the pueblo, soon followed by J. D. Leandry. Trade and commerce further increased with the secularization of the California missions by the Mexican Congress in 1833. Extensive mission lands suddenly became available to government officials, ranchers, and land speculators. The governor made more than 800 land grants during this period, including a grant of over 33,000-acres in 1839 to Francisco Sepúlveda which was later developed as the westside of Los Angeles.\nMuch of this progress, however, bypassed the Indians of the traditional villages who were not assimilated into the mestizo culture. Being regarded as minors who could not think for themselves, they were increasingly marginalized and relieved of their land titles, often by being drawn into debt or alcohol.\nIn 1834, Governor Pico was married to Maria Ignacio Alvarado in the Plaza church. It was attended by the entire population of the pueblo, 800 people, plus hundreds from elsewhere in Alta California. In 1835, the Mexican Congress declared Los Angeles a city, making it the official capital of Alta California. It was now the region's leading city.\nThe same period also saw the arrival of many foreigners from the United States and Europe. They played a pivotal role in the U.S. takeover. Early California settler John Bidwell included several historical figures in his recollection of people he knew in March 1845.\nIt then had probably two hundred and fifty people, of whom I recall Don Abel Stearns, John Temple, Captain Alexander Bell, William Wolfskill, Lemuel Carpenter, David W. Alexander; also of Mexicans, Pio Pico (governor), Don Juan Bandini, and others.\nUpon arriving in Los Angeles in 1831, Jean-Louis Vignes bought 104 acres (0.42 km2) of land located between the original Pueblo and the banks of the Los Angeles River. He planted a vineyard and prepared to make wine. He named his property El Aliso after the centuries-old tree found near the entrance. The grapes available at the time, of the Mission variety, were brought to Alta California by the Franciscan Brothers at the end of the 18th century. They grew well and yielded large quantities of wine, but Jean-Louis Vignes was not satisfied with the results. Therefore, he decided to import better vines from Bordeaux: Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Sauvignon blanc. In 1840, Jean-Louis Vignes made the first recorded shipment of California wine. The Los Angeles market was too small for his production, and he loaded a shipment on the Monsoon, bound for Northern California. By 1842, he made regular shipments to Santa Barbara, Monterey and San Francisco. By 1849, El Aliso, was the most extensive vineyard in California. Vignes owned over 40,000 vines and produced 150,000 bottles, or 1,000 barrels, per year.\nIn 1836, the Indian village of Yaanga was relocated near the future corner of Commercial and Alameda Streets. In 1845, it was relocated again to present-day Boyle Heights. With the coming of the U.S. citizens, disease took a great toll among Indians. Self-employed Indians were not allowed to sleep over in the city. They faced increasing competition for jobs as more Mexicans moved into the area and took over the labor force. Those who loitered or were drunk or unemployed were arrested and auctioned off as laborers to those who paid their fines. They were often paid for work with liquor, which only increased their problems.\n### Invasion by United States\nIn May 1846, the Mexican–American War started. Because of Mexico's inability to defend its northern territories, California was exposed to invasion. On August 13, 1846, Commodore Robert F. Stockton, accompanied by John C. Frémont, seized the town; Governor Pico had fled to Mexico. From Stockton and Frémont until late 1849, all of California had a military governor. After three weeks of occupation, Stockton left, leaving Lieutenant Archibald H. Gillespie in charge. Subsequent dissatisfaction with Gillespie and his troops led to an uprising. A force of 300 locals drove the Americans out, ending the first phase of the Battle of Los Angeles. Further small skirmishes took place. Stockton regrouped in San Diego and marched north with six hundred troops while Frémont marched south from Monterey with 400 troops. After a few skirmishes outside the city, the two forces entered Los Angeles, this time without bloodshed. Andrés Pico was in charge; he signed the so-called Treaty of Cahuenga (it was not a treaty) on 13 January 1847, ending the California phase of the Mexican–American War. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed on 2 February 1848, ended the war and ceded California to the U.S.\n## Early American era: 1847-1870\nAccording to historian Mary P. Ryan, \"The U.S. army swept into California with the surveyor as well as the sword and quickly translated Spanish and Mexican practices into cartographic representations.\" Under colonial law, land held by grantees was not disposable. It reverted to the government. It was determined that under U.S. property law, lands owned by the city were disposable. Also, the diseños (property sketches) held by residents did not secure title in an American court.\nCalifornia's new military governor Bennett C. Riley ruled that land could not be sold that was not on a city map. In 1849, Lieutenant Edward Ord surveyed Los Angeles to confirm and extend the streets of the city. His survey put the city into the real-estate business, creating its first real-estate boom and filling its treasury. Street names were changed from Spanish to English. Further surveys and street plans replaced the original plan for the pueblo with a new civic center south of the Plaza and a new use of space.\nThe fragmentation of Los Angeles real estate on the Anglo-Mexican axis had begun. Under the Spanish system, the residences of the power-elite clustered around the Plaza in the center of town. In the new U.S. system, the power elite resided in the outskirts. The emerging minorities, including the Chinese, Italians, French, and Russians, joined with the Mexicans near the Plaza.\nIn 1848, the gold discovered in Coloma first brought thousands of miners from Sonora in northern Mexico on the way to the gold fields. So many of them settled in the area north of the Plaza that it came to be known as Sonoratown.\nDuring the Gold Rush years in northern California, Los Angeles became known as the \"Queen of the Cow Counties\" for its role in supplying beef and other foodstuffs to hungry miners in the north. Among the cow counties, Los Angeles County had the largest herds in the state followed closely by Santa Barbara and Monterey Counties.\nWith the temporary absence of a legal system, the city quickly was submerged in lawlessness. Many of the New York regiment disbanded at the end of the war and charged with maintaining order were thugs and brawlers. They roamed the streets joined by gamblers, outlaws, and prostitutes driven out of San Francisco and mining towns of the north by Vigilance Committees or lynch mobs. Los Angeles came to be known as the \"toughest and most lawless city west of Santa Fe.\"\nSome of the residents resisted the new powers by resorting to banditry against the gringos. In 1856, Juan Flores threatened Southern California with a full-scale revolt. He was hanged in Los Angeles in front of 3,000 spectators. Tiburcio Vasquez, a legend in his own time among the Mexican-born population for his daring feats against the Anglos, was captured in present-day Santa Clarita, California, on May 14, 1874. He was found guilty of two counts of murder by a San Jose jury in 1874, and was hanged there in 1875.\nLos Angeles had several active \"Vigilance Committees\" during that era. Between 1850 and 1870, mobs carried out approximately 35 lynchings of Mexicans—more than four times the number that occurred in San Francisco. Los Angeles was described as \"undoubtedly the toughest town of the entire nation.\" The homicide rate between 1847 and 1870 averaged 158 per 100,000 (13 murders per year), which was 10 to 20 times the annual murder rates for New York City during the same period.\nThe fear of Mexican violence and the racially motivated violence inflicted on them further marginalized the Mexicans, greatly reducing their economic and political opportunities.\nJohn Gately Downey, the seventh governor of California was sworn into office on January 14, 1860, thereby becoming the first governor from Southern California. Governor Downey was born and raised in Castlesampson, County Roscommon, Ireland, and came to Los Angeles in 1850. He was responsible for keeping California in the Union during the Civil War.\n### Plight of the Indians\nLos Angeles was incorporated as a U.S. city on April 4, 1850. Five months later, California was admitted into the Union. Although the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo required the U.S. to grant citizenship to the Indians of former Mexican territories, it did not happen for another 80 years. The Constitution of California deprived Indians of any protection under the law, considering them as non-persons. As a result, it was impossible to bring an Anglo to trial for killing an Indian or forcing Indians off their properties. Anglos concluded that the \"quickest and best way to get rid of (their) troublesome presence was to kill them off, (and) this procedure was adopted as a standard for many years.\"\nWith the coming of the U.S. citizens, disease took a great toll among Indians. Self-employed Indians were not allowed to sleep over in the city. They faced increasing competition for jobs as more Mexicans moved into the area and took over the labor force. Those who loitered or were drunk or unemployed were arrested and auctioned off as laborers to those who paid their fines. They were often paid for work with liquor, which only increased their problems.\nWhen New England author and Indian-rights activist Helen Hunt Jackson toured the Indian villages of Southern California in 1883, she was appalled by the racism of the Anglos living there. She wrote that they treated Indians worse than animals, hunted them for sport, robbed them of their farmlands, and brought them to the edge of extermination. While Indians were depicted by Whites as lazy and shiftless, she found most of them to be hard-working craftsmen and farmers. Jackson's tour inspired her to write her 1884 novel Ramona, which she hoped would give a human face to the atrocities and indignities suffered by the Indians in California, and it did. The novel was enormously successful, inspiring four movies and a yearly pageant in Hemet, California. Many of the Indian villages of Southern California survived because of her efforts, including Morongo, Cahuilla, Soboba, Temecula, Pechanga, and Warner Springs.\nRemarkably, the Tongva also survived. in 2006, the Los Angeles Times reported that there were 2,000 of them still living in Southern California. Some were organizing to protect burial and cultural sites. Others were trying to win federal recognition as a tribe to operate a casino.\n## Industrial expansion and growth\nThe city's first newspaper, Star of Los Angeles, was a bilingual publication which began its run in 1851.\nIn the 1870s, Los Angeles was still little more than a village of 5,000. By 1900, there were over 100,000 occupants of the city. Several men actively promoted Los Angeles, working to develop it into a great city and to make themselves rich. Angelenos set out to remake their geography to challenge San Francisco with its port facilities, railway terminal, banks and factories. The Farmers and Merchants Bank of Los Angeles was the first incorporated bank in Los Angeles, founded in 1871 by John G. Downey and Isaias W. Hellman. Wealthy Easterners who came as tourists recognized the growth opportunities and invested heavily in the region. During the 1880s and 1890s, the central business district (CBD) grew along Main and Spring streets towards Second Street and beyond.\nMuch of Los Angeles County was farmland, with an emphasis on cattle, dairy products, vegetables and citrus fruits. After 1945, most of the farmland was converted into housing tracts.\n### Railroads\nThe city's first railroad, the Los Angeles & San Pedro Railroad, was inaugurated in October 1869 by John G. Downey and Phineas Banning. It ran 21 miles (34 km) between San Pedro and Los Angeles.\nThe town continued to grow at a moderate pace. Railroads finally arrived to connect with the Central Pacific and San Francisco in 1876. The impact was small. Much greater was the impact of the Santa Fe system (through its subsidiary California Southern Railroad) in 1885. The Santa Fe and Southern Pacific lines provided direct connections to the East, competed vigorously for business with much lower rates, and stimulated economic growth. Tourists poured in by the thousands every week, and many planned on returning or resettling.\nThe city still lacked a modern harbor. Phineas Banning excavated a channel out of the mud flats of San Pedro Bay leading to Wilmington in 1871. Banning had already laid track and shipped in locomotives to connect the port to the city. Harrison Gray Otis, founder and owner of the Los Angeles Times, and a number of business colleagues embarked on reshaping southern California by expanding that into a harbor at San Pedro using federal dollars.\nThis put them in conflict with Collis P. Huntington, president of the Southern Pacific Company and one of California's \"Big Four\" investors in the Central Pacific and Southern Pacific. (The \"Big Four\" are sometimes numbered among the \"robber barons\" of the Gilded Age). Southern Pacific had initially supported the San Pedro port, and when in 1875 a potential rival emerged in a Santa Monica wharf connected to downtown by the Los Angeles and Independence Railroad, Southern Pacific bought the railroad and demolished the wharf. However, by the 1890s Southern Pacific favored a location for the Port of Los Angeles in Santa Monica because of their control of the land there, and opened the Long Wharf in 1894. The Wharf extended 4,600 feet into the ocean, and was the longest wharf in the world at the time. The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce feared Southern Pacific controlling the port, and so attempted to favor the San Pedro location, sparking the Free Harbor Fight. Congress authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to choose the location, and in 1897 they chose San Pedro.\nIn 1876 the Newhall railroad tunnel located 27 miles (43 km) north of Los Angeles between the town of San Fernando and Lyons Station Stagecoach Stop (now Newhall) was completed, providing the final link from San Francisco to Los Angeles for the railroad. The 6,940-foot-long railroad tunnel (2,115.3 m) took a year and a half to complete. More than 1,500 mostly Chinese laborers took part in the tunnel construction, which began at the south end of the mountain on March 22, 1875. Many of them had prior experience working on Southern Pacific's located tunnels in the Tehachapi Pass. Due to the sandstone composition of the mountain that was saturated with water and oil, frequent cave-ins occurred and the bore had to be constantly shored up by timbers during excavation. The initial location for the north end of the tunnel near Newhall was abandoned due to this. The north end of the tunnel excavation commenced in June 1875. Water was a constant problem during construction and pumps were utilized to keep the tunnel from flooding. Workers digging from both the north and south ends of the tunnel came face to face on July 14, 1876. The bores from each end were only a half inch out of line with dimensions of 22 feet (6.7 m) high, 16.5 feet (5.0 m) wide at the bottom and over 18 feet (5.5 m) at the shoulders. Track was laid in place soon after the tunnel dig was completed and the first train passed through on August 12, 1876. On September 4, Charles Crocker notified Southern Pacific that the track had been completed on the route between San Francisco and Los Angeles.\nThe San Pedro forces eventually prevailed (though it required Banning and Downey to turn their railroad over to the Southern Pacific). Work on the San Pedro breakwater began in 1899 and was finished in 1910. Otis Chandler and his allies secured a change in state law in 1909 that allowed Los Angeles to absorb San Pedro and Wilmington, using a long, narrow corridor of land to connect them with the rest of the city. The debacle of the future Los Angeles harbor was termed the Free Harbor Fight.\nStreetcar service in Los Angeles began with horsecars (1874-1897), cable cars (1885-1902) and electric streetcars starting in 1887–1963. In 1898, Henry Huntington and a San Francisco syndicate led by Isaias W. Hellman purchased five trolley lines, consolidated them into the Los Angeles Railway (the 'yellow cars') and two years later founded the Pacific Electric Railway (the 'red cars'). Los Angeles Railway served the city and the Pacific Electric Railway served the rest of the county. At its peak, Pacific Electric was the largest electrically operated interurban railway in the world. Over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) of tracks connected Los Angeles with Hollywood, Pasadena, San Pedro, Long Beach, Venice Beach, Santa Monica, even as far as Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Ana, and Newport Beach. The Guardian concluded that at their peak, the Pacific Electric and Los Angeles Railway (itself with 642 miles of track) \"made the region's public transportation the best in the country, if not the world\".\n### Oil discovery\nOil was discovered by Edward L. Doheny in 1892, near the present location of Dodger Stadium. The Los Angeles City Oil Field was the first of many fields in the basin to be exploited, and in 1900 and 1902, respectively, the Beverly Hills Oil Field and Salt Lake Oil Field were discovered a few miles west of the original find. Los Angeles became a center of oil production in the early 20th century, and by 1923, the region was producing one-quarter of the world's total supply; it is still a significant producer, with the Wilmington Oil Field having the fourth-largest reserves of any field in California.\n## Conflicts\nWith the growth of Los Angeles, came conflicts and a high crime rate. Some of the conflicts were racial.\n### The Chinese Massacre of 1871\nAlthough there had been some anti-Chinese behavior in the preceding decades, editorial attacks in the local press beginning just before 1870 was followed by increased attacks. A racial massacre targeting Chinese immigrants occurred on October 24, 1871 when approximately 500 white and Hispanic Americans attacked, harassed, robbed, and murdered the ethnic Chinese residents. The mob gathered after hearing that a policeman and a rancher had been killed as a result of a conflict between rival tongs. Nineteen Chinese immigrants were killed, fifteen of whom were later hanged by the mob in the course of the riot. Those killed represented over 10% of the small Chinese population of Los Angeles at the time, which numbered 172 prior to the massacre.\n### Populism\nAt the same time that the Los Angeles Times was spurring enthusiasm for the expansion of Los Angeles, the newspaper was also trying to turn it into a union-free or open shop town. Fruit growers and local merchants who had opposed the Pullman strike in 1894 subsequently formed the Merchants and Manufacturers Association (M & M) to support the Times's anti-union campaign.\nThe California labor movement, with its strength concentrated in San Francisco, largely had ignored Los Angeles for years. However, in 1907, the American Federation of Labor decided to challenge the open shop.\nIn 1909, the city fathers placed a ban on free speech from public streets and private property except for the Plaza. Locals had claimed that it had been an Open Forum forever. The area was of particular concern to Harrison Grey Otis and his son-in-law Harry Chandler.\nThis conflict came to a head with the bombing of the Times in 1910. Two months later, the Llewellyn Iron Works near the plaza was bombed. A meeting hastily was called of the Chamber of Commerce and Manufacturers Association. The L.A. Times wrote: \"radical and practical matters (were) considered, and steps taken for the adaption of such as are adequate to cope with a situation tardily recognized as the gravest that Los Angeles has ever been called upon to face.\"\nThe authorities indicted John and James McNamara, both associated with the Iron Workers Union, for the bombing; Clarence Darrow, famed Chicago defense lawyer, represented them.\nAt the same time the McNamara brothers were awaiting trial, Los Angeles was preparing for a city election. Job Harriman, running on the socialist ticket, was challenging the establishment's candidate.\nHarriman's campaign, however, was tied to the asserted innocence of the McNamaras. But the defense was in trouble: The prosecution not only had evidence of the McNamaras' complicity, but had trapped Darrow in a clumsy attempt to bribe one of the jurors. On December 1, 1911, four days before the final election, the McNamaras entered a plea of guilty in return for prison terms. Harriman lost badly.\nOn Christmas Day, 1913, police attempted to break up an IWW rally of 500 taking place in the Plaza. Encountering resistance, the police waded into the crowd attacking them with their clubs. One citizen was killed. In the aftermath, the authorities attempted to impose martial law in the wake of growing protests.\nSeventy-three people were arrested in connection with the riots. The city council introduced new measures to control public speaking. The Times called onlookers and taco vendors \"cultural subversives.\"\nThe open shop campaign continued from strength to strength, although not without meeting opposition from workers. By 1923, the Industrial Workers of the World had made considerable progress in organizing the longshoremen in San Pedro and led approximately 3,000 men to walk off the job. With the support of the Los Angeles Times, a special \"Red Squad\" was formed within the Los Angeles Police Department and arrested so many strikers that the city's jails were soon filled.\nSome 1,200 dock workers were corralled in a special stockade in Griffith Park. The Times wrote approvingly that \"stockades and forced labor were a good remedy for IWW terrorism.\" Public meetings were outlawed in San Pedro, Upton Sinclair was arrested at Liberty Hill in San Pedro for reading the United States Bill of Rights on the private property of a strike supporter (the arresting officer told him \"we'll have none of 'that Constitution stuff'\") and blanket arrests were made at union gatherings. The strike ended after members of the Ku Klux Klan and the American Legion raided the IWW Hall and attacked the men, women and children meeting there. The strike was defeated.\nLos Angeles developed another industry in the early 20th century when movie producers from the East Coast relocated there. These new employers were likewise afraid of unions and other social movements: During Upton Sinclair's campaign for governor of California under the banner of his \"End Poverty In California\" (EPIC) movement, Louis B. Mayer turned MGM's Culver City studio into the unofficial headquarters of the organized campaign against EPIC. MGM produced fake newsreel interviews with whiskered actors with Russian accents voicing their enthusiasm for EPIC, along with footage focusing on central casting hobos huddled on the borders of California waiting to enter and live off the bounty of its taxpayers once Sinclair was elected. Sinclair, however, lost the election.\nLos Angeles also acquired another industry in the years just before World War II: the garment industry. At first devoted to regional merchandise such as sportswear, the industry eventually grew to be the second largest center of garment production in the United States.\n### Progressives\nThe immigrants arriving in the city to find jobs sometimes brought the revolutionary zeal and idealism of their homelands. These included anarchists such as Russian Emma Goldman and Ricardo Flores Magón and his brother Enrique of the Partido Liberal Mexicano. They later were joined by the socialist candidate for mayor Job Harriman, Chinese revolutionaries, the novelist Upton Sinclair, \"Wobblies\" (members of the Industrial Workers of the World, the IWW), and Socialist and Communist labor organizers such as the Japanese-American Karl Yoneda and the Russian-born New Yorker Meyer Baylin. The socialists were the first to set up a soapbox in the Plaza, which served as the location of union rallies and protests and riots as the police attempted to break up meetings.\nUnions began to make progress in organizing these workers as the New Deal arrived in the 1930s. An influential strike was the Los Angeles Garment Workers Strike of 1933, one of the first strikes in which Mexican immigrant workers played a prominent role for union recognition. The unions made even greater gains in the war years, as Los Angeles grew further.\nToday, the ethnic makeup of the city and the dominance of progressive political views among its voters have made Los Angeles a strong union town. However, many garment workers in Central L.A., most of whom are Mexican immigrants, still work in sweatshop conditions.\n### Battle of the Los Angeles River\nThe Los Angeles River flowed clear and fresh all year, supporting 45 Tongva villages in the area. The source of the river was the aquifer under the San Fernando Valley, supplied with water from the surrounding mountains. The rising of the underground bedrock at the Glendale Narrows (near today's Griffith Park) squeezed the water to the surface at that point. Then, through much of the year, the river emerged from the valley to flow across the floodplain 20 miles (32 km) to the sea. The area also provided other streams, lakes, and artesian wells.\nEarly settlers were more than a little discouraged by the region's diverse and unpredictable weather. They watched helplessly as long droughts weakened and starved their livestock, only to be drowned and carried off by ferocious storms. During the years of little rain, people built too close to the riverbed, only to see their homes and barns later swept to sea during a flood. The location of the Los Angeles Plaza had to be moved twice because of previously having been built too close to the riverbed.\nWorse, floods changed the river's course. When the settlers arrived, the river joined Ballona Creek to discharge in Santa Monica Bay. A fierce storm in 1835 diverted its course to Long Beach, where it stays today.\nEarly citizens could not even maintain a footbridge over the river from one side of the city to the other. After the American takeover, the city council authorized spending of $20,000 for a contractor to build a substantial wooden bridge across the river. The first storm to come along dislodged the bridge, used it as a battering ram to break through the embankment, and scattered its timbers all the way to the sea.\nSome of the most concentrated rainfall in the history of the United States has occurred in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles and Orange Counties. On April 5, 1926, a rain gauge in the San Gabriels collected one inch in one minute. In January 1969, more water fell on the San Gabriels in nine days than New York City sees in a year. In February 1978, almost a foot of rain fell in 24 hours, and, in one blast, an inch and a half in five minutes. This storm caused massive debris flows throughout the region, one of them unearthing the corpses in the Verdugo Hills Cemetery and depositing them in the town below. Another wiped out the small town of Hidden Springs in a tributary of the Big Tujunga Creek, killing 13 people.\nThe greatest daily rainfall recorded in California was 26.12 inches on January 23, 1943, at Hoegees near Mt. Wilson in the San Gabriel Mountains. Fifteen other stations reported over 20 inches in two days from the same storm. Forty-five others reported 70% of the average annual rainfall in two days.\nQuibbling between city and county governments delayed any response to the flooding until a massive storm in 1938 flooded Los Angeles and Orange counties. The federal government stepped in. To transfer floodwater to the sea as quickly as possible, the Army Corps of Engineers paved the beds of the river and its tributaries. The corps also built several dams and catchment basins in the canyons along the San Gabriel Mountains to reduce the debris flows. It was an enormous project, taking years to complete.\nToday, the Los Angeles River functions mainly as a flood control. A drop of rain falling in the San Gabriel Mountains will reach the sea faster than an auto can drive. During today's rainstorms, the volume of the Los Angeles River at Long Beach can be as large as the Mississippi River at St. Louis.\nThe drilling of wells and pumping of water from the San Fernando Valley aquifer dried up the river by the 1920s. By 1980, the aquifer was supplying drinking water for 800,000 people. In that year, it was discovered that the aquifer had been contaminated. Many wells were shut down, as the area qualified as a Superfund site.\n### Water from a distance\nFor its first 120 years, the Los Angeles River supplied the town with ample water for homes and farms. It was estimated that the annual flow could have support a town of 250,000 people—if the water had been managed right. But Angelenos were among the more profligate users of water in the world. In the semi-arid climate, they were forever watering their lawns, gardens, orchards, and vineyards. Later, they needed more to support the growth of commerce and manufacturing. By the beginning of the 20th century, the town realized it quickly would outgrow its river and would need new sources of water.\nLegitimate concerns about water supply were exploited to gain backing for a huge engineering and legal effort to bring more water to the city and allow more development. The city fathers had their eyes on the Owens River, about 250 miles (400 km) northeast of Los Angeles in Inyo County, near the Nevada state line. It was a permanent stream of fresh water fed by the melted snows of the eastern Sierra Nevada. It flowed through the Owens River Valley before emptying into the shallow, saline Owens Lake, where it evaporated.\nSometime between 1899 and 1903, Harrison Gray Otis and his son-in-law successor, Harry Chandler, engaged in successful efforts at buying cheap land on the northern outskirts of Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley. At the same time, they enlisted the help of William Mulholland, chief engineer of the Los Angeles Water Department (later the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power or LADWP), and J.B. Lippencott, of the United States Reclamation Service.\nLippencott performed water surveys in the Owens Valley for the Service while secretly receiving a salary from the City of Los Angeles. He succeeded in persuading Owens Valley farmers and mutual water companies to pool their interests and surrender the water rights to 200,000 acres (800 km2) of land to Fred Eaton, Lippencott's agent and a former mayor of Los Angeles. Lippencott then resigned from the Reclamation Service, took a job with the Los Angeles Water Department as assistant to Mulholland, and turned over the Reclamation Service maps, field surveys and stream measurements to the city. Those studies served as the basis for designing the longest aqueduct in the world.\nBy July 1905, the Times began to warn the voters of Los Angeles that the county would soon dry up unless they voted bonds for building the aqueduct. Artificial drought conditions were created when water was run into the sewers to decrease the supply in the reservoirs and residents were forbidden to water their lawns and gardens.\nOn election day, the people of Los Angeles voted for $22.5 million worth of bonds to build an aqueduct from the Owens River and to defray other expenses of the project. With this money, and with an Act of Congress allowing cities to own property outside their boundaries, the city acquired the land that Eaton had acquired from the Owens Valley farmers and started to build the aqueduct. On the occasion of the opening of the Los Angeles Aqueduct on November 5, 1913, Mulholland's entire speech was five words: \"There it is. Take it.\"\n## Boom town: 1913–1941\n### Hollywood\nHollywood has been synonymous worldwide with the film industry for over a hundred years. It was incorporated as the City of Hollywood in 1903, but merged into LA in 1910. In the 1900s movie makers from New York found the sunny, temperate weather more suitable for year-round location shooting. It boomed into the cinematic heart of the United States, and has been the home and workplace of actors, directors and singers that range from small and independent to world-famous, leading to the development of related television and music industries.\n### Notable events\nSwimming pool desegregation An end to racial segregation in municipal swimming pools was ordered in summer 1931 by a superior court judge after Ethel Prioleau sued the city, complaining that she as a Negro was not allowed to use the pool in nearby Exposition Park but had to travel 3.6 miles to the designated \"negro swimming pool.\"\nSummer Olympics Los Angeles hosted the 1932 Summer Olympics. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which had opened in May, 1923 with a seating capacity of 76,000, was enlarged to accommodate over 100,000 spectators for Olympic events. Olympic Boulevard, a major thoroughfare, honors the occasion. It is still in use by the USC Trojans football team.\nGriffith Park Fire A devastating brush fire on October 3, 1933, killed 29 and injured another 150 workers who were clearing brush in Griffith Park.\n### Annexations and consolidations\nThe City of Los Angeles mostly remained within its original 28 square-mile (73 km2) land grant until the 1890s. The original city limits are visible even today in the layout of streets that changes from a north–south pattern outside of the original land grant to a pattern that is shifted roughly 15 degrees east of the longitude in and closely around the area now known as Downtown. The first large additions to the city were the districts of Highland Park and Garvanza to the north, and the South Los Angeles area. In 1906, the approval of the Port of Los Angeles and a change in state law allowed the city to annex the Shoestring, or Harbor Gateway, a narrow and crooked strip of land leading from Los Angeles south towards the port. The port cities of San Pedro and Wilmington were added in 1909 and the city of Hollywood was added in 1910, bringing the city up to 90 square miles (233 km2) and giving it a vertical \"barbell\" shape. Also added that year was Colegrove, a suburb west northwest of the city near Hollywood; Cahuenga, a township northwest of the former city limits; and a part of Los Feliz was annexed to the city.\nThe opening of the Los Angeles Aqueduct provided the city with four times as much water as it required, and the offer of water service became a powerful lure for neighboring communities. The city, saddled with a large bond and excess water, locked in customers through annexation by refusing to supply other communities. Harry Chandler, a major investor in San Fernando Valley real estate, used his Los Angeles Times to promote development near the aqueduct's outlet. By referendum of the residents, 170 square miles (440 km2) of the San Fernando Valley, along with the Palms district, were added to the city in 1915, almost tripling its area, mostly towards the northwest. Over the next 17 years. dozens of additional annexations brought the city's area to 450 square miles (1,165 km2) in 1932. (Numerous small annexations brought the total area of the city up to 469 square miles (1,215 km2) as of 2004.)\nMost of the annexed communities were unincorporated towns but 10 incorporated cities were consolidated with Los Angeles: Wilmington (1909), San Pedro (1909), Hollywood (1910), Sawtelle (1922), Hyde Park (1923), Eagle Rock (1923), Venice (1925), Watts (1926), Barnes City (1927), and Tujunga (1932).\n### Civic corruption and police brutality\nThe downtown business interests, always eager to attract business and investment to Los Angeles, were also eager to distance their town from the criminal underworld that defined the stories of Chicago and New York. In spite of their concerns, massive corruption in City Hall and the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)—and the fight against it—were dominant themes in the city's story from early 20th-century to the 1950s.\nIn the 1920s, for example, it was common practice for the city's mayor, councilmen, and attorneys to take contributions from madams, bootleggers, and gamblers. The top aide of the mayor was involved with a protection racket. Thugs with eastern-Mafia connections were involved in often violent conflicts over bootlegging and horse-racing turf. The mayor's brother was selling jobs in the Los Angeles Police Department.\nIn 1933, the new mayor Frank Shaw started giving contracts without competitive bids and paying city employees to favor crony contractors. The city's Vice Squad functioned citywide as the enforcer and collector of the city's organized crime, with revenues going to the pockets of city officials right up to the mayor.\nIn 1937, the owner of downtown's Clifton's Cafeteria, Clifford Clinton led a citizen's campaign to clean up city hall. He and other reformers served on a Grand Jury investigating the charges of corruption. In a minority report, the reformers wrote:\nA portion of the underworld profits have been used in financing campaigns  ... city and county officials in vital positions ...  the district attorney's office, sheriff's office, and Los Angeles Police Department work in complete harmony and never interfere with ... important figures in the underworld.\nThe police Intelligence Squad spied on anyone even suspected of criticizing the police. They included journalist Carey McWilliams, the District Attorney, Judge Fletcher Bowron, and two of the county supervisors.\nThe persistent courage of Clinton, Superior Court Judge and later Mayor, Fletcher Bowron, and former police detective Harry Raymond turned the tide. The police became so nervous that the Intelligence Squad blew up Raymond's car and nearly killed him. The public was so enraged by the bombing that it quickly voted Shaw out of office, one of the first big-city recalls in the country's history. The head of the intelligence squad was convicted and sentenced to two years to life. Police Chief James Davis and 23 other officers were forced to resign.\nFletcher Bowron replaced Shaw as mayor in 1938 to preside over one of the more dynamic periods in the history of the city. His \"Los Angeles Urban Reform Revival\" brought major changes to the government of Los Angeles.\nIn 1950, he appointed William H. Parker as chief of police. Parker pushed for more independence from political pressures that enabled him to create a more professionalized police force. The public supported him and voted in charter changes that isolated the police department from the rest of government.\nThrough the 1960s, the LAPD was promoted as one of the more efficient departments in the world. But Parker's administration increasingly was charged with police brutality—resulting from his recruiting of officers from the South with strong anti-black and anti-Mexican attitudes.\nReaction to police brutality resulted in the Watts riots of 1965 and in the Los Angeles riots of 1992, after the Rodney King beating. Charges of police brutality dogged the department through the end of the 20th century. In the late 1990s, as a result of the Rampart scandal involving misconduct of 70 officers, the federal government was forced to intervene and assumed jurisdiction of the department with a consent decree. Police reform has since been a major issue confronted by the city's mayors.\nSocial critic Mike Davis argued that attempts to \"revitalize\" downtown Los Angeles decreases public space and further alienates poor and minority populations. This enforced geographical separation of diverse populations goes back to the city's earliest days.\n### LAX: Los Angeles International Airport\nMines Field opened as the private airport in 1930, and the city purchased it to be the municipal airfield in 1937. The name became Los Angeles Airport in 1941 and Los Angeles International Airport in 1949. In the 1930s, the main airline airports were Hollywood Burbank Airport (then known as Union Air Terminal, and later Lockheed) in Burbank and the Grand Central Airport in Glendale. In 1940, the airlines were all at Burbank except for Mexicana's three departures a week from Glendale; in late 1946 most airline flights moved to LAX, but Burbank always retained a few. Since then, there has been relentless expansion and the spinoff of hotels and warehouses nearby.\n## World War II: 1941–1945\nDuring World War II, Los Angeles grew as a center for production of aircraft, ships, war supplies, and ammunition. Aerospace employers headquartered in the Los Angeles metropolitan area like Hughes Aircraft Company, Northrop Corporation, Douglas Aircraft Company, Vultee Aircraft (later merged into Convair in 1943), and Lockheed Corporation, were able to provide the nation's demand for the war effort in producing strategic bombers and fighter aircraft like B-17s, B-25s, A-36s, and P-51 Mustangs needed to bomb the war machine of the Axis powers. As a result, the Los Angeles area grew faster than any other major metropolitan area in the U.S. and experienced more of the traumas of war while doing so. By 1943, the population of Los Angeles County was larger than 37 states, and was home to one in every 40 U.S. citizens, as millions across the U.S. came to Southern California to find employment in the defense industries.\nThe Japanese-American community in Los Angeles was greatly impacted since Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor pulled the U.S. into World War II, and America feared that the fifth column was widespread among the community. In response, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing military commanders to exclude \"any or all persons\" from certain areas in the name of national defense. The Western Defense Command began ordering Japanese-Americans living on the West Coast to present themselves for \"evacuation\" from the newly created military zones. This included many Los Angeles families, of which 80,000 were relocated to the Japanese-American internment camps throughout the duration of the war.\nThe war also lured a large number of African Americans from the rural impoverished Southern states to the Los Angeles area in the second chapter of the Great Migration, due to manpower industrial shortages and Executive Order 8802, which prohibited discrimination in wartime defense industries. Lonnie Bunch, a longtime historian with the Smithsonian Institution, wrote, \"Between 1942-1945, some 340,000 Blacks settled in California, 200,000 of whom migrated to Los Angeles.\" Most of these migrants to Los Angeles came from South Central states like Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. African Americans particularly benefited from defense jobs created in Los Angeles County during the war, especially Terminal Island, where it was one of the first places of integrated, defense-related work on the West Coast. Though Jim Crow laws did not exist in Los Angeles as it had in the South, black migrants continued to face racial discrimination in most aspects of life, especially widespread housing segregation and redlining due to overcrowding and perceived lower property value during and after the war, in which they were restricted from advanced opportunities in affluent white areas and confined to an exclusive-black majority area of South Central Los Angeles.\nAs with a few other wartime industrial cities in the U.S., Los Angeles experienced a racial-related conflict stemming from the Zoot Suit Riots in June 1943, in which American servicemen and local Whites attacked young Mexican-Americans in zoot suits. Many military personnel regarded the zoot suits as unpatriotic and flamboyant in time of war, as they had a lot of fabric, coupled with widespread racism against Mexicans and Mexican-Americans as unintelligent and inferior. The Los Angeles Police Department stood by as the rioting happened, arresting hundreds of Hispanic residents instead of the attackers. Riots against Latinos in Los Angeles also erupted in a similar fashion in other cities in California, Texas, and Arizona as well as northern cities like Chicago, Philadelphia, and Detroit.\nWhile Los Angeles County never faced enemy bombing and invasion, it nevertheless became an integral part of the American Theater on the night of February 24–25, 1942, during the false Battle of Los Angeles, which occurred a day after the Japanese naval bombardment of Ellwood in Santa Barbara, California, 80 miles from Los Angeles. Reacting to a report that enemy planes had been spotted over Los Angeles, anti-aircraft gunners in the area fired on the approaching aircraft what was later known to be a U.S. Army weather balloon. Lasted for two hours, five people died in the \"Battle of Los Angeles\", from car crashes in the confusing darkness to people having heart attacks due to loud anti-aircraft gun bursts. In spite of this, the Japanese had plans to actually bomb Los Angeles with giant seaplanes in anticipation of the proposed large-scale invasion of the continental United States. Those raids never came about, but the Japanese had the planes and wherewithal to accomplish such a raid throughout the war.\n## Postwar: Baby boomers\nAfter the war, hundreds of land developers bought land cheap, subdivided it, built on it, and got rich. Real-estate development replaced oil and agriculture as Southern California's principal industry. In July 1955, Walt Disney opened the world's first theme park called Disneyland in Anaheim. Nine years later, Universal Studios opened its first theme park with the public studio tour tram at Universal City. This later touched off a theme park war between Disney and Universal that continue on to the present day. In 1958, Major League Baseball's Dodgers and Giants left New York City and came to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively. The population of California expanded dramatically, to nearly 20 million by 1970. This was the coming-of-age of the baby boom. By 1950, Los Angeles was an industrial and financial giant created by war production and migration. Los Angeles assembled more cars than any city other than Detroit, made more tires than any city but Akron, Ohio, made more furniture than Grand Rapids, Michigan, and stitched more clothes than any city except New York. In addition, it was the national capital for the production of motion pictures, Army and Navy training films, radio programs and, within a few years, television shows. Construction boomed as tract houses were built in ever expanding suburban communities financed by the GI Bill for veterans and the Federal Housing Administration. Popular music of the period bore titles such as \"California Girls\", \"California Dreamin'\", \"San Francisco\", \"Do You Know the Way to San Jose?\" and \"Hotel California\". These reflected the Californian promise of easy living in a paradisiacal climate. The surfing culture burgeoned.\nLos Angeles continued to spread, particularly with the development of the San Fernando Valley and the building of the freeways launched in the 1940s. When the local street car system went out of business due to the gas/automobile industry, Los Angeles became a city shaped around the automobile, with all the social, health and political problems that this dependence produces. The famed urban sprawl of Los Angeles became a notable feature of the town, and the pace of the growth accelerated in the first decades of the 20th century. The San Fernando Valley, sometimes called \"America's Suburb\", became a favorite site of developers, and the city began growing past its roots downtown toward the ocean and towards the east. The immense problem with air pollution (smog) that had developed by the early 1970s also caused a backlash: Schools were closed routinely in urban areas for \"smog days\" when the ozone levels became too unhealthy, and the hills surrounding urban areas were seldom visible even within a mile, Californians were ready for changes. Over the next three decades, California enacted some of the strictest anti-smog regulations in the United States and has been a leader in encouraging nonpolluting strategies for various industries, including automobiles. For example, carpool lanes normally allow only vehicles with two/three or more occupants (whether the base number is two or three depends on what freeway you are on), but electric cars can use the lanes with only a single occupant. As a result, smog is significantly reduced from its peak, although local Air Quality Management Districts still monitor the air and generally encourage people to avoid polluting activities on hot days when smog is expected to be at its worst.\n## 1950–2000\nBeginning November 6, 1961, Los Angeles suffered three days of destructive brush fires. The Bel-Air—Brentwood and Santa Ynez fires destroyed 484 expensive homes and 21 other buildings along with 15,810 acres (64 km2) of brush in the Bel-Air, Brentwood, and Topanga Canyon neighborhoods. Most of the homes destroyed had wooden shake roofs, which not only led to their own loss but also sent firebrands up to three miles (5 km) away. Despite this, few changes were made to the building codes to prevent future losses.\nThe repeal of a law limiting building height and the controversial redevelopment of Bunker Hill, which destroyed a picturesque though decrepit neighborhood, ushered in the construction of a new generation of skyscrapers. Bunker Hill's 62-floor First Interstate Building (later named Aon Center) was the highest in Los Angeles when it was completed in 1973. It was surpassed by the Library Tower (now called the U.S. Bank Tower) a few blocks to the north in 1990, a 310 m (1,018 ft) building that is the tallest west of the Mississippi. Outside of Downtown, the Wilshire Corridor is lined with tall buildings, particularly near Westwood. Century City, developed on the former 20th Century Fox back lot, has become another center of high-rise construction on the Westside.\nDuring the latter decades of the 20th century, the city saw a massive increase of street gangs. At the same time, crack cocaine became widely available and dominated by gangs in the 1980s. Although gangs were disproportionately confined to lower-income inner-city sections, fear knew no boundaries citywide. Since the early 1990s, the city saw a decrease in crime and gang violence with rising prices in housing, revitalization, urban development, and heavy police vigilance in many parts of the city. With its reputation, it had led to Los Angeles being referred as \"The Gang Capital of America\".\nA subway system, developed and built through the 1980s as a major goal of mayor Tom Bradley, stretches from North Hollywood to Union Station and connects to light rail lines that extend to the neighboring cities of Long Beach, Norwalk, and Pasadena, among others. Also, a commuter rail system, Metrolink, has been added that stretches from nearby Ventura and Simi Valley to San Bernardino, Orange County, and Riverside. The funding of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority project is funded by a half cent tax increase added in the mid-1980s, which yields $400 million every month. Although the regional transit system is growing, subway expansion was halted in the 1990s over methane gas concerns, political conflict, and construction and financing problems during Red Line Subway project, which culminated in a massive sinkhole on Hollywood Boulevard. As a result, the original subway plans have been delayed for decades as light rail systems, dedicated busways, and limited-stop \"Rapid\" bus routes have become the preferred means of mass transit in LA's expanding series of gridlocked, congested corridors.\nThe 1995 murder of Stephanie Kuhen in Los Angeles led to condemnation from President Bill Clinton and a crackdown on Los Angeles-area gangs.\n### Racially restrictive housing covenants\nRacially restrictive housing covenants were a major part of Los Angeles housing development and selling of real estate. Racially restrictive covenants were court private agreements included in title deeds that prohibited the selling of property to certain races. The first racially restrictive covenant in Los Angeles dates to 1902 and used the term non-Caucasians to restrict people of color from dwelling in that home. Other language used in covenants excluded specific ethnic groups and sometimes only allowed \"non-Whites\" to occupy a property if they were domestic workers. There was a tendency to exclude Mexican Americans, despite they were legally \"White\" due to Spanish ancestry, Mexican immigrants tend to be indigenous people or mestizo.\nRacially restrictive covenants were implemented by housing developers, real estate agencies, and homeowners associations for the purpose of creating racial and class segregated neighborhoods. Racially restrictive covenants were also implemented in housing developments to secure homogeneous and economically stable neighborhoods. The Janss Investment Company built the community of Westwood. They included racial restrictions in all of their properties that specifically excluded \"any person who is not of the White or the Caucasian race\". Examples of communities in Los Angeles that were built with racial restrictions in deeds are Thousand Oaks, Palos Verdes, Beverly Hills, Bel Air, Westchester, Panorama City, Westside Village, and Toluca Woods among others.\nIn 1892, the federal courts ruled that neither state nor city governments could discriminate but upheld the right to enter into racial and class restrictive covenants. In the period between 1900 and 1920 Los Angeles experienced a boom in housing development during which racially restrictive covenants became widespread. By 1939, almost 47% of Los Angeles County residential neighborhoods included racially restrictive covenants.\nRestricting people of color from many neighborhoods across Los Angeles resulted in the formation of multiracial neighborhoods. These neighborhoods were notably poor and composed of Blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans, Jews, and Italians. Among multiracial neighborhoods in Los Angeles are Boyle Heights, Watts, Belvedere, and South Los Angeles. In the 1930s, Okies from the Central United States settled in the Northern ends of Downtown Los Angeles, mainly they were White, but a large percentage were Cherokee (Native Americans) from Oklahoma.\nRacially restrictive covenants were finally overturned in two landmark cases. Shelley V. Kraemer in 1948 prohibited racially restrictive covenants and invalidated their use in court. The 1956 Barrows V. Jackson case the Supreme Court ruled that racially restrictive covenants were unconstitutional under the 14th amendment. It stated that \"The enforcement of a covenant forbidding use and occupancy of real estate by non-Caucasians, by an action at law in a state court to recover damages from a co-covenantor for a breach of the covenant, is barred by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.\" In 1964, California voters approved Proposition 14 which attempted to validate housing discrimination. However, the proposition was repealed and deemed unconstitutional by the California Supreme Court. While many home deeds in Los Angeles still contain restrictive covenant clauses, they are not legally enforceable.\n### Economic and demographic changes\nThe last of the automobile factories shut down in the 1990s; the tire factories and steel mills left earlier. Most of the agricultural and dairy operations that were still prospering in the 1950s have moved to outlying counties while the furniture industry has relocated to Mexico and other low-wage nations. Aerospace production has dropped significantly since the end of the Cold War or moved to states with better tax conditions, and movie producers sometimes find cheaper places to produce films, television programs and commercials. However, the film, television and music industries are still based in LA, which is home to large numbers of well-paid stars, executives and technicians. Many studios still operate in Los Angeles, such as CBS Television City at the corner of Fairfax Avenue and Beverly Boulevard and 20th Century Fox in Century City. The manufacture of clothing began on a large scale in the early 20th century. The fashion industry emerged in the 1920s with an emphasis on sportswear and leisure clothing, and expanded after 1945 to second place behind New York. Toyota opened its first overseas office in Hollywood in 1957, and sold 257 cars in the U.S. It moved operations to Torrance in 1982 because of easy access to port facilities and the LAX airport. In 2013 it sold 2.2 million vehicles in the U.S. In 2014, it announced it would move 3000 of its employees to Plano, Texas, near Dallas, to be closer to its American factories.\nThe ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach make up the largest harbor complex in the U.S., handling 44% of all goods imported by cargo container. In 2007, the equivalent of 7.85 million 40-foot shipping containers poured through the ports, with most then moving along the region's highways to massive rail yards and warehouses before heading to the nation's interior. International trade has generated hundreds of thousands of jobs in Southern California. Moving goods is now one of the larger industries in the region, one that helps provide low-cost imports to consumers across the country. The ports are among the region's more valuable economic engines.\nThe overall metropolitan L.A. economy was healthy, and in one five-year boom period (1985 to 1990), it attracted 400,000 working immigrants (mostly from Asia and Mexico) and about 575,000 workers from elsewhere in the U.S. The jobs offered depended largely on educational qualifications. Half of the immigrants from abroad owed their employment to the immigrant economy with Asian entrepreneurs employing Latino workers. Large-scale economic changes have brought major social changes with them. While unemployment dropped in Los Angeles in the 1990s, the newly created jobs tended to be low-wage jobs filled by recent immigrants; the number of poor families increased from 36% to 43% of the population of Los Angeles County during this time. At the same time, the number of immigrants from Mexico, Central America and Latin America has made Los Angeles a \"majority minority\" city that will soon (perhaps in the 2020s) be majority Latino, the first time since California statehood in 1850 before Anglo-American settlers came to the city. The unemployment rate dropped from 6.9% to 6.8% in 2002, jumped during the recession of 2008, and hovered around 11-12% in 2011.\nThe desire for residential housing in the downtown area has led to gentrification. Historic commercial buildings have been renovated as condos (while maintaining the original outside design), and many new apartment and condominium towers and complexes are being built.\nSince the 1980s, there has been an increasing gap between the rich and the poor, making Los Angeles one of the more socioeconomically divided city in the United States.\nBy the end of the 20th century, some of the annexed areas began to feel cut off from the political process of the megalopolis, leading to a particularly strong secession movement in the San Fernando Valley and weaker ones in San Pedro and Hollywood. The referendums to split the city were rejected by voters in November 2002.\nMany communities in Los Angeles have changed their ethnic character over this period of time. For many decades, the population was predominantly White and mostly American-born until the late 20th century. South L.A. was mostly White until the 1950s, but then became predominantly black until the 1990s, and is now mainly Latino. While the Latino community within the City of Los Angeles was once centered on the Eastside, it now extends throughout the city. The San Fernando Valley, which represented a bastion of white flight in the 1960s and provided the votes that allowed Sam Yorty to defeat the first election run by Tom Bradley, is now as ethnically diverse as the rest of the city on the other side of the Hollywood Hills.\n## Population history\nThe population of Los Angeles reached more than 100,000 with the 1900 census, more than a million in 1930, more than two million in 1960, and more than 3 million in 1990. Los Angeles surpassed Chicago to become the nation's second largest city between 1980 and 1982, with a population estimated to be 3.022 million in 1982.\nThe population of Los Angeles in 2020 was 3,898,747.\nSources: Historical Census Populations of Counties and Incorporated Cities in California, 1850–2010; Historical Resident Population of Los Angeles during the Spanish & Mexican Period, 1781 to 1840"], "selected_questions": ["When did the history of Los Angeles begin?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The history of Los Angeles began in 1781 when 44 settlers from New Spain established a permanent settlement in what is now Downtown Los Angeles."], "InternLM_answers": ["The history of Los Angeles began in 1781 when 44 settlers from New Spain established a pueblo, which remained a small town for the next 70 years."], "human_GPT3.5_answers_D_ann": [["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> The history of Los Angeles began in 1781<SEP> <"]], "human_InternLM_answers_ann": [["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> The history of Los Angeles began in 1781 when 44 settlers from New Spain established a permanent settlement in what is now Downtown Los Angeles"]], "language": "en"}

{"name": "RAF Bawdsey", "documents": ["# RAF Bawdsey\nRoyal Air Force Bawdsey or more simply RAF Bawdsey is a former Royal Air Force station situated on the eastern coast in Suffolk, England. Also known as Bawdsey Research Station (BRS), the first Chain Home radar station was built there, characterized by eight tall masts, four for transmitting and four for receiving. When the research group moved to Dundee in September 1939, the radar station was left active under the name RAF Bawdsey. The site later hosted a Bristol Bloodhound surface-to-air missile station until 1990, with the station closing in 1991.\n## History\nBawdsey Manor, dating from 1886, was taken over in March 1936 by the Air Ministry for developing the Chain Home (CH) RDF (radar) system. The station's Superintendent was initially Robert Watson-Watt, later followed by A.P. Rowe. The experimental radar station was located just northeast of the Manor, about 200 yards (180 m) distant. When war was declared in September 1939, fears of a possible commando raid on the group led to the development activities being relocated, first to Dundee, Scotland, and later to Worth Matravers near Swanage in Dorset on the southern coast of England, where they became the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE).\nIn the 1950s, the Bawdsey CH station was upgraded as part of the ROTOR programme and gained an underground control centre with living quarters and air filtration to make it capable of operating during nuclear attack. The command centre was accessed by way of a small bungalow which can be seen on the left of the road which runs from Bawdsey village to Bawdsey Manor.\nThe station was stood down for a number of years, but was re-opened in 1978 as a Bloodhound missile site, with the launchers located just to the northwest of the CH site. The missiles were moved to RAF West Raynham in July 1990 and the station closed in March 1991.\n## Current use\nThe remains of the site are still fairly well preserved and will undergo restoration in 2017 due to a £1.4 million Lottery Grant."], "selected_questions": ["What was the purpose of the eight tall masts at RAF Bawdsey?", "Who initially served as the Superintendent of RAF Bawdsey?", "When was RAF Bawdsey re-opened as a Bloodhound missile site?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The eight tall masts at RAF Bawdsey were used for transmitting and receiving signals for the Chain Home (CH) radar system.", "The Superintendent of RAF Bawdsey initially was Robert Watson-Watt.", "RAF Bawdsey was re-opened as a Bloodhound missile site in 1978."], "InternLM_answers": ["The eight tall masts at RAF Bawdsey were used to support the Chain Home radar antenna arrays.

{"name": "Presidio San Agustín del Tucsón", "documents": ["# Presidio San Agustín del Tucsón\nPresidio San Agustín del Tucsón was a presidio (colonial Spanish fort) located within Tucson, Arizona, United States. The original fortress was built by Spanish soldiers during the 18th century and was the founding structure of what became the city of Tucson. After the American arrival in 1846, the original walls were dismantled, with the last section torn down in 1918. A reconstruction of the northeast corner of the fort was completed in 2007 following an archaeological excavation that located the fort's northeast tower.\n## History\n### Spanish Period\nA company of Spanish Army soldiers, led by Captain Hugh O'Conor, an Irish mercenary working for Spain, selected the location of the Presidio San Agustin del Tucson on August 20, 1775. The site was on the east terrace overlooking the Santa Cruz River floodplain. Nearby was the O'odham village of Cuk Ṣon  at the San Agustin Mission. The name (also written S-cuk Son, Ts-iuk-shan, Tu-uk-so-on or Tuqui Son) means \"black base\", referring to the base of Sentinel Peak.\nThe following year, soldiers marched north from the Presidio at Tubac and began construction of the fort. Initially, it consisted of a scattering of buildings, some inside a wooden palisade. Mismanagement of the funds that were to be spent on adobe walls stalled their construction. A near disastrous attack by Apache raiders in June 1782 resulted in renewed efforts to complete the fort, which was accomplished in May 1783. The fort measured about 670 ft (200 m) to a side with square towers at the northeast and southwest corners. The main gate was on the center of the west wall, the presidial chapel was located along the east wall, the commandant's house was in the center, and the interior walls were lined with homes, stables, and warehouses. The massive adobe walls required constant maintenance, especially in times when attacks by Native Americans were anticipated, mostly from Apache. The fortress remained intact until the American arrival in 1856, two years after the Gadsden Treaty transferred southern Arizona to the United States. Afterward, it was rapidly dismantled, with the last standing portion torn down in 1918.\nTucson flourished under Spanish rule, but the population didn't exceed 500 until much later, when the United States controlled the city. The colony managed to grow with the help of the fort and its occupants, who launched several expeditions into Indian country to fight the Seri's, Opatas, Papago and primarily the Apache. The expeditions helped keep the natives from the area, to prevent raids on Spanish property and civilians. Throughout the Spanish period the Pimas were mostly peaceful, with the exception of two rebellions about 25 years before the Tucson Presidio was constructed. Over Tucson's history, several different Native American groups lived in the city and the down river at the villages of Tubac, Tumacacori and elsewhere. Groups of Pimas, Apaches, Papago, Oaptas, Seris, and others, all eventually lived at the Spanish settlements in the Santa Cruz River Valley. Many of the men became scouts for the Spanish Army during the wars against the native tribes. At one point the entire garrison of Fort Tubac consisted solely of Papago warriors. By the time the Spanish period ended in 1821 the old Spanish frontier settlements were being abandoned. The population of Tucson and Tubac each reached about 350 at their peaks during this time. Tumacacori had about 100 Spaniards during its peak years, and the remaining population of the forts and villages were Native American who usually outnumbered the Spanish by dozens to hundreds.\nFort Tubac was abandoned several times over 110 years due to repeated attacks at or near the fort. The garrisons remained relatively small, usually cavalry and some artillery. Lt. Juan de Olivas took command of Tucson after O'Connor from 1775 to 1777; Allande commanded the Tucson Presidio during four different attacks. He also commanded many of the advances into Apacheria and Seri country. Native warriors also contributed to the Tucson Presidio's defense several times during its history of fighting Apaches, sometimes because the natives allied with the Spanish were already long-time enemies with the Apache. The wars grew into sort of a stalemate; eventually the Spanish growth in the presidio topped off resulting in the small company size garrisons. The Spanish at any given point had fewer than 300 soldiers in all their presidios and settlements in the area. Presidio Santa Cruz de Terrenate was built along the San Pedro River southeast of Tucson in 1776, by 1780 it had already been abandoned due to Apache attacks. Presidio de San Bernardino was built just east of the present day Douglas, Arizona, in 1776 but was also abandoned in 1780. The contingents from most native groups which helped the Spanish were typically very small, about fifteen men but the Pimas contributed dozens of warriors to Captain Allande during the years who fought in most if not all of the frontier expeditions. Despite being outnumbered by the thousands, the Spanish held the majority of their settlements but could not decisively defeat the natives and stop them from raiding. Tucson became a Mexican town in 1821.\n### Mexican Period\nWhen Mexico achieved its independence from Spain in 1821, the Tucson Presidio still had a Spanish garrison that accepted Mexican freedom, likely because the Spanish aristocracy's hold on northern Sonora wasn't broken as result of the war. The aristocracy supported the independence of their country which fueled the rebellion, many also led the armies that won the war. Since 1775 and even longer due to the Pima villages, Tucson has always been inhabited, unlike several other Spanish settlements in the area. During the Mexican period at least seventy-five percent of Tucson was populated by Native Americans. After independence Mexico slipped into a depression and frontier colonization quickly became under-supplied with both men and food, old alliances between Spain and the natives ended. Other tribes continued to be peaceful, the Pimas remained friendly along with Yaquis and a few other groups in southern Arizona. Apaches remained a serious threat and most of the Spanish frontier settlements in Arizona and New Mexico were abandoned and the populations fled south. Generally the Mexicans remained only in the coastal states of Texas and California, creating more Indian country in between Mexico City and California. Landlocked settlements in what is now northern New Mexico survived with Tucson and a few other mission towns such as the San Xavier and the Tumacacori Mission. Apaches continued raiding and skirmished with Mexicans just outside the Presidio several times, they raided the livestock just like they did the Spanish herds. The Mexicans were less able to defend themselves due to the depression.\nBy the time the war between the United States and Mexico began in 1846, the depression was over and Mexican Army forces occupied the Tucson presidio. The area was prospering and held its largest garrison of around 200 dragoons or infantrymen with two cannons. In 1846 as the United States Army's Mormon Battalion moved through present day Arizona, they nearly fought a battle with the Mexican army as they approached the fort from the southeast. The Americans were on their way to reinforce the United States Navy's campaign against California. Mormon forces captured the presidio just after the Mexican commander Captain Antonio Comaduron decided not to fight; instead he withdrew his garrison to San Xavier and then to Tubac. The Mormons eventually left Tucson and it was reoccupied by the Mexicans. The war ended with a United States victory and the Mexican Cession in which the Mexican Government sold the Americans most of what is now the southwest United States in 1848. Tucson became part of the American New Mexico Territory after the Gadsden Purchase in 1853. Though the land was purchased the Mexican garrison did not leave the Tucson Presidio until March 1856. The majority of Mexican residents remained behind.\n### American Period\nThe United States Army took control of the Tucson Presidio in 1856 after eighty-one years in existence, and the city began to thrive once more. Famous military figures, prospectors, outlaws and warriors would all become part of Tucson's culture more than ever before. With the discovery of precious minerals in the area in the 18th century by the Spanish and in the 1860s by Americans, mining camps and later mining towns were built all across the desert frontier around Tucson. From 1850 to 1920, mining camps became the center of industrialization, before agriculture and ranching provided the best opportunity of prosperity along the Santa Cruz. The period from 1870 and on is when the speed of settling the frontier became most rapid around Tucson. Most of Arizona's towns and cities were built at this time. Hostile natives remained a problem for the development of unsettled land and continued justly until the late 1880s. Tubac was populated by Americans just after the Mexican War. A mining company town was made of the presidio which again made Tucson a little less isolated. During the early American period, the population grew for the first several years until a major outbreak of the Apache Wars between the Chiricahuas and the American Civil War which ended up creating Arizona into the state it is today. The Chiricahua Apache were commanded by the War Chiefs Mangas Coloradas, Cochise and Geronimo. They and their allies fought primarily a guerrilla war against the remaining Mexican and new American settlements throughout the Gadsden Purchase area, all of which was considered traditional lands of the Apache. The American Indian Wars ended in Arizona, where military campaigns against Native Americans continued as late as 1918.\nThe great war against the Chiricahua began in 1860. After a raiding campaign into American territory against frontier settlements and the Bascom Affair in which Cochise's brother was killed, Chiricahua Apache bands began to form alliances with each other. They built an army of unknown strength which was commanded by Cochise and another chief ally, Mangas Coloradas. The Apaches then began a campaign to rid Apacheria of all the whites and Mexicans. Attacks on settlers started around what is now southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico in the Apache heartland of the Dragoon Mountains, the Dos Cabezas Mountains, the Chiricahua Mountains and Apache Pass. In the area is where the main settlers trail east and west was located. Apaches killed, captured, and tortured at least a 100 people within a year along the trail in and near Apache Pass. Hundreds more settlers were being killed elsewhere across the vast area Apaches controlled. Thousands of settlers were killed in total over the fifty years of conflict, no exact number will ever be known. Tucson was again under what was considered serious threat of attack. Apaches controlled all of the mountains around Tucson in the early 1860s, especially after the withdrawal of United States troops in 1861. Only white settlers, the remaining Tucson Mexicans, and the dwindling Pima tribe inhabited the Tucson area and the Santa Cruz Valley. Apaches were at their high point and controlled almost everywhere around the region but influence was weaker northwest of Tucson in what is now the Tohono O'odham reservation. The O'odham were generally peaceful, the Pimas are one of the larger O'odham bands as of today. When the American Civil War began, all of the forts protecting Tucson were abandoned and the Butterfield Overland Mail company closed just after. Both events left the isolated Tucson area with no military support against the Apache army.\nBeginning just after the 1856 establishment of American Tucson, settlers in the southern New Mexico Territory began petitioning the government for separation. They hoped to establish a new territory in Traditional Arizona. The petitions, signed in Tucson and Mesilla, were rejected by the United States government but accepted by the Confederates. Confederate Arizona Territory south of the 34th parallel was created but did not become official until the First Battle of Mesilla in July 1861. The Apache took advantage of the withdrawal of Union troops. By then Mangas and Cochise had increased their raids and attacks on settlements so Confederate reinforcements were eventually sent to the area. Fort Tubac was besieged in August 1861 and abandoned again along with the Tumacacori mission. This left Mesilla, New Mexico and Tucson as the only major settlements in southern New Mexico Territory. Tubac's surviving populace was rescued by Tucson militia under Captain Granville H. Oury. The survivors left for Mesilla just after only to be attacked again in Cookes Canyon. Many of the male Tubacan refugees became militiamen in the Arizona Rangers and the Arizona Guards. From 1861 to 1863, several other towns were attacked by Apaches but they were usually defeated by minutemen, Confederate or Union forces. A company of Confederates under Captain Sherod Hunter reinforced the militia of Tucson in late April 1862 and held a flag raising ceremony on May 1. The company was composed primarily of militia from Doña Ana, the Arizona Rangers, of which men from Tubac had joined after escaping their town a year earlier. The rest included Texas cavalrymen, the company counted to about seventy-five men. A major Apache attack on Tucson is believed to have been thwarted due to the arrival of Captain Hunter's company.\nWith such a limited force of men, Hunter had orders to establish an alliance with the Native Americans in the region, particularly the Pimas. He also was directed to observe the advance of the California Column under James H. Carleton which had already begun their invasion of Confederate Arizona. Hunter dispatched several parties on foraging missions, they skirmished with Apaches twice in the Dragoon Mountains, and he sent a request to his superiors for more reinforcements. Other squads were sent to burn the Butterfield Overland Mail stations along the trail west where the Californians were advancing from. Before the Californian advance, a Union spy purchased several thousand pounds of grain and food. It was stored in the abandoned mail stations and was intended to be used by the California Column. A rebel squad under First Lieutenant Jack Swilling burned Union supplies at Stanwix Station on March 30, 1862, and skirmished with the Californians. At this time, Swilling had founded what later became Arizona's state capital of Phoenix. Rebels later fought the Battle of Picacho Pass just north of Tucson as the Union army approached the presidio. The Picacho Pass skirmish delayed Union forces for weeks after they retreated north. Finally, Union troops captured the undefended Fort Breckenridge to the northeast of Tucson and then attacked the city. The same day, the Union began their advance on Tucson. Sherod Hunter, with only about 100 men withdrew from Tucson due to the lack of reinforcements which never arrived. He left ten militiamen and Lieutenant James Henry Tevis behind to observe the Union attack. Confederate Tucson was captured without a shot fired, on May 20, 1862. James H. Carleton and his 2,000 men took command of the presidio, and the Confederates escaped to Mesilla. The Union column moved on a week or so later, and Carleton left a small garrison behind to occupy the rebel city. In 1863, with the help of Arizona's founding father, Charles D. Poston, Union Arizona Territory was created and Tucson became the capital. After the Civil War, the fortress would no longer play a direct role in warfare, though the presidio walls would continue to serve as sought-out refuge by settlers until Geronimo's surrender in 1886. Fort Lowell was built adjacent to Tucson in 1873 and became a major army post. With the end of the Apache threat, the Tucson area was rendered peaceful and the fort unnecessary.\nFrom the 1860s to 1890s Tucson would become a major stop for United States armies on campaigns to fight the Apache, hundreds of Tucson militia served in the expeditions. By the Mexican Revolution of 1910, the next war fought in southern Arizona, only one portion of the remaining four presidio walls still stood, the others were apparently buried or demolished for new development around the turn of the 20th century. The wall was three feet thick and a few feet tall. It stood in between two later American buildings and was finally destroyed in 1918. A pair of local women made a plaque which marked the location of the wall. In December 1954, a two-story boarding house was torn down to make way for a parking lot. A local business man convinced the University of Arizona to conduct an archaeological excavation. They located a 3-foot-thick (0.91 m) portion of the northeastern bastion. Attempts to have the area made into a park failed, and the parking lot was constructed. The area was explored again by archaeologists between 2001 and 2006. Presidio-era features located included the northeastern bastion, the east wall, soil mining pits, and trash-filled pits. Following the work, the northeastern corner of the fort was recreated as a park, opening in 2007. Other surviving portions of the Presidio have been located in the Pima County Courthouse courtyard and in the lawn west of Tucson City Hall.\n## Museum highlights\nPresidio San Agustin del Tucson Museum Presidio Tucson Museum, portion of a mural by Bill Singleton, 1972 Presidio Tucson Museum, Married Men’s Quarters Presidio Tucson Museum, Single Men’s Quarters The Tucson presidio solder as depicted by Bill Singleton in his mural, 1972.

{"name": "Greenmount, Western Australia", "documents": ["# Greenmount, Western Australia\nGreenmount is a locality and a geographical feature in the Shire of Mundaring, Western Australia, on the edge of the Darling Scarp. It is a vital point in the transport routes from the Swan Coastal Plain into the hinterland of Western Australia.\n## Early colonial history\nEnsign Robert Dale reached the summit on 18 October 1829. John Septimus Roe communicated with Dale over the York Road he had used the name Green Mount.\nIn the era of the Swan River Colony the name \"Greenmount\" was used for two points on the Darling Scarp. In the 1840s the York Road was known as York Greenmount, and the road further north along the Scarp was known as Toodyay Greenmount. It is possible that these two locations might have had slightly different coloured foliage compared to the grey blue green colour of the Scarp.\nDuring the convict era, in 1854 Edward Du Cane was the supervisor of the building of a convict depot on the slopes of the hill. In the 1870s a government bluestone quarry was developed on the western slope of the hill.\n## Chippers Leap\nChippers Leap is a memorial stone on the northern edge of the Great Eastern Highway between the two points where the Old York Road remains linking with the highway.\n## Highway\nGreenmount Hill, either by Old York Road or Great Eastern Highway, is the main ascent to, or descent from the Darling Scarp, and has been a regular site of vehicle breakdowns or accidents due to the slope.\nDue to a large increase of heavy truck traffic using the hill, the truck arrester bed located at the lower end of the hill has been in place since an accident in 1993.\n## Railway\nOn its western slopes and southern slopes the original Eastern Railway route travelled. On its western slopes and just to the north the later National Park deviation ran. The current railway route still passes within a few kilometres to the west and north of the hill. Greenmount was a railway stopping place until 1954 when the Mundaring Loop was closed for passenger traffic, however trains continued to work on the line to the Mountain Quarry in Boya until 1962.\n## Quarries\nOn its western slope and near its southern slope it has three unused quarries: Greenmount Quarry, Mountain Quarry, and Hudman Road Quarry. Greenmount Quarry was known as the \"Blue Stone Quarry\" in the 1870s, and was later associated in the late nineteenth century with Alexander Forrest. Mountain Quarry was a working quarry from the 1920s until the early 1960s. It is now a dedicated abseiling location, and is often designated as \"Boya Quarry\". Hudman Road Quarry has in the past been known as Mr O'Connor's quarry, the Fremantle Harbour Works Darlington Quarry, the Public Works Quarry, and the Government Quarry.\nDue to its visibility and lack of development on the hill, it has remained \"green\" since its naming in the 1820s. It has attracted the interest of some artists and photographers. The only spoiling is the front part of the hill (locally known as \"Sugarloaf\"), which was a pasture for over 60 years, and has a \"green\" that is not the endemic green of the jarrah forest that once covered the hill. Also bisection by a Western Power line across the hill, which corresponds with the old border of the Greenmount National Park, has created an eyesore, as well as a serious point of erosion.\nIt has also been the site of aircraft warning lights, since removed, and currently has a police communication tower on the western edge. It also has a mobile telephone tower with Optus and Telstra equipment near Padbury Road. Road access through the Greenmount National Park has been closed due to vandalism, except where permission and keys have been obtained from the Department of Environment and Conservation regional office in Mundaring.\nThe Greenmount locality is bisected by the Great Eastern Highway and other important roads.\n## Undercliffe\nUndercliffe estate, located at Coongan Ave, Greenmount is a Western Australia Government heritage listed site The original land parcel was south of the York Road and near what is now Wortley Road. It sits on an elevated site looking south over the former railway reserve and towards Helena Valley. In 1897, the estate was owned by Edmund Gilyard Lacey, who also owned a nearby sawmill, brickworks and granite quarry. He later sold it to his son-in-law, Percy Ford Robinson. In 1902, Robinson built Undercliffe House, an example of Australian Federation Queen Anne architecture, using the bricks from his father-in-law's quarry. The front entry door is surrounded by stained glass and highlights, which incorporates the name \"Undercliffe\" into its design, and the side panels contain the initials of Robinson.\nDuring the Great Depression, Undercliffe House was used as a parish poorhouse eventually being donated to the Rev John Bell in 1937, which he then converted into a convalescent home. In World War II it housed convalescing soldiers. After the war, it was used as a nursing home, and continued in this capacity until 1981 when it was developed into a hospital. The facilities were upgraded and new buildings added for an additional nursing home, maternity wing and specialist consulting rooms.\nIn the early 20th century, the grounds and garden of the estate were an attraction to artists, train travellers and motorists. The substantial gardens remain in the large spaces between the buildings, together with some significant trees from the original garden. These include a large Moreton Bay fig tree, a Tree Society heritage-listed rare South American cyprus, a Norfolk pine, and several old date palms.\n## Mundaring Municipal Inventory\nThe Shire of Mundaring Municipal Inventory has Greenmount Hill – as a landmark – with high aesthetic, social, historic and scientific significance."], "selected_questions": ["What is the significance of Greenmount in the transport routes of Western Australia?", "When did Ensign Robert Dale reach the summit of Greenmount?", "Which railway routes ran on the western and southern slopes of Greenmount?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The significance of Greenmount in the transport routes of Western Australia is that it is a vital point in the transport routes from the Swan Coastal Plain into the hinterland of Western Australia.

Lying immediately to the west of the city centre, it has played an important role in the city's history. In the 1990s, it became known for its high levels of pollution.\n## History\nLocal tradition states that the first settlement in the area was established by the Onamorokor We hunters, on the east bank of the lagoon. The lagoon was believed to be inhabited by a spirit, who used its powers to enchant a woman named Dede, and used her to convince the group to settle in the location, in order to worship the spirit. The land became the property of the Korle We, and it was a matter of dispute whether this was the same group as the Onamorokor We. The settlement grew into Jamestown, now the western part of the city centre, and was an important source of fish until the 1950s.\n## Post-history\nIn 1961, the Government of Ghana assumed ownership of the lagoon. It dredged the water body and raised the level of some nearby land, to reduce the risk of flooding, then established industries on surrounding drained and reclaimed land—initially brewing and food processing, later car repairs and then electronic scrap processing at Agbogbloshie.\nThe lagoon links to the Gulf of Guinea. It was fed by the Odaw River, which flows through the suburbs of Accra, its catchment area covering 60% of the city. The most important destination of stormwater runoff, the river also became highly polluted with waste, which was discharged into the lagoon. The combination of waste from the Odaw River and industries and settlements on the shores of the lagoon led, by 2002, to it being described as \"one of the most polluted water bodies on earth\". At times of heavy rainfall, it was also flooding nearby areas.\nIn the 1990s, the government established the Korle Lagoon Ecological Restoration Project, aiming to restore the lagoon to a more natural state, reduce pollution, and increase water flow through it. Around this time, the unplanned settlement of Old Fadama was established on the banks of the lagoon, its population peaking at around 30,000. The government announced its intention to clear the area, which it believed was a source of pollution, but following protests, this did not take place.

{"name": "Castles in Great Britain and Ireland", "documents": ["# Castles in Great Britain and Ireland\nCastles have played an important military, economic and social role in Great Britain and Ireland since their introduction following the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Although a small number of castles had been built in England in the 1050s, the Normans began to build motte and bailey and ringwork castles in large numbers to control their newly occupied territories in England and the Welsh Marches. During the 12th century the Normans began to build more castles in stone – with characteristic square keep – that played both military and political roles. Royal castles were used to control key towns and the economically important forests, while baronial castles were used by the Norman lords to control their widespread estates. David I invited Anglo-Norman lords into Scotland in the early 12th century to help him colonise and control areas of his kingdom such as Galloway; the new lords brought castle technologies with them and wooden castles began to be established over the south of the kingdom. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 1170s, under Henry II, castles were established there too.\nCastles continued to grow in military sophistication and comfort during the 12th century, leading to a sharp increase in the complexity and length of sieges in England. While in Ireland and Wales castle architecture continued to follow that of England, after the death of Alexander III the trend in Scotland moved away from the construction of larger castles towards the use of smaller tower houses. The tower house style would also be adopted in the north of England and Ireland in later years. In North Wales Edward I built a sequence of militarily powerful castles after the destruction of the last Welsh polities in the 1270s. By the 14th century castles were combining defences with luxurious, sophisticated living arrangements and heavily landscaped gardens and parks.\nMany royal and baronial castles were left to decline, so that by the 15th century only a few were maintained for defensive purposes. A small number of castles in England and Scotland were developed into Renaissance Era palaces that hosted lavish feasts and celebrations amid their elaborate architecture. Such structures were, however, beyond the means of all but royalty and the richest of the late-medieval barons. Although gunpowder weapons were used to defend castles from the late 14th century onwards it became clear during the 16th century that, provided artillery could be transported and brought to bear on a besieged castle, gunpowder weapons could also play an important attack role. The defences of coastal castles around the British Isles were improved to deal with this threat, but investment in their upkeep once again declined at the end of the 16th century. Nevertheless, in the widespread civil and religious conflicts across the British Isles during the 1640s and 1650s, castles played a key role in England. Modern defences were quickly built alongside existing medieval fortifications and, in many cases, castles successfully withstood more than one siege. In Ireland the introduction of heavy siege artillery by Oliver Cromwell in 1649 brought a rapid end to the utility of castles in the war, while in Scotland the popular tower houses proved unsuitable for defending against civil war artillery – although major castles such as Edinburgh put up strong resistance. At the end of the war many castles were slighted to prevent future use.\nMilitary use of castles rapidly decreased over subsequent years, although some were adapted for use by garrisons in Scotland and key border locations for many years to come, including during the Second World War. Other castles were used as county gaols, until parliamentary legislation in the 19th closed most of them down. For a period in the early 18th century, castles were shunned in favour of Palladian architecture, until they re-emerged as an important cultural and social feature of England, Wales and Scotland and were frequently \"improved\" during the 18th and 19th centuries. Such renovations raised concerns over their protection so that today castles across the British Isles are safeguarded by legislation. Primarily used as tourist attractions, castles form a key part of the national heritage industry. Historians and archaeologists continue to develop our understanding of British castles, while vigorous academic debates in recent years have questioned the interpretation of physical and documentary material surrounding their original construction and use.\n## Norman Invasion\n### Anglo-Saxon fortifications\nThe English word \"castle\" derives from the Latin word castellum and is used to refer to the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. The presence of castles in Britain and Ireland dates primarily from the Norman invasion of 1066. Before the arrival of the Normans the Anglo-Saxons had built burhs, fortified structures with their origins in 9th-century Wessex. Most of these, especially in urban areas, were large enough to be best described as fortified townships rather than private dwellings and are therefore not usually classed as castles. Rural burhs were smaller and usually consisted of a wooden hall with a wall enclosing various domestic buildings along with an entrance tower called a burh-geat, which was apparently used for ceremonial purposes. Although rural burhs were relatively secure their role was primarily ceremonial and they too are not normally classed as castles. There were, however, a small number of castles which were built in England during the 1050s, probably by Norman knights in the service of Edward the Confessor. These include Hereford, Clavering, Richard's Castle and possibly Ewyas Harold Castle and Dover.\n### Invasion\nWilliam, Duke of Normandy, invaded England in 1066 and one of his first actions after landing was to build Hastings Castle to protect his supply routes. Following their victory at the battle of Hastings the Normans began three phases of castle building. The first of these was the establishment, by the new king, of a number of royal castles in key strategic locations. This royal castle programme focused on controlling the towns and cities of England and the associated lines of communication, including Cambridge, Huntingdon, Lincoln, Norwich, Nottingham, Wallingford, Warwick and York. Of the castles built by William the Conqueror two-thirds were built in towns and cities, often those with the former Anglo-Saxon mints. These urban castles could make use of the existing town's walls and fortifications, but typically required the demolition of local houses to make space for them. This could cause extensive damage, and records suggest that in Lincoln 166 houses were destroyed, with 113 in Norwich and 27 in Cambridge. Some of these castles were deliberately built on top of important local buildings, such as the burhs or halls of local nobles, and might be constructed so as to imitate aspects of the previous buildings – such as the gatehouse at Rougemont Castle in Exeter, which closely resembled the previous Anglo-Saxon burh tower – this was probably done to demonstrate to the local population that they now answered to their new Norman rulers.\nThe second and third waves of castle building were led by the major magnates, and then by the more junior knights on their new estates. The apportionment of the conquered lands by the king influenced where these castles were built. In a few key locations the king gave his followers compact groups of estates including the six rapes of Sussex and the three earldoms of Chester, Shrewsbury and Hereford; intended to protect the line of communication with Normandy and the Welsh border respectively. In these areas a baron's castles were clustered relatively tightly together, but in most of England the nobles' estates, and therefore their castles, were more widely dispersed. As the Normans pushed on into South Wales they advanced up the valleys building castles as they went and often using the larger castles of the neighbouring earldoms as a base.\nAs a result, castle building by the Norman nobility across England and the Marches lacked a grand strategic plan, reflecting local circumstances such as military factors and the layout of existing estates and church lands. Castles were often situated along the old Roman roads that still formed the backbone for travel across the country, both to control the lines of communication and to ensure easy movement between different estates. Many castles were built close to inland river ports and those built on the coast were usually located at the mouths of rivers or in ports, Pevensey and Portchester being rare exceptions. Some groups of castles were located so as to be mutually reinforcing – for example the castles of Littledean Camp, Glasshouse Woods and Howle Hill Camp were intended to act as an integrated defence for the area around Gloucester and Gloucester Castle for Gloucester city itself, while Windsor was one of a ring of castles built around London, each approximately a day's march apart. Some regional patterns in castle building can also be seen – relatively few castles were built in East Anglia compared to the west of England or the Marches; this was probably due to the relatively settled and prosperous nature of the east of England and reflected a shortage of available serfs, or unfree labour.\nNot all of the castles were occupied simultaneously. Some were built during the invasions and then abandoned while other new castles were constructed elsewhere, especially along the western borders. Recent estimates suggest that between 500 and 600 castles were occupied at any one time in the post-conquest period.\n### Architecture\nThere was a large degree of variation in the size and exact shape of the castles built in England and Wales after the invasion. One popular form was the motte and bailey, in which earth would be piled up into a mound (called a motte) to support a wooden tower, and a wider enclosed area built alongside it (called a bailey); Stafford Castle is a typical example of a post-invasion motte castle. Another widespread design was the ring work in which earth would be built up in a circular or oval shape and topped with a wooden rampart; Folkestone Castle is a good example of a Norman ring work, in this case built on top of a hill although most post-invasion castles were usually sited on lower ground. Around 80 per cent of Norman castles in this period followed the motte-and-bailey pattern, but ring works were particularly popular in certain areas, such as south-west England and south Wales. One theory put forward to explain this variation is that ringworks were easier to build in these shallow-soil areas than the larger mottes.\nThe White Tower in London and the keep of Colchester Castle were the only stone castles to be built in England immediately after the conquest, both with the characteristic square Norman keep. Both these castles were built in the Romanesque style and were intended to impress as well as provide military protection. In Wales the first wave of the Norman castles were again made of wood, in a mixture of motte-and-bailey and ringwork designs, with the exception of the stone built Chepstow Castle. Chepstow too was heavily influenced by Romanesque design, reusing numerous materials from the nearby Venta Silurum to produce what historian Robert Liddiard has termed \"a play upon images from Antiquity\".\nThe size of these castles varied depending on the geography of the site, the decisions of the builder and the available resources. Analysis of the size of mottes has shown some distinctive regional variation; East Anglia, for example, saw much larger mottes being built than the Midlands or London. While motte-and-bailey and ring-work castles took great effort to build, they required relatively few skilled craftsmen allowing them to be raised using forced labour from the local estates; this, in addition to the speed with which they could be built – a single season, made them particularly attractive immediately after the conquest. The larger earthworks, particularly mottes, required an exponentially greater quantity of manpower than their smaller equivalents and consequently tended to be either royal, or belong to the most powerful barons who could muster the required construction effort. Despite motte-and-bailey and ringworks being common designs amongst Norman castles, each fortification was slightly different – some castles were designed with two baileys attached to a single motte, and some ring works were built with additional towers added on; yet other castles were built as ringworks and later converted to motte-and-bailey structures.\n## 12th century\n### Developments in castle design\nFrom the early 12th century onwards the Normans began to build new castles in stone and convert existing timber designs. This was initially a slow process, picking up speed towards the second half of the century. Traditionally this transition was believed to have been driven by the more crude nature of wooden fortifications, the limited life of timber in wooden castles and its vulnerability to fire; recent archaeological studies have however shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as complex as their stone equivalents. Some wooden castles were not converted into stone for many years and instead expanded in wood, such as at Hen Domen.\nSeveral early stone keeps had been built after the conquest, with somewhere between ten and fifteen in existence by 1100, and more followed in the 12th century until around 100 had been built by 1216. Typically these were four sided designs with the corners reinforced by pilaster buttresses. Keeps were up to four storeys high, with the entrance on the first storey to prevent the door from being easily broken down. The strength of the design typically came from the thickness of the walls: usually made of rag-stone, as in the case of Dover Castle, these walls could be up to 24 feet (7.3 metres) thick. The larger keeps were subdivided by an internal wall while the smaller versions, such as that at Goodrich, had a single, slightly cramped chamber on each floor. Stone keeps required skilled craftsmen to build them; unlike unfree labour or serfs, these men had to be paid and stone keeps were therefore expensive. They were also relatively slow to erect – a keep's walls could usually only be raised by a maximum of 12 feet (3.7 metres) a year, the keep at Scarborough was typical in taking ten years to build.\nNorman stone keeps played both a military and a political role. Most of the keeps were physically extremely robust and, while they were not designed as an intended location for the final defence of a castle, they were often placed near weak points in the walls to provide supporting fire. Many keeps made compromises to purely military utility: Norwich Castle included elaborate blind arcading on the outside of the building, in a Roman style, and appears to had a ceremonial entrance route; The interior of the keep at Hedingham could have hosted impressive ceremonies and events, but contained numerous flaws from a military perspective. Similarly there has been extensive debate over the role of Orford Castle whose expensive, three-cornered design most closely echoes imperial Byzantine palaces and may have been intended by Henry II to be more symbolic than military in nature.\nAnother improvement from the 12th century onwards was the creation of shell keeps, involving replacing the wooden keep on the motte with a circular stone wall. Buildings could be built around the inside of the shell, producing a small inner courtyard. Restormel Castle is a classic example of this development with a perfectly circular wall and a square entrance tower while the later Launceston Castle, although more ovoid than circular, is another good example of the design and one of the most formidable castles of the period. Round castles were unusually popular throughout Cornwall and Devon. Although the circular design held military advantages, these only really mattered in the 13th century onwards; the origins of 12th-century circular design were the circular design of the mottes; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that at Windsor Castle.\n### Economy and society\nEnglish castles during the period were divided into those royal castles owned by the king, and baronial castles controlled by the Anglo-Norman lords. According to chronicler William of Newburgh royal castles formed the \"bones of the kingdom\". A number of royal castles were also designated as shrieval castles, forming the administrative hub for a particular county – for example Winchester Castle served as the centre of Hampshire. These castles formed a base for the royal sheriff, responsible for enforcing royal justice in the relevant shire; the role of the sheriff became stronger and clearer as the century progressed.\nA number of royal castles were linked to forests and other key resources. Royal forests in the early medieval period were subject to special royal jurisdiction; forest law was, as historian Robert Huscroft describes it, \"harsh and arbitrary, a matter purely for the King's will\" and forests were expected to supply the king with hunting grounds, raw materials, goods and money. Forests were typically tied to castles, both to assist with the enforcement of the law and to store the goods being extracted from the local economy: Peveril Castle was linked to the Peak Forest and the local lead mining there; St Briavels was tied to the Forest of Dean; and Knaresborough, Rockingham and Pickering to their eponymous forests respectively. In the south-west, where the Crown oversaw the lead mining industry, castles such as Restormel played an important role running the local stannery courts.\nBaronial castles were of varying size and sophistication; some were classed as a caput, or the key stronghold of a given lord, and were usually larger and better fortified than the norm and usually held the local baronial honorial courts. The king continued to exercise the right to occupy and use any castle in the kingdom in response to external threats, in those cases he would staff the occupied castles with his own men; the king also retained the right to authorise the construction of new castles through the issuing of licenses to crenellate. It was possible for bishops to build or control castles, such as the important Devizes Castle linked to the Bishop of Salisbury, although this practice was challenged on occasion. In the 12th century the practice of castle-guards emerged in England and Wales, under which lands were assigned to local lords on condition that the recipient provided a certain number of knights or sergeants for the defence of a named castle. In some cases, such as at Dover, this arrangement became quite sophisticated with particular castle towers being named after particular families owing castle-guard duty.\nThe links between castles and the surrounding lands and estates was particularly important during this period. Many castles, both royal and baronial, had deer parks or chases attached to them for the purposes of hunting. These usually stretched away from the village or borough associated with the castle, but occasionally a castle was placed in the centre of a park, such as at Sandal.\n### The Anarchy\nCivil war broke out in England and raged between 1139 and 1153, forming a turbulent period in which the rival factions of King Stephen and the Empress Matilda struggled for power. Open battles were relatively rare during the war, with campaigns instead centred on a sequence of raids and sieges as commanders attempted to gain control over the vital castles that controlled the territory in the rival regions. Siege technology during the Anarchy centred on basic stone-throwing machines such as ballistae and mangonels, supported by siege towers and mining, combined with blockade and, occasionally, direct assault. The phase of the conflict known as \"the Castle War\" saw both sides attempting to defeat each other through sieges, such as Stephen's attempts to take Wallingford, the most easterly fortress in Matilda's push towards London, or Geoffrey de Mandeville's attempts to seize East Anglia by taking Cambridge Castle.\nBoth sides responded to the challenge of the conflict by building many new castles, sometimes as sets of strategic fortifications. In the south-west Matilda's supporters built a range of castles to protect the territory, usually motte and bailey designs such as those at Winchcombe, Upper Slaughter, or Bampton. Similarly, Stephen built a new chain of fen-edge castles at Burwell, Lidgate, Rampton, Caxton, and Swavesey – all about six to nine miles (10–15 km) apart – in order to protect his lands around Cambridge. Many of these castles were termed \"adulterine\" (unauthorised), because no formal permission was given for their construction. Contemporary chroniclers saw this as a matter of concern; Robert of Torigny suggested that as many as 1,115 such castles had been built during the conflict, although this was probably an exaggeration as elsewhere he suggests an alternative figure of 126. Another feature of the war was the creation of many \"counter-castles\". These had been used in English conflicts for several years before the civil war and involved building a basic castle during a siege, alongside the main target of attack. Typically these would be built in either a ringwork or a motte-and-bailey design between 200 and 300 yards (180 and 270 metres) away from the target, just beyond the range of a bow. Counter-castles could be used to either act as firing platforms for siege weaponry, or as bases for controlling the region in their own right. Most counter-castles were destroyed after their use but in some cases the earthworks survived, such as the counter-castles called Jew's Mount and Mount Pelham built by Stephen in 1141 outside Oxford Castle.\nMatilda's son Henry II assumed the throne at the end of the war and immediately announced his intention to eliminate the adulterine castles that had sprung up during the war, but it is unclear how successful this effort was. Robert of Torigny recorded that 375 were destroyed, without giving the details behind the figure; recent studies of selected regions have suggested that fewer castles were probably destroyed than once thought and that many may simply have been abandoned at the end of the conflict. Certainly many of the new castles were transitory in nature: Archaeologist Oliver Creighton observes that 56 per cent of those castles known to have been built during Stephen's reign have \"entirely vanished\".\n### The spread of castles in Scotland, Wales and Ireland\nCastles in Scotland emerged as a consequence of the centralising of royal authority in the 12th century. Prior to the 1120s there is very little evidence of castles having existed in Scotland, which had remained less politically centralised than in England with the north still ruled by the kings of Norway. David I of Scotland spent time at the court of Henry I in the south, until he became the Earl of Huntingdon, and returned to Scotland with the intention of extending royal power across the country and modernising Scotland's military technology, including the introduction of castles. The Scottish king encouraged Norman and French nobles to settle in Scotland, introducing a feudal mode of landholding and the use of castles as a way of controlling the contested lowlands. The quasi-independent polity of Galloway, which had resisted the rule of David and his predecessors, was a particular focus for this colonisation. The size of these Scottish castles, primarily wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, varied considerably from larger designs, such as the Bass of Inverurie, to smaller castles like Balmaclellan. As historian Lise Hull has suggested, the creation of castles in Scotland was \"less to do with conquest\" and more to do with \"establishing a governing system\".\nThe Norman expansion into Wales slowed in the 12th century, but remained an ongoing threat to the remaining native rulers. In response the Welsh princes and lords began to build their own castles, usually in wood. There are indications that this may have begun from 1111 onwards under Prince Cadwgan ap Bleddyn with the first documentary evidence of a native Welsh castle being at Cymmer in 1116. These timber castles, including Tomen y Rhodwydd, Tomen y Faerdre and Gaer Penrhôs, were of equivalent quality to the Norman fortifications in the area and it can prove difficult to distinguish the builders of some sites from the archaeological evidence alone. At the end of the 12th century the Welsh rulers began to build castles in stone, primarily in the principality of North Wales.\nIreland remained ruled by native kings into the 12th century, largely without the use of castles. There was a history of Irish fortifications called ráths, a type of ringfort, some of which were very heavily defended but which are not usually considered to be castles in the usual sense of the word. The kings of Connacht constructed fortifications from 1124 which they called caistel or caislen, from the Latin and French for castle, and there has been considerable academic debate over how far these resembled European castles.\nThe Norman invasion of Ireland began between 1166 and 1171, under first Richard de Clare and then Henry II of England, with the occupation of southern and eastern Ireland by a number of Anglo-Norman barons. The rapid Norman success depended on key economic and military advantages, with castles enabling them to control the newly conquered territories. The new lords rapidly built castles to protect their possessions, many of these were motte-and-bailey constructions; in Louth at least 23 of these were built. It remains uncertain how many ringwork castles were built in Ireland by the Anglo-Normans. Other castles, such as Trim and Carrickfergus, were built in stone as the caput centres for major barons. Analysis of these stone castles suggests that building in stone was not simply a military decision; indeed, several of the castles contain serious defensive flaws. Instead the designs, including their focus on large stone keeps, were intended both to increase the prestige of the baronial owners and to provide adequate space for the administrative apparatus of the new territories. Unlike in Wales the indigenous Irish lords do not appear to have constructed their own castles in any significant number during the period.\n## 13th–14th centuries\n### Military developments\nCastle design in Britain continued to change towards the end of the 12th century. After Henry II mottes ceased to be built in most of England, although they continued to be erected in Wales and along the Marches. Square keeps remained common across much of England in contrast to the circular keeps increasingly prevailing in France; in the Marches, however, circular keep designs became more popular. Castles began to take on a more regular, enclosed shape, ideally quadrilateral or at least polygonal in design, especially in the more prosperous south. Flanking towers, initially square and latterly curved, were introduced along the walls and gatehouses began to grow in size and complexity, with portcullises being introduced for the first time. Castles such as Dover and the Tower of London were expanded in a concentric design in what Cathcart King has labelled the early development of \"scientific fortification\".\nThe developments spread to Anglo-Norman possessions in Ireland where this English style of castles dominated throughout the 13th century, although the deteriorating Irish economy of the 14th century brought this wave of building to an end. In Scotland Alexander II and Alexander III undertook a number of castle building projects in the modern style, although Alexander III's early death sparked conflict in Scotland and English intervention under Edward I in 1296. In the ensuing wars of Scottish Independence castle building in Scotland altered path, turning away from building larger, more conventional castles with curtain walls. The Scots instead adopted the policy of slighting, or deliberately destroying, castles captured in Scotland from the English to prevent their re-use in subsequent invasions – most of the new Scottish castles built by nobles were of the tower house design; the few larger castles built in Scotland were typically royal castles, built on the command of Scottish kings.\nSome of these changes were driven by developments in military technology. Before 1190 mining was used rarely and the siege engines of the time were largely incapable of damaging the thicker castle walls. The introduction of the trebuchet began to change this situation; it was able to throw much heavier balls, with remarkable accuracy, and reconstructed devices have been shown to be able to knock holes in walls. Trebuchets were first recorded in England in 1217, and were probably used the year before as well. Richard I used them in his sieges during the Third Crusade and appears to have started to alter his castle designs to accommodate the new technology on his return to Europe. The trebuchet seems to have encouraged the shift towards round and polygonal towers and curved walls. In addition to having fewer or no dead zones, and being easier to defend against mining, these castle designs were also much less easy to attack with trebuchets as the curved surfaces could deflect some of the force of the shot.\nCastles saw an increasing use of arrowslits by the 13th century, especially in England, almost certainly linked to the introduction of crossbows. These arrow slits were combined with firing positions from the tops of the towers, initially protected by wooden hoarding until stone machicolations were introduced in England in the late 13th century. The crossbow was an important military advance on the older short bow and was the favoured weapon by the time of Richard I; many crossbows and vast numbers of quarrels were needed to supply royal forces, in turn requiring larger scale iron production. In England, crossbows were primarily made at the Tower of London but St Briavels Castle, with the local Forest of Dean available to provide raw materials, became the national centre for quarrel manufacture. In Scotland, Edinburgh Castle became the centre for the production of bows, crossbows and siege engines for the king.\nOne result of this was that English castle sieges grew in complexity and scale. During the First Barons' War from 1215 to 1217, the prominent sieges of Dover and Windsor Castle showed the ability of more modern designs to withstand attack; King John's successful siege of Rochester required an elaborate and sophisticated assault, reportedly costing around 60,000 marks, or £40,000. The siege of Bedford Castle in 1224 required Henry III to bring siege engines, engineers, crossbow bolts, equipment and labourers from across all of England. The Siege of Kenilworth Castle in 1266, during the Second Barons' War, was larger and longer still. Extensive water defences withstood the attack of the future Edward I, despite the prince targeting the weaker parts of the castle walls, employing huge siege towers and attempting a night attack using barges brought from Chester. The costs of the siege exhausted the revenues of ten English counties. Sieges in Scotland were initially smaller in scale, with the first recorded such event being the 1230 siege of Rothesay Castle where the besieging Norwegians were able to break down the relatively weak stone walls with axes after only three days. When Edward I invaded Scotland he brought with him the siege capabilities which had evolved south of the border: Edinburgh Castle fell within three days, and Roxburgh, Jedburgh, Dunbar, Stirling, Lanark and Dumbarton castles surrendered to the king. Subsequent English sieges, such as the attacks on Bothwell and Stirling, again used considerable resources including giant siege engines and extensive teams of miners and masons.\n### Economy and society\nA number of royal castles, from the 12th century onwards, formed an essential network of royal storehouses in the 13th century for a wide range of goods including food, drink, weapons, armour and raw materials. Castles such as Southampton, Winchester, Bristol and the Tower of London were used to import, store and distribute royal wines. The English royal castles also became used as gaols – the Assize of Clarendon in 1166 insisted that royal sheriffs establish their own gaols and, in the coming years, county gaols were placed in all the shrieval royal castles. Conditions in these gaols were poor and claims of poor treatment and starvation were common; Northampton Castle appears to have seen some of the worst abuses.\nThe development of the baronial castles in England were affected by the economic changes during the period. During the 13th and 14th centuries the average incomes of the English barons increased but wealth became concentrated in the hands of a smaller number of individuals, with a greater discrepancy in incomes. At the same time the costs of maintaining and staffing a modern castle were increasing. The result was that although there were around 400 castles in England in 1216, the number of castles continued to diminish over the coming years; even the wealthier barons were inclined to let some castles slide into disuse and to focus their resources on the remaining stock. The castle-guard system faded into abeyance in England, being replaced by financial rents, although it continued in the Welsh Marches well into the 13th century and saw some limited use during Edward I's occupation of Scotland in the early 14th century.\nThe remaining English castles became increasingly comfortable. Their interiors were often painted and decorated with tapestries, which would be transported from castle to castle as nobles travelled around the country. There were an increasing number of garderobes built inside castles, while in the wealthier castles the floors could be tiled and the windows furnished with Sussex Weald glass, allowing the introduction of window seats for reading. Food could be transported to castles across relatively long distances; fish was brought to Okehampton Castle from the sea some 25 miles (40 km) away, for example. Venison remained the most heavily consumed food in most castles, particularly those surrounded by extensive parks or forests such as Barnard Castle, while prime cuts of venison were imported to those castles that lacked hunting grounds, such as Launceston.\nBy the late 13th century some castles were built within carefully \"designed landscapes\", sometimes drawing a distinction between an inner core of a herber, a small enclosed garden complete with orchards and small ponds, and an outer region with larger ponds and high status buildings such as \"religious buildings, rabbit warrens, mills and settlements\", potentially set within a park. A gloriette, or a suite of small rooms, might be built within the castle to allow the result to be properly appreciated, or a viewing point constructed outside. At Leeds Castle the redesigned castle of the 1280s was placed within a large water garden, while at Ravensworth at the end of the 14th century an artificial lake was enclosed by a park to produce an aesthetically and symbolically pleasing entrance to the fortification. The wider parklands and forests were increasingly managed and the proportion of the smaller fallow deer consumed by castle inhabitants in England increased as a result.\n### Welsh castles\nDuring the 13th century the native Welsh princes built a number of stone castles. The size of these varied considerably from smaller fortifications, such as Dinas Emrys in Snowdonia, to more substantial castles like Dinefwr and the largest, Castell y Bere. Native Welsh castles typically maximised the defensive benefits of high, mountainous sites, often being built in an irregular shape to fit a rocky peak. Most had deep ditches cut out of the rock to protect the main castle. The Welsh castles were usually built with a relatively short keep, used as living accommodation for princes and nobility, and with distinctive 'apsidal' D-shaped towers along the walls. In comparison to Norman castles the gatehouses were much weaker in design, with almost no use of portcullises or spiral staircases, and the stonework of the outer walls was also generally inferior to Norman built castles. The later native Welsh castles, built in the 1260s, more closely resemble Norman designs; including round towers and, in the case of Criccieth and Dinas Brân, twin-towered gatehouse defences.\n### Edward I's castles in Wales\nIn 1277 Edward I launched a final invasion of the remaining native Welsh strongholds in North Wales, intending to establish his rule over the region on a permanent basis. As part of this occupation he instructed his leading nobles to construct eight new castles across the region; Aberystwyth and Builth in mid-Wales and Beaumaris, Conwy, Caernarfon, Flint, Harlech and Rhuddlan Castle in North Wales. Historian R. Allen Brown has described these as \"amongst the finest achievements of medieval military architecture \". The castles varied in design but were typically characterised by powerful mural towers along the castle walls, with multiple, over-lapping firing points and large and extremely well defended barbicans. The castles were intended to be used by the king when in the region and included extensive high-status accommodation. Edward also established various new English towns, and in several cases the new castles were designed to be used alongside the fortified town walls as part of an integrated defence. Historian Richard Morris has suggested that \"the impression is firmly given of an elite group of men-of-war, long-standing comrades in arms of the king, indulging in an orgy of military architectural expression on an almost unlimited budget\".\nJames of Saint George, a famous architect and engineer from Savoy, was probably responsible for the bulk of the construction work across the region. The castles were extremely costly to build and required labourers, masons, carpenters, diggers, and building resources to be gathered by local sheriffs from across England, mustered at Chester and Bristol, before being sent on to North Wales in the spring, returning home each winter. The number of workers involved placed a significant drain on the country's national labour force. The total financial cost cannot be calculated with certainty, but estimates suggest that Edward's castle building programme cost at least £80,000 – four times the total royal expenditure on castles between 1154 and 1189.\nThe Edwardian castles also made strong symbolic statements about the nature of the new occupation. For example, Caernarvon was decorated with carved eagles, equipped with polygonal towers and expensive banded masonry, all designed to imitate the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, then the idealised image of imperial power. The actual site of the castle may also have been important as it was positioned close to the former Roman fort of Segontium. The elaborate gatehouse, with an excessive five sets of doors and six portcullises, also appears to have been designed to impress visitors and to invoke an image of an Arthurian castle, then believed to have been Byzantine in character.\n### Palace-fortresses\nIn the middle of the 13th century Henry III began to redesign his favourite castles, including Winchester and Windsor, building larger halls, grander chapels, installing glass windows and decorating the palaces with painted walls and furniture. This marked the beginning of a trend towards the development of grand castles designed for elaborate, elite living. Life in earlier keeps had been focused around a single great hall, with privacy for the owner's family provided by using an upper floor for their own living accommodation. By the 14th century nobles were travelling less, bringing much larger households with them when they did travel and entertaining visitors with equally large retinues. Castles such as Goodrich were redesigned in the 1320s to provide greater residential privacy and comfort for the ruling family, while retaining strong defensive features and a capacity to hold over 130 residents at the castle. The design influenced subsequent conversions at Berkeley and by the time that Bolton Castle was being built, in the 1380s, it was designed to hold up to eight different noble households, each with their own facilities. Royal castles such as Beaumaris, although designed with defence in mind, were designed to hold up to eleven different households at any one time.\nKings and the most wealthy lords could afford to redesign castles to produce palace-fortresses. Edward III spent £51,000 on renovating Windsor Castle; this was over one and a half times Edward's typical annual income. In the words of Steven Brindle the result was a \"great and apparently architecturally unified palace... uniform in all sorts of ways, as to roof line, window heights, cornice line, floor and ceiling heights\", echoing older designs but without any real defensive value. The wealthy John of Gaunt redesigned the heart of Kenilworth Castle, like Windsor the work emphasised a unifying, rectangular design and the separation of ground floor service areas from the upper stories and a contrast of austere exteriors with lavish interiors, especially on the 1st floor of the inner bailey buildings. By the end of the 14th century a distinctive English perpendicular style had emerged.\nIn the south of England private castles were being built by newly emerging, wealthy families; like the work at Windsor, these castles drew on the architectural themes of earlier martial designs, but were not intended to form a serious defence against attack. These new castles were heavily influenced by French designs, involving a rectangular or semi-rectangular castle with corner towers, gatehouses and moat; the walls effectively enclosing a comfortable courtyard plan not dissimilar to that of an unfortified manor. Bodiam Castle built in the 1380s possessed a moat, towers and gunports but, rather than being a genuine military fortification, the castle was primarily intended to be admired by visitors and used as a luxurious dwelling – the chivalric architecture implicitly invoking comparisons with Edward I's great castle at Beaumaris.\nIn the north of England improvements in the security of the Scottish border, and the rise of major noble families such as the Percies and the Nevilles, encouraged a surge in castle building at the end of the 14th century. Palace-fortresses such as Raby, Bolton and Warkworth Castle took the quadrangular castle styles of the south and combined them with exceptionally large key towers or keeps to form a distinctive northern style. Built by major noble houses these castles were typically even more opulent than those built by the nouveau riche of the south. They marked what historian Anthony Emery has described as a \"second peak of castle building in England and Wales\", after the Edwardian designs at the end of the 14th century.\n### Introduction of gunpowder\nEarly gunpowder weapons were introduced to England from the 1320s onwards and began to appear in Scotland by the 1330s. By the 1340s the English Crown was regularly spending money on them and the new technology began to be installed in English castles by the 1360s and 1370s, and in Scottish castles by the 1380s. Cannons were made in various sizes, from smaller hand cannons to larger guns firing stone balls of up to 7.6 inches (19 cm). Medium-sized weapons weighing around 20 kg each were more useful for the defence of castles, although Richard II eventually established 600 pound (272 kilo) guns at the Tower of London and the 15,366 pound (6,970 kilo) heavy Mons Meg bombard was installed at Edinburgh Castle.\nEarly cannons had only a limited range and were unreliable; in addition early stone cannonballs were relatively ineffective when fired at stone castle walls. As a result, early cannon proved most useful for defence, particularly against infantry assaults or to fire at the crews of enemy trebuchets. Indeed, early cannons could be quite dangerous to their own soldiers; James II of Scotland was killed besieging Roxburgh Castle in 1460 when one of his cannons, called \"Lion\", exploded next to him. The expense of early cannons meant that they were primarily a weapon deployed by royalty rather than the nobility.\nCannons in English castles were initially deployed along the south coast where the Channel ports, essential for English trade and military operations in Europe, were increasingly threatened by French raids. Carisbrooke, Corfe, Dover, Portchester, Saltwood and Southampton Castle received cannon during the late 14th century, small circular \"keyhole\" gunports being built in the walls to accommodate the new weapons. Carisbrooke Castle was subject to an unsuccessful French siege in 1377, the Crown reacting by equipping the castle with cannon and a mill for producing gunpowder in 1379. Some further English castles along the Welsh borders and Scotland were similarly equipped, with the Tower of London and Pontefract Castle acting as supply depots for the new weapons. In Scotland the first cannon for a castle appears to have been bought for Edinburgh in 1384, which also became an arsenal for the new devices.\n## 15th–16th centuries\n### Decline of English castles\nBy the 15th century very few castles were well maintained by their owners. Many royal castles were receiving insufficient investment to allow them to be maintained – roofs leaked, stone work crumbled, lead or wood was stolen. The Crown was increasingly selective about which royal castles it maintained, with others left to decay. By the 15th century only Windsor, Leeds, Rockingham and Moor End were kept up as comfortable accommodation; Nottingham and York formed the backbone for royal authority in the north, and Chester, Gloucester and Bristol forming the equivalents in the west. Even major fortifications such as the castles of North Wales and the border castles of Carlisle, Bamburgh and Newcastle upon Tyne saw funding and maintenance reduced. Many royal castles continued to have a role as the county gaol, with the gatehouse frequently being used as the principal facility.\nThe ranks of the baronage continued to reduce in the 15th century, producing a smaller elite of wealthier lords but reducing the comparative wealth of the majority. and many baronial castles fell into similar decline. John Leland's 16th-century accounts of English castles are replete with descriptions of castles being \"sore decayed\", their defences \"in ruine\" or, where the walls might still be in good repair, the \"logginges within\" were \"decayed\". English castles did not play a decisive role during the Wars of the Roses, fought between 1455 and 1485, which were primarily in the form of pitched battles between the rival factions of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists.\n### Renaissance palaces\nThe 15th and 16th centuries saw a small number of British castles develop into still grander structures, often drawing on the Renaissance views on architecture that were increasing in popularity on the continent. Tower keeps, large solid keeps used for private accommodation, probably inspired by those in France had started to appear in the 14th century at Dudley and Warkworth. In the 15th century the fashion spread with the creation of very expensive, French-influenced palatial castles featuring complex tower keeps at Wardour, Tattershall and Raglan Castle. In central and eastern England castles began to be built in brick, with Caister, Kirby Muxloe and Tattershall forming examples of this new style. North of the border the construction of Holyrood Great Tower between 1528 and 1532 picked up on this English tradition, but incorporated additional French influences to produce a highly secure but comfortable castle, guarded by a gun park.\nRoyal builders in Scotland led the way in adopting further European Renaissance styles in castle design. James IV and James V used exceptional one-off revenues, such as the forfeiture of key lands, to establish their power across their kingdom in various ways including constructing grander castles such as Linlithgow, almost invariably by extending and modifying existing fortifications. These Scottish castle palaces drew on Italian Renaissance designs, in particular the fashionable design of a quadrangular court with stair-turrets on each corner, using harling to giving them a clean, Italian appearance. Later the castles drew on Renaissance designs in France, such as the work at Falkland and Stirling Castle. The shift in architectural focus reflected changing political alliances, as James V had formed a close alliance with France during his reign. In the words of architectural historian John Dunbar the results were the \"earliest examples of coherent Renaissance design in Britain\".\nThese changes also included shifts in social and cultural beliefs. The period saw the disintegration of the older feudal order, the destruction of the monasteries and widespread economic changes, altering the links between castles and the surrounding estates. Within castles, the Renaissance saw the introduction of the idea of public and private spaces, placing new value on castles having private spaces for the lord or his guests away from public view. Although the elite in Britain and Ireland continued to maintain and build castles in the style of the late medieval period there was a growing understanding through the Renaissance, absent in the 14th century, that domestic castles were fundamentally different from the military fortifications being built to deal with the spread of gunpowder artillery. Castles continued to be built and reworked in what cultural historian Matthew Johnson has described as a \"conscious attempt to invoke values seen as being under threat\". The results, as at Kenilworth Castle for example, could include huge castles deliberately redesigned to appear old and sporting chivalric features, but complete with private chambers, Italian loggias and modern luxury accommodation.\nAlthough the size of noble households shrank slightly during the 16th century, the number of guests at the largest castle events continued to grow. 2,000 came to a feast at Cawood Castle in 1466, while the Duke of Buckingham routinely entertained up to 519 people at Thornbury Castle at the start of the 16th century. When Elizabeth I visited Kenilworth in 1575 she brought an entourage of 31 barons and 400 staff for a visit that lasted an exceptional 19 days; Leicester, the castle's owner, entertained the Queen and much of the neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. With this scale of living and entertainment the need to find more space in older castles became a major issue in both England and Scotland.\n### Tower houses\nTower houses were a common feature of British and Irish castle building in the late medieval period: over 3,000 were constructed in Ireland, around 800 in Scotland and over 250 in England. A tower house would typically be a tall, square, stone-built, crenelated building; Scottish and Ulster tower houses were often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn, a walled courtyard designed to hold valuable animals securely, but not necessarily intended for serious defence. Many of the gateways in these buildings were guarded with yetts, grill-like doors made out of metal bars. Smaller versions of tower houses in northern England and southern Scotland were known as Peel towers, or pele houses, and were built along both sides of the border regions. In Scotland a number were built in Scottish towns. It was originally argued that Irish tower houses were based on the Scottish design, but the pattern of development of such castles in Ireland does not support this hypothesis.\nThe defences of tower houses were primarily aimed to provide protection against smaller raiding parties and were not intended to put up significant opposition to an organised military assault, leading historian Stuart Reid to characterise them as \"defensible rather than defensive\". Gunports for heavier guns were built into some Scottish tower houses by the 16th century but it was more common to use lighter gunpowder weapons, such as muskets, to defend Scottish tower houses. Unlike Scotland, Irish tower houses were only defended with relatively light handguns and frequently reused older arrowloops, rather than more modern designs, to save money.\nAnalysis of the construction of tower houses has focused on two key driving forces. The first is that the construction of these castles appears to have been linked to periods of instability and insecurity in the areas concerned. In Scotland James IV's forfeiture of the Lordship of the Isles in 1494 led to an immediate burst of castle building across the region and, over the longer term, an increased degree of clan warfare, while the subsequent wars with England in the 1540s added to the level of insecurity over the rest of the century. Irish tower houses were built from the end of the 14th century onward as the countryside disintegrated into the unstable control of a large number of small lordships and Henry VI promoted their construction with financial rewards in a bid to improve security. English tower houses were built along the frontier with Scotland in a dangerous and insecure period. Secondly, and paradoxically, appears to have been the periods of relative prosperity. Contemporary historian William Camden observed of the northern English and the Scots, \"there is not a man amongst them of a better sort that hath not his little tower or pile\", and many tower houses seem to have been built as much as status symbols as defensive structures. Along the English-Scottish borders the construction pattern follows the relative prosperity of the different side: the English lords built tower houses primarily in the early 15th century, when northern England was particularly prosperous, while their Scottish equivalents built them in late 15th and early 16th centuries, boom periods in the economy of Scotland. In Ireland the growth of tower houses during the 15th century mirrors the rise of cattle herding and the resulting wealth that this brought to many of the lesser lords in Ireland.\n### Further development of gunpowder artillery\nCannons continued to be improved during the 15th and 16th centuries. Castle loopholes were adapted to allow cannons and other firearms to be used in a defensive role, but offensively gunpowder weapons still remained relatively unreliable. England had lagged behind Europe in adapting to this new form of warfare; Dartmouth and Kingswear Castles, built in the 1490s to defend the River Dart, and Bayard's Cover, designed in 1510 to defend Dartmouth harbour itself, were amongst the few English castles designed in the continental style during the period, and even these lagged behind the cutting edge of European design. Scottish castles were more advanced in this regard, partially as a result of the stronger French architectural influences. Ravenscraig Castle in Scotland, for example, was an early attempt in the 1460s to deploy a combination of \"letter box\" gun-ports and low-curved stone towers for artillery weapons. These letter box gun-ports, common in mainland Europe, rapidly spread across Scotland but were rarely used in England during the 15th century. Scotland also led the way in adopting the new caponier design for castle ditches, as constructed at Craignethan Castle.\nHenry VIII became concerned with the threat of French invasion during 1539 and was familiar with the more modern continental designs. He responded to the threat by building a famous sequence of forts, called the Device Forts or Henrician Castles, along the south coast of England specifically designed to be equipped with, and to defend against, gunpowder artillery. These forts still lacked some of the more modern continental features, such as angled bastions. Each fort had a slightly different design, but as a group they shared common features, with the fortification formed around a number of compact lobes, often in a quatrefoil or trefoil shape, designed to give the guns a 360-degree angle of fire. The forts were usually tiered to allow the guns to fire over one another and had features such as vents to disperse the gunpowder smoke. It is probable that many of the forts were also originally protected by earth bulwarks, although these have not survived. The resulting forts have been described by historian Christopher Duffy as having \"an air at once sturdy and festive, rather like a squashed wedding cake\".\nThese coastal defences marked a shift away from castles, which were both military fortifications and domestic buildings, towards forts, which were garrisoned but not domestic; often the 1540s are chosen as a transition date for the study of castles as a consequence. The subsequent years also marked almost the end of indigenous English fortification design – by the 1580s English castle improvements were almost entirely dominated by imported European experts. The superiority of Scottish castle design also diminished; the Half Moon battery built at Edinburgh Castle in 1574, for example, was already badly dated in continental terms by the time it was built. The limited number of modern fortifications built in Ireland, such as those with the first gunports retrofitted to Carrickfergus Castle in the 1560s and at Corkbeg in Cork Harbour and built in the 1570s in fear of an invasion, were equally unexceptional by European standards.\nNonetheless, improved gunpowder artillery played a part in the reconquest of Ireland in the 1530s, where the successful English siege of Maynooth Castle in 1530 demonstrated the power of the new siege guns. There were still relatively few guns in Ireland however and, during the Nine Years' War at the end of the century, the Irish were proved relatively unskilled in siege warfare with artillery used mainly by the English. In both Ireland and Scotland the challenge was how to transport artillery pieces to castle sieges; the poor state of Scottish roads required expensive trains of pack horses, which only the king could afford, and in Ireland the river network had to be frequently used to transport the weapons inland. In these circumstances older castles could frequently remain viable defensive features, although the siege of Cahir Castle in 1599 and the attack on Dunyvaig Castle on Islay in 1614 proved that if artillery could be brought to bear, previously impregnable castle walls might fall relatively quickly.\n## 17th century\n### Wars of the Three Kingdoms\nIn 1603 James VI of Scotland inherited the crown of England, bringing a period of peace between the two countries. The royal court left for London and, as a result – with the exceptions of occasional visits, building work on royal castles north of the border largely ceased. Investment in English castles, especially royal castles, declined dramatically. James sold off many royal castles in England to property developers, including York and Southampton Castle. A royal inspection in 1609 highlighted that the Edwardian castles of North Wales, including Conwy, Beaumaris and Caernarfon were \"tterlie decayed\".; a subsequent inspection of various English counties in 1635 found a similar picture: Lincoln, Kendal, York, Nottingham, Bristol, Queenborough, Southampton and Rochester were amongst those in a state of dilapidation. In 1642 one pamphlet described many English castles as \"muche decayed\" and as requiring \"much provision\" for \"warlike defence\". Those maintained as private homes; such as Arundel, Berkeley, Carlisle and Winchester were in much better condition, but not necessarily defendable in a conflict; while some such as Bolsover were redesigned as more modern dwellings in a Palladian style. A handful of coastal forts and castles, amongst them Dover Castle, remained in good military condition with adequate defences.\nIn 1642 the English Civil War broke out, initially between supporters of Parliament and the Royalist supporters of Charles I. The war expanded to include Ireland and Scotland, and dragged on into three separate conflicts in England itself. The war was the first prolonged conflict in Britain to involve the use of artillery and gunpowder. English castles were used for various purposes during the conflict. York Castle formed a key part of the city defences, with a military governor; rural castles such as Goodrich could be used a bases for raiding and for control of the surrounding countryside; larger castles, such as Windsor, became used for holding prisoners of war or as military headquarters. During the war castles were frequently brought back into fresh use: existing defences would be renovated, while walls would be \"countermured\", or backed by earth, in order to protect from cannons. Towers and keeps were filled with earth to make gun platforms, such as at Carlisle and Oxford Castle. New earth bastions could be added to existing designs, such as at Cambridge and Carew Castle and at the otherwise unfortified Basing House the surrounding Norman ringwork was brought back into commission. The costs could be considerable, with the work at Skipton Castle coming to over £1000.\nSieges became a prominent part of the war with over 300 occurring during the period, many of them involving castles. Indeed, as Robert Liddiard suggests, the \"military role of some castles in the seventeenth century is out of all proportion to their medieval histories\". Artillery formed an essential part of these sieges, with the \"characteristic military action\" according to military historian Stephen Bull, being \"an attack on a fortified strongpoint\" supported by artillery. The ratio of artillery pieces to defenders varied considerably in sieges, but in all cases there were more guns than in previous conflicts; up to one artillery piece for every nine defenders was not unknown in extreme cases, such as near Pendennis Castle. The growth in the number and size of siege artillery favoured those who had the resources to purchase and deploy these weapons. Artillery had improved by the 1640s but was still not always decisive, as the lighter cannon of the period found it hard to penetrate earth and timber bulwarks and defences – demonstrated in the siege of Corfe. Mortars, able to lob fire over the taller walls, proved particularly effective against castles – in particular those more compact ones with smaller courtyards and open areas, such as at Stirling Castle.\nThe heavy artillery introduced in England eventually spread to the rest of the British Isles. Although up to a thousand Irish soldiers who had served in Europe returned during the war, bringing with them experience of siege warfare from the Thirty Years' War in Europe, it was the arrival of Oliver Cromwell's train of siege guns in 1649 that transformed the conflict, and the fate of local castles. None of the Irish castles could withstand these Parliamentary weapons and most quickly surrendered. In 1650 Cromwell invaded Scotland and again his heavily artillery proved decisive.\n### The Restoration\nThe English Civil War resulted in Parliament issuing orders to slight or damage many castles, particularly in prominent royal regions. This was particularly in the period of 1646 to 1651, with a peak in 1647. Around 150 fortifications were slighted in this period, including 38 town walls and a great many castles. Slighting was quite expensive and took some considerable effort to carry out, so damage was usually done in the most cost-effective fashion with only selected walls being destroyed. In some cases the damage was almost total, such as Wallingford Castle or Pontefract Castle which had been involved in three major sieges and in this case at the request of the townsfolk who wished to avoid further conflict.\nBy the time that Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660, the major palace-fortresses in England that had survived slighting were typically in a poor state. As historian Simon Thurley has described, the shifting \"functional requirements, patterns of movement, modes of transport, aesthetic taste and standards of comfort\" amongst royal circles were also changing the qualities being sought in a successful castle. Palladian architecture was growing in popularity, which sat awkwardly with the typical design of a medieval castle. Furthermore, the fashionable French court etiquette at the time required a substantial number of enfiladed rooms, in order to satisfy court protocol, and it was impractical to fit these rooms into many older buildings. A shortage of funds curtailed Charles II's attempts to remodel his remaining castles and the redesign of Windsor was the only one to be fully completed in the Restoration years.\nMany castles still retained a defensive role. Castles in England, such as Chepstow and York Castle, were repaired and garrisoned by the king. As military technologies progressed the costs of upgrading older castles could be prohibitive – the estimated £30,000 required for the potential conversion of York in 1682, approximately £4,050,000 in 2009 terms, gives a scale of the potential costs. Castles played a minimal role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, although some fortifications such as Dover Castle were attacked by mobs unhappy with the religious beliefs of their Catholic governors, and the sieges of King John's Castle in Limerick formed part of the endgame to the war in Ireland. In the north of Britain security problems persisted in Scotland. Cromwellian forces had built a number of new modern forts and barracks, but the royal castles of Edinburgh, Dumbarton and Stirling, along with Dunstaffnage, Dunollie and Ruthven Castle, also continued in use as practical fortifications. Tower houses were being built until the 1640s; after the Restoration the fortified tower house fell out of fashion, but the weak state of the Scottish economy was such that while many larger properties were simply abandoned, the more modest castles continued to be used and adapted as houses, rather than rebuilt. In Ireland tower houses and castles remained in use until after the Glorious Revolution, when events led to a dramatic shift in land ownership and a boom in the building of Palladian country houses; in many cases using timbers stripped from the older, abandoned generation of castles and tower houses.\n## 18th century\n### Military and governmental use\nSome castles in Britain and Ireland continued to have modest military utility into the 18th century. Until 1745 a sequence of Jacobite risings threatened the Crown in Scotland, culminating in the rebellion in 1745. Various royal castles were maintained during the period either as part of the English border defences, like Carlisle, or forming part of the internal security measures in Scotland itself, like Stirling Castle. Stirling was able to withstand the Jacobite attack in 1745, although Carlisle was taken; the siege of Blair Castle, at the end of the rebellion in 1746, was the final castle siege to occur in the British Isles. In the aftermath of the conflict Corgaff and many others castles were used as barracks for the forces sent to garrison the Highlands. Some castles, such as Portchester, were used for holding prisoners of war during the Napoleonic Wars at the end of the century and were re-equipped in case of a popular uprising during this revolutionary period. In Ireland Dublin Castle was rebuilt following a fire and reaffirmed as the centre of British administrative and military power.\nMany castles remained in use as county gaols, run by gaolers as effectively private businesses; frequently this involved the gatehouse being maintained as the main prison building, as at Cambridge, Bridgnorth, Lancaster, Newcastle and St Briavels. During the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard conducted his famous survey of prisons and gaols, culminating in his 1777 work The State of the Prisons. This documented the poor quality of these castle facilities; prisoners in Norwich Castle lived in a dungeon, with the floor frequently covered by an inch of water; Oxford was \"close and offensive\"; Worcester was so subject to jail fever that the castle surgeon would not enter the prison; Gloucester was \"wretched in the extreme\". Howard's work caused a shift in public opinion against the use of these older castle facilities as gaols.\n### Social and cultural use\nBy the middle of the century medieval ruined castles had become fashionable once again. They were considered an interesting counterpoint to the now conventional Palladian classical architecture, and a way of giving a degree of medieval allure to their new owners. Historian Oliver Creighton suggests that the ideal image of a castle by the 1750s included \"broken, soft silhouettes and  decayed, rough appearance\". In some cases the countryside surrounding existing castles was remodelled to highlight the ruins, as at Henderskelfe Castle, or at \"Capability\" Brown's reworking of Wardour Castle. Alternatively, ruins might be repaired and reinforced to present a more suitable appearance, as at Harewood Castle. In other cases mottes, such as that at Groby Castle, were reused as the bases for dramatic follies, or alternatively entirely new castle follies could be created; either from scratch or by reusing original stonework, as occurred during the building of Conygar Tower for which various parts of Dunster Castle were cannibalised.\nAt the same time castles were becoming tourist attractions for the first time. By the 1740s Windsor Castle had become an early tourist attraction; wealthier visitors who could afford to pay the castle keeper could enter, see curiosities such as the castle's narwhal horn, and by the 1750s buy the first guidebooks. The first guidebook to Kenilworth Castle followed in 1777 with many later editions following in the coming decades. By the 1780s and 1790s visitors were beginning to progress as far as Chepstow, where an attractive female guide escorted tourists around the ruins as part of the popular Wye Tour. In Scotland Blair Castle became a popular attraction on account of its landscaped gardens, as did Stirling Castle with its romantic connections. Caernarfon in North Wales appealed to many visitors, especially artists. Irish castles proved less popular, partially because contemporary tourists regarded the country as being somewhat backward and the ruins therefore failed to provide the necessary romantic contrast with modern life.\nThe appreciation of castles developed as the century progressed. During the 1770s and 1780s the concept of the picturesque ruin was popularised by the English clergyman William Gilpin. Gilpin published several works on his journeys through Britain, expounding the concept of the \"correctly picturesque\" landscape. Such a landscape, Gilpin argued, usually required a building such as a castle or other ruin to add \"consequence\" to the natural picture. Paintings in this style usually portrayed castles as indistinct, faintly coloured objects in the distance; in writing, the picturesque account eschewed detail in favour of bold first impressions on the sense. The ruins of Goodrich particularly appealed to Gilpin and his followers; Conwy was, however, too well preserved and uninteresting. By contrast the artistic work of antiquarians James Bentham and James Essex at the end of the century, while stopping short of being genuine archaeology, was detailed and precise enough to provide a substantial base of architectural fine detail on medieval castle features and enabled the work of architects such as Wyatt.\n## 19th century\n### Military and governmental use\nThe military utility of the remaining castles in Britain and Ireland continued to diminish. Some castles became regimental depots, including Carlisle Castle and Chester Castle. Carrickfergus Castle was re-equipped with gunports in order to provide coastal defences at the end of the Napoleonic period. Political instability was a major issue during the early 19th century and the popularity of the Chartist movement led to proposals to refortify the Tower of London in the event of civil unrest. In Ireland Dublin Castle played an increasing role in Ireland as Fenian pressures for independence grew during the century.\nThe operation of local prisons in locations such as castles had been criticised, since John Howard's work in the 1770s, and pressure for reform continued to grow in the 1850s and 1860s. Reform of the legislation surrounding bankruptcy and debt in 1869 largely removed the threat of imprisonment for unpaid debts, and in the process eliminated the purpose of the debtor's prisons in castles such as St Briavels. Efforts were made to regularise conditions in local prisons but without much success, and these failures led to prison reform in 1877 which nationalised British prisons, including prisons at castles like York. Compensation was paid to the former owners, although in cases such as York where the facilities were considered so poor as to require complete reconstruction, this payment was denied. In the short term this led to a 39 per cent reduction in the number of prisons in England, including some famous castle prisons such as Norwich; over the coming years, centralisation and changes in prison design led to the closure of most remaining castle prisons.\n### Social and cultural use\nMany castles saw increased visitors by tourists, helped by better transport links and the growth of the railways. The armouries at the Tower of London opened for tourists in 1828 with 40,000 visitors in their first year; by 1858 the numbers had grown to over 100,000 a year. Attractions such as Warwick Castle received 6,000 visitors during 1825 to 1826, many of them travelling from the growing industrial towns in the nearby Midlands, while Victorian tourists recorded being charged six-pence to wander around the ruins of Goodrich Castle. The spread of the railway system across Wales and the Marches strongly influenced the flow of tourists to the region's castles. In Scotland tourist tours became increasingly popular during the 19th century, usually starting at Edinburgh complete with Edinburgh Castle, and then spending up to two weeks further north, taking advantage of the expanding rail and steamer network. Blair Castle remained popular, but additional castles joined the circuit – Cawdor Castle became popular once the railway line reached north to Fort William.\nPurchasing and reading guidebooks became an increasingly important part of visiting castles; by the 1820s visitors could buy an early guidebook at Goodrich outlining the castle's history, the first guidebook to the Tower of London was published in 1841 and Scottish castle guidebooks became well known for providing long historical accounts of their sites, often drawing on the plots of Romantic novels for the details. Indeed, Sir Walter Scott's historical novels Ivanhoe and Kenilworth helped to establish the popular Victorian image of a Gothic medieval castle. Scott's novels set in Scotland also popularised several northern castles, including Tantallon which was featured in Marmion. Histories of Ireland began to stress the role of castles in the rise of Protestantism and \"British values\" in Ireland, although tourism remained limited.\nOne response to this popularity was in commissioning the construction of replica castles. These were particularly popular at beginning of the 19th century, and again later in the Victorian period. Design manuals were published offering details of how to recreate the appearance of an original Gothic castles in a new build, leading to a flurry of work, such as Eastnor in 1815, the fake Norman castle of Penrhyn between 1827 and 1837 and the imitation Edwardian castle of Goodrich Court in 1828. The later Victorians built the Welsh Castell Coch in the 1880s as a fantasy Gothic construction and the last such replica, Castle Drogo, was built as late as 1911.\nAnother response was to improve existing castles, bringing their often chaotic historic features into line with a more integrated architectural aesthetic in a style often termed Gothic Revivalism. There were numerous attempts to restore or rebuild castles so as to produce a consistently Gothic style, informed by genuine medieval details, a movement in which the architect Anthony Salvin was particularly prominent – as illustrated by his reworking of Alnwick and much of Windsor Castle. A similar trend can be seen at Rothesay where William Burges renovated the older castle to produce a more \"authentic\" design, heavily influenced by the work of the French architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. North of the border this resulted in the distinctive style of Scots Baronial Style architecture, which took French and traditional medieval Scottish features and reinvented them in a baroque style. The style also proved popular in Ireland with George Jones' Oliver Castle in the 1850s, for example, forming a good example of the fashion. As with Gothic Revivalism, Scots Baronial architects frequently \"improved\" existing castles: Floors Castle was transformed in 1838 by William Playfair who added grand turrets and cupolas. In a similar way the 16th-century tower house of Lauriston Castle was turned into the Victorian ideal of a \"rambling medieval house\". The style spread south and the famous architect Edward Blore added a Scots Baronial touch to his work at Windsor.\nWith this pace of change concerns had begun to grow by the middle of the century about the threat to medieval buildings in Britain, and in 1877 William Morris established the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. One result of public pressure was the passing of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882, but the provisions of the act focused on unoccupied prehistoric structures and medieval buildings such as castles were exempted from it leaving no legal protection.\n## 20th–21st century\n### 1900–1945\nDuring the first half of the century several castles were maintained, or brought back into military use. During the Irish War of Independence Dublin Castle remained the centre of the British administration, military and intelligence operations in Ireland until the transfer of power and the castle to the Irish Free State in 1922. During the Second World War the Tower of London was used to hold and execute suspected spies, and was used to briefly detain Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler's deputy, in 1941. Edinburgh Castle was used as a prisoner of war facility, while Windsor Castle was stripped of more delicate royal treasures and used to guard the British royal family from the dangers of the Blitz. Some coastal castles were used to support naval operations: Dover Castle's medieval fortifications used as basis for defences across the Dover Strait; Pitreavie Castle in Scotland was used to support the Royal Navy; and Carrickfergus Castle in Ireland was used as a coastal defence base. Some castles, such as Cambridge and Pevensey, were brought into local defence plans in case of a German invasion. A handful of these castles retained a military role after the war; Dover was used as a nuclear war command centre into the 1950s, while Pitreavie was used by NATO until the turn of the 21st century.\nThe strong cultural interest in British castles persisted in the 20th century. In some cases this had destructive consequences as wealthy collectors bought and removed architectural features and other historical artefacts from castles for their own collections, a practice that produced significant official concern. Some of the more significant cases included St Donat's Castle, bought by William Randolph Hearst in 1925 and then decorated with numerous medieval buildings removed from their original sites around Britain, and the case of Hornby, where many parts of the castle were sold off and sent to buyers in the United States. Partially as a result of these events, increasing legal powers were introduced to protect castles – acts of parliament in 1900 and 1910 widened the terms of the earlier legislation on national monuments to allow the inclusion of castles. An act of Parliament in 1913 introduced preservation orders for the first time and these powers were extended in 1931. Similarly, after the end of the Irish Civil War, the new Irish state took early action to extend and strengthen the previous British legislation to protect Irish national monuments.\nAround the beginning of the century there were a number of major restoration projects on British castles. Before the outbreak of the First World War work was undertaken at Chepstow, Bodiam, Caernarfon and Tattershal; after the end of the war various major state funded restoration projects occurred in the 1920s with Pembroke, Caerphilly and Goodrich amongst the largest of these. This work typically centred on cutting back the vegetation encroaching on castle ruins, especially ivy, and removing damaged or unstable stonework; castles such as Beaumaris saw their moats cleaned and reflooded. Some castles such as Eilean Donan in Scotland were substantially rebuilt in the inter-war years. The early UK film industry took an interest in castles as potential sets, starting with Ivanhoe filmed at Chepstow Castle in 1913 and starring US leading actor King Baggot.\n### 1945–21st century\nAfter the Second World War picturesque ruins of castles became unfashionable. The conservation preference was to restore castles so as to produce what Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham have described as a \"meticulously cared for fabric, neat lawns and  highly regulated, visitor-friendly environment\", although the reconstruction or reproduction of the original appearance of castles was discouraged. As a result, the stonework and walls of today's castles, used as tourist attractions, are usually in much better condition than would have been the case in the medieval period. Preserving the broader landscapes of the past also rose in importance, reflected in the decision by the UNESCO World Heritage Site programme to internationally recognise several British castles including Beaumaris, Caernarfon, Conwy, Harlech, Durham and the Tower of London as deserving of special international cultural significance in the 1980s.\nThe single largest group of English castles are now those owned by English Heritage, created out of the former Ministry of Works in 1983. The National Trust increasingly acquired castle properties in England in the 1950s, and is the second largest single owner, followed by the various English local authorities and finally a small number of private owners. Royal castles such as the Tower of London and Windsor are owned by the Occupied Royal Palaces Estate on behalf of the nation. Similar organisations exist in Scotland, where the National Trust for Scotland was established 1931, and in Ireland, where An Taisce was created in 1948 to working alongside the Irish Ministry of Works to maintain castles and other sites. Some new organisations have emerged in recent years to manage castles, such as the Landmark Trust and the Irish Landmark Trust, which have restored a number of castles in Britain and Ireland over the last few decades.\nCastles remain highly popular attractions: in 2018 nearly 2.9 million people visited the Tower of London, 2.1 million visited Edinburgh Castle, 466,000 visited Leeds Castle and 365,000 visited Dover Castle. Ireland, which for many years had not exploited the tourist potential of its castle heritage, began to encourage more tourists in the 1960s and 1970s and Irish castles are now a core part of the Irish tourist industry. British and Irish castles are today also closely linked to the international film industry, with tourist visits to castles now often involving not simply a visit to a historic site, but also a visit to the location of a popular film.\nThe management and handling of Britain's historic castles has at times been contentious. Castles in the late 20th and early 21st century are usually considered part of the heritage industry, in which historic sites and events are commercially presented as visitor attractions. Some academics, such as David Lowenthal, have critiqued the way in which these histories are constantly culturally and socially reconstructed and condemned the \"commercial debasement\" of sites such as the Tower of London. The challenge of how to manage these historic properties has often required very practical decisions. At one end of the spectrum owners and architects have had to deal with the practical challenges of repairing smaller decaying castles used as private houses, such as that at Picton Castle where damp proved a considerable problem. At the other end of the scale the fire at Windsor Castle in 1992 opened up a national debate about how the burnt-out castle wing should be replaced, the degree to which modern designs should be introduced and who should pay the £37 million costs (£50.2 million in 2009 terms). At Kenilworth the speculative and commercial reconstruction of the castle gardens in an Elizabethan style led to a vigorous academic debate over the interpretation of archaeological and historical evidence. Trends in conservation have altered and, in contrast to the prevailing post-war approach to conservation, recent work at castles such as Wigmore, acquired by English Heritage in 1995, has attempted to minimise the degree of intervention to the site.\n## Historiography\nThe earliest histories of British and Irish castles were recorded, albeit in a somewhat fragmented fashion, by John Leland in the 16th century and, by the 19th century, historical analysis of castles had become popular. Victorian historians such as George Clark and John Parker concluded that British castles had been built for the purposes of military defence, but believed that their history was pre-Conquest – concluding that the mottes across the countryside had been built by either the Romans or Celts.\nThe study of castles by historians and archaeologists developed considerably during the 20th century. The early-20th-century historian and archaeologist Ella Armitage published a ground-breaking book in 1912, arguing convincingly that British castles were in fact a Norman introduction, while historian Alexander Thompson also published in the same year, charting the course of the military development of English castles through the Middle Ages. The Victoria County History of England began to document the country's castles on an unprecedented scale, providing an additional resource for historical analysis.\nAfter the Second World War the historical analysis of British castles was dominated by Arnold Taylor, R. Allen Brown and D. J. Cathcart King. These academics made use of a growing amount of archaeological evidence, as the 1940s saw an increasing number of excavations of motte and bailey castles, and the number of castle excavations as a whole went on to double during the 1960s. With an increasing number of castle sites under threat in urban areas, a public scandal in 1972 surrounding the development of the Baynard's Castle site in London contributed to reforms and a re-prioritisation of funding for rescue archaeology. Despite this the number of castle excavations fell between 1974 and 1984, with the archaeological work focusing on conducting excavations on a greater number of small-scale, but fewer large-scale sites. The study of British castles remained primarily focused on analysing their military role, however, drawing on the evolutionary model of improvements suggested by Thompson earlier in the century.\nIn the 1990s a wide-reaching reassessment of the interpretation of British castles took place. A vigorous academic discussion over the history and meanings behind Bodiam Castle began a debate, which concluded that many features of castles previously seen as primarily military in nature were in fact constructed for reasons of status and political power. As historian Robert Liddiard has described it, the older paradigm of \"Norman militarism\" as the driving force behind the formation of Britain's castles was replaced by a model of \"peaceable power\". The next twenty years was characterised by an increasing number of major publications on castle studies, examining the social and political aspects of the fortifications, as well as their role in the historical landscape. Although not unchallenged, this \"revisionist\" perspective remains the dominant theme in the academic literature today."], "selected_questions": ["What role did castles play in Great Britain and Ireland after the Norman invasion of England in 1066?", "How did gunpowder weapons change the role of castles during the 16th century?", "What impact did tourism have on the preservation and restoration of castles in the 19th century?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Castles played important military, economic, and social roles in Great Britain and Ireland after the Norman invasion of England in 1066.

{"name": "Sidon", "documents": ["# Sidon\nSidon (/ˈsaɪdən/ SYE-duhn; Hebrew: צִידוֹן, Ṣīḏōn) known locally as Sayda or Saida (Arabic: صيدا Ṣaydā), is the third-largest city in Lebanon. It is located in the South Governorate, of which it is the capital, on the Mediterranean coast. Tyre to the south and Lebanese capital Beirut to the north are both about 40 kilometres (25 miles) away. Sidon has a population of about 80,000 within city limits, while its metropolitan area has more than a quarter-million inhabitants.\n## Name\nThe Phoenician name Ṣīdūn (𐤑𐤃𐤍, ṢDN) probably meant \"fishery\" or \"fishing town\". It is mentioned in Papyrus Anastasi I as Djedouna. It appears in Biblical Hebrew as Ṣīḏōn (Hebrew: צִידוֹן) and in Syriac as Ṣidon (ܨܝܕܘܢ). This was Hellenised as Sidṓn (Greek: Σιδών), which was Latinised as Sidon. The name appears in Classical Arabic as Ṣaydūn (صَيْدونْ) and in Modern Arabic as Ṣaydā (صيدا).\nAs a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and given the formal name Colonia Aurelia Pia Sidon to honour its imperial sponsor.\nIn the Book of Genesis, Sidon was the first-born son of Canaan, who was a son of Ham, thereby making Sidon a great-grandson of Noah.\nDuring the crusades, Sidon was known in Latin as Sagittus and in French as Saete, Sayette or Sagette.\n## History\nIn the years before Christianity, Sidon had many conquerors: Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, and finally Romans. Herod the Great visited Sidon. Both Jesus and Saint Paul are said to have visited it, too (see Biblical Sidon below). The city was eventually conquered by the Arabs and then by the Ottoman Turks.\n### Prehistory\nSidon has been inhabited since very early in prehistory. The archaeological site of Sidon II shows a lithic assemblage dating to the Acheulean, whilst finds at Sidon III include a Heavy Neolithic assemblage suggested to date just prior to the invention of pottery.\n### Phoenicia in early classical antiquity\nSidon was one of the most important Phoenician cities, and it may have been the oldest. From there and other ports, a great Mediterranean commercial empire was founded. Homer praised the skill of its craftsmen in producing glass, purple dyes, and its women's skill at the art of embroidery. It was also from here that a colonising party went to found the city of Tyre. Tyre also grew into a great city, and in subsequent years there was competition between the two, each claiming to be the metropolis ('Mother City') of Phoenicia.\nGlass manufacturing, Sidon's most important enterprise in the Phoenician era, was conducted on a vast scale, and the production of purple dye was almost as important. The small shell of the Murex trunculus was broken in order to extract the pigment that was so rare it became the mark of royalty.\nIn AD 1855, the sarcophagus of King Eshmun’azar II was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a \"king of the Sidonians,\" probably in the 5th century BC, and that his mother was a priestess of ‘Ashtart, \"the goddess of the Sidonians.\" In this inscription the gods Eshmun and Ba‘al Sidon 'Lord of Sidon' (who may or may not be the same) are mentioned as chief gods of the Sidonians. ‘Ashtart is entitled ‘Ashtart-Shem-Ba‘al, '‘Ashtart the name of the Lord', a title also found in an Ugaritic text.\nNebuchadnezzar II subjugated the city to be part of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. At the end of the Persian era, in 351 BC, Phoenicia was invaded by Artaxerxes III.\n### Persian and Hellenistic periods\nLike other Phoenician city-states, Sidon suffered from a succession of conquerors, first by the Persian Achamenid empire in the 6th century BC, ending with its occupation by Alexander the Great in 333 BC, and the start of the Hellenistic era of Sidon's history. The Persian influence seems to have been profound, as is observed in the change of the architectural style of the city. Under the successors of Alexander, it enjoyed relative autonomy and organised games and competitions in which the greatest athletes of the region participated. In the Hellenistic-period necropolis of Sidon, important finds such as the Alexander Sarcophagus, the Lycian tomb and the Sarcophagus of the Crying Women were discovered, which are now on display at the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul.\n### Roman period\nWhen Sidon fell under Roman domination, it continued to mint its own silver coins. The Romans also built a theater and other major monuments in the city. In the reign of Elagabalus, a Roman colony was established there. During the Byzantine period, when the great earthquake of AD 551 destroyed most of the cities of Phoenice, Beirut's School of Law took refuge in Sidon. The town continued quietly for the next century, until it was conquered by the Arabs in AD 636.\n### Crusader-Ayyubid period\nOn 4 December 1110, Sidon was captured after the siege of Sidon, a decade after the First Crusade, by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem and King Sigurd I of Norway. It then became the center of the Lordship of Sidon, an important vassal-state of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Saladin captured it from the Crusaders in 1187, but German Crusaders restored it to Christian control in the Crusade of 1197. It would remain an important Crusader stronghold until it was finally destroyed by the Ayyubids in 1249. In 1260, it was again destroyed by the Mongols led by Kitbuqa. The remains of the original walls are still visible.\n### Ottoman period\nAfter Sidon came under Ottoman Turkish rule in the early 16th century, it became the capital of the Sidon Eyalet (province) and regained a great deal of its earlier commercial importance. Starting in the 18th century the city was dominated by the Hammud family of notables, who monopolized the production and exporting of cotton in the region and built numerous palaces and public works in the city. The Hammuds also served as government customs agents and tax collectors for various Ottoman religious foundations.\nDuring the Egyptian–Ottoman War, Sidon – like much of Ottoman Syria – was occupied by the forces of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. His ambitions were opposed by the British Empire, which backed the Ottomans. The British Admiral Charles Napier, commanding a mixed squadron of British, Turkish and Austrian ships, bombarded Sidon on 26 September 1840, and landed with the storming column. Sidon capitulated in two days, and the British went on to Acre. This action was recalled in two Royal Navy vessels being named HMS Sidon.\nFrom 1887 the Royal necropolis of Sido was extensively excavated by the Ottomans, and its treasured trasferred to Istanbul (like the Alexander sarcophagus).\n### After World War I\nAfter World War I it became part of the French Mandate of Lebanon. During World War II the city, together with the rest of Lebanon, was captured by British forces fighting against the Vichy French, and following the war it became a major city of independent Lebanon.\nFollowing the Palestinian exodus in 1948, a considerable number of Palestinian refugees arrived in Sidon, as in other Lebanese cities, and were settled at the large refugee camps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh. At first these consisted of enormous rows of tents, but gradually houses were constructed. The refugee camps constituted de facto neighborhoods of Sidon, but had a separate legal and political status which made them into a kind of enclaves. At the same time, the remaining Jews of the city fled, and the Jewish cemetery fell into disrepair, threatened by coastal erosion.\nOn Easter Sunday, 19 April 1981, at least sixteen people were killed in Sidon after the (South Lebanon Army) SLA’s long-range artillery indiscriminately shelled the city centre. It was reported that it was in response to a request from Bashir Gemayel in connection with ongoing Syrian attacks on Phalangist positions around Zahle. Israel denied involvement.\nAfter the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon Sidon was occupied by the Israeli army for almost two and a half years.\nOn 18 August 1997, following a roadside bomb near Jezzine which killed of two teenage members of a SLA leader’s family, SLA artillery shelled Sidon killing seven civilians and wounding thirty-five. Hizbollah responded the following day by firing 60–80 rockets into the security zone and northern Israel. According to UNIFIL observers the missiles appeared to be targeted at uninhabited areas. The attack on Sidon is credited with leading to a truce between Hizbollah and Amal and increased cooperation between the two groups and the Lebanese Army. This was evident in the Ansariya ambush the following month.\nSidon was a small fishing town of 10,000 inhabitants in 1900, but studies in 2000 showed a population of 65,000 in the city, and around 200,000 in the metropolitan area. The little level land around the city is used for cultivation of some wheat, vegetables, and fruits, especially citrus and bananas. The fishing in the city remains active with a newly opened fishery that sells fresh fish by bidding every morning. The ancient basin was transformed into a fishing port, while a small quay was constructed to receive small commercial vessels. (Refer to the \"Old City\" and the \"Architecture and landscape\" sections below.)\nSaida Municipal Stadium was inaugurated in 2000 for the Asian Football Confederation's Cup 2000.\n## Politics\nThis sectarian and demographic division rose to the surface during the Lebanese Civil War, when armed clashes erupted between Sunni Muslims and Christians. The clashes ended with the surrender of the Christian front, and the Christians were forced to move to east Beirut. After the war ended in 1990, the Christians have gradually returned to their hometowns and in the year 2000 many fled to Israel.\nThe local politics of Sidon in the 20th century was mainly dominated up till the 1980s by allegiances around two main families, the El-Bizri and Saad. The El-Bizri politicians were known for their business connections, close ties with eminent Lebanese and Levantine leaders, and their bent on serving the Lebanese state as government ministers, officials and mayors. The Saad politicians tended to be populist and became engaged in violent protests in the 1940s, 1950s and then during the Lebanese civil war as Nasserites (populist followers of Nasser in Lebanon).\nThe local political conflict between these two families was always resolved through amicable means and ties of kinship. Their hold over the political aspects of the city was similar to that of Mediterranean families in Sicily or to being also influenced by the ties of Arab families, clans, and tribes in traditionalist forms. The most notable figures of the El-Bizri family in the first half of the 20th century were: Ahmad El-Bizri (born 1899), Salah El-Bizri, Eizeddine El-Bizri (commonly known as Eizzo) and Anwar El-Bizri (born 1910). These four brothers were businessmen and politicians who dominated the political life of the city up till the late 1940s, using traditional inherited forms of governance since Ottoman times. With intelligence and strength they maintained their power for over 50 years. It is from their ranks that Maarouf Saad started his public life, and their close cousins, Nazih El-Bizri, Amin El-Bizri, and Fouad El-Bizri became the next generation of politicians and statesmen in Lebanon; holding positions as ministers and members of parliament.\nThe El-Bizri and the Saad political practices were bent on social justice and on local service in public affairs. The El-Bizri were since the Ottoman rule bent on serving the state, and this continued with their loyalty and support to the successive governments of Lebanon since the times of independence. They also helped eminent politicians and statesmen from Sidonian descent such as the Prime Ministers Riad Solh, Takieddine el-Solh and Rashid Solh, they also gave their support to former Prime Minister Saeb Salam, father of Tamam Salam, Prime Minister 2014–2016. The presence of the El-Bizris was at times intimidating on the local scene, but they were also known for their goodwill and dignified public service.\nThe Saad family developed their links with Nasserism in the 1950s and engaged in the uprising and armed protest of 1958 against the government of the Lebanese President Chamoun. They also became involved in the civil war as part of the left wing politics of the Lebanon (Al-Haraka al-Wataniyya) with PLO connections, and they actively contributed to resisting the Israeli occupation after 1982. The Saads remained populist in their politics and focused on the grassroots, while the El-Bizri were generally appealing to the middle and upper classes. In the middle 1980s, the Hariri family started to rise to prominence and it became the most influential in Sidon in political and financial terms, even though the presence of the Saad and the El-Bizri in local politics remained significant at the level of visibility and activism.\nThe politics of Sidon is similar to that of the traditional old cities of the Levant in the sense of being family-based. In broad terms one could say that the El-Bizri family had an influence since Ottoman times, and most significantly during the entirety of the 20th century. It was local in impact at first, but then the members of this family became influential within the Lebanese state and institutions, and they supported the Solh family that had successive Prime Ministers and that moved its power base from Sidon to Beirut. The Saad family developed its original politics from within the sphere of influence of the El-Bizri family and then became a power to reckon with on its own after 1948, and most powerfully in 1958, then in the civil war and up till today.\nMaarouf Saad, the leader of his family, and a local influential politician, was assassinated at the eve of the Lebanese civil war in 1975. The Saads retained their populism and grassroots appeal, and attracted a core of loyal adherents since the middle of the 20th century. While the El-Bizri were Levantine in their Arabism (namely focused mainly on Bilad al-Shaam in regional politics), and the Solh being also similar to them in this, the Saad were leaning more towards a broader pan-Arabism (Nasserite, Libyan, and then Syrian). As for the Hariri family, they are regionally focused on Saudi orientations in politics. The Hariri family started to rise to political and economic prominence in the 1980s and became perhaps the most influential family in Lebanon by the middle 1990s. It is now one of the most organised in political terms and it follows modern forms of political practice through a large party (Future Movement) that cuts across various economic classes but that is usually seen as a Sunni political movement with regional weight due to its close ties with Saudi Arabia.\n## Impact on Sidon of regional underdevelopment\nAccording to a recent United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report \"data also point to an increase in urban poverty especially in Lebanon's largest cities suburbs such as Beirut, Tripoli and Saida, as illustrated by poverty-driven symptoms (child labour, over-crowding and deteriorated environment conditions).\"\nIn another UNDP report, the author discusses the development predominance of Beirut over the rest of the regions of Lebanon (North, South and Beqaa) is a well-known imbalance that can be dated to the early 19th century. With the expansion of Beirut in the 1870s, urban growth in the future capital outpaced Tripoli and Saida. Transportation routes, missionary schools, universities and hospitals as well as the Beirut port development and the commerce of silk participated to the fortification of Beirut as a major trade center for Mediterranean exchange (ARNAUD 1993; LABAKI 1999: 23). However, the establishment of Great Lebanon in 1920, under the French mandate, added the poorer areas of the North (Akkar), Beqaa (Baalbak-Hermel) and the South (Jabal Aamel) to the relatively affluent cities of Mount Lebanon. This addition made of Lebanon a country composed of unequally developed regions. This legacy remains a heavy load to bear socially, culturally, economically and politically. Even though the public policies elaborated by the young Lebanese State were attempting to have regional perspectives, the early urban planning schemes reveal a development approach exclusively axed on Beirut and its suburbs.\nThe post war development policy of the State, promoted by Hariri government (1992–1998), was centered around balanced development and is widely inspired by the 1943 Pact and the 1989 Taef agreement (LABAKI1993: 104). However the application of this policy aims mainly at the rehabilitation and construction of roads and infrastructures (electricity, telephone, sewage). Another of its components is the rehabilitation of government buildings (airport, port, schools, universities and hospitals). Transportation projects (mainly concentrated on the coastal line) constitute 25% of the budget of 10-year economic plan developed by the CDR (BAALBAKI 1994: 90). However, all these projects are predominantly concentrated around Beirut, ignoring the regions.\n### The Former Makab (waste dump) and the Treatment Plant\nNear the southern entrance to the city used to be a 'rubbish mountain' called at the time by the locals the Makab; namely, a 600,000 cubic metre heap that reached the height of a four-story building. It was originally created to dispose of the remains of buildings destroyed in Israeli air strikes during the 1982 invasion, but it then became the main dump for the city. Growing out of the sea, it became an environmental hazard, with medical waste and plastic bags polluting nearby fishing grounds.\nSidon politicians, including the Hariri family, failed for decades to resolve the Makab crisis—which has endangered residents health (especially during episodic burning). In 2004, Engineer Hamzi Moghrabi, a Sidon native, conceived the idea to establish a treatment plant for the city's decades-old chronic waste problem. He established the privately funded IBC Enviro and the treatment plant became operational in 2013.\nThe Ministry of Environment came up with a $50,000+ plan to clean the whole area and transform the dump into a green space, along with other heaps in the country. Qamla beach in Sidon, a coast in close proximity to the Sea Castle, witnessed a large municipal cleanup in May 2011, as it was an easy target of rubbish being washed up by the Makab. These plans aim to revive the former glory of the city's coasts and attract tourists who avoided swimming in Sidon's sea before. The project of cleaning the region where the waste dump has already started, and currently a waves-barrier is being built, and the vast bulk of the waste dump being cleared.\n## Local government\nThe city of Sidon is administrated by the Municipality of Sidon. The municipality is constituted of a council of 21 members including the City Mayor and his Deputy. It has administrative and financial independence but remains under the control and supervision of the central government, specifically the Ministry of Interior. The municipality's jurisdiction is limited to a region of 786 hectares in area and 5 meters in elevation, while each of the city's suburbs is administrated by its own independent municipal council. Sidon is the center of the Governorate of South Lebanon, and hosts the seat of the Governor of Southern Lebanon. The city is also the center of the Sidon District and the Union of Sidon and Zahrani Municipalities (founded in 1978 and contains 15 municipalities). Sidon hosts the southern regional headquarters of a series of governmental facilities like the Central Bank of Lebanon, Électricité du Liban, Central Telecommunications Station and others. It is also the home of the Justice Palace of South Lebanon in its new headquarters on East Boulevard (the old headquarters were an old Ottoman Saray that is currently occupied by the LSF and is planned to be transformed into a cultural center by the municipality).\nIn the 2000 and 2005 parliamentary elections, the Sidon District along with the Tyre and Bint Jbeil districts formed the first electoral district of South Lebanon. However, in the 2009 elections – and due to the reactivation of the 1960 electoral law – the city of Sidon was separated from its district to form a separate electoral district.\n## Demographics\nThe overwhelming majority of Sidon's population belong to the Sunni sect of Islam, with few Shiites and Christians. Sidon is the seat of the Greek Melkite Catholic Archbishop of Sidon and Deir el Qamar, and has housed a significant Catholic population throughout its history. Sidon also hosts the seat of the Shiite Ayatollah of South Lebanon.\nIn the 1930s, when Lebanon was still under the French mandate, Sidon had the largest Jewish population in Lebanon, estimated at 3,588, compared to 3,060 in Beirut.\n## Main sights\nSidon Sea Castle, a fortress built by the Crusaders in the early 13th century. It is located near the Port of Sidon. Sidon Soap Museum. It traces the history of the soap making in the region and its different manufacturing steps. Khan al-Franj (\"Caravanserai of the French\"), a complex built in the 16th century, though erroneously credited to Emir Fakhreddine in the 17th century. It gained its name for accommodating French merchants and goods in order to develop trade with Europe. This is a typical khan with a large rectangular courtyard and a central fountain surrounded by covered galleries. Debbane Palace, a historical residence built in 1721, an example of Arab-Ottoman architecture. It is currently in the process of being transformed into the History Museum of Sidon. This villa was earlier occupied by the Hammoud family in the 18th century and also by members of the famous Ottoman aristocrats of the Abaza clan in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The vaults at the ground level being originally stables for the villa residents and then turned into shops as part of the old souks, and known until recent time by association to the Abazas. The Castle of St. Louis (Qalaat Al Muizz). It was built by the Crusaders in the 13th century on top of the remains of a fortress built by the Fatimid caliph Al Muizz. It is located to the south of the Old Souks near Murex Hill. Eshmun Temple, dedicated to the Phoenician God of healing. Built in the 7th century BC, it is located in the north of Sidon near the Awali river. The British War Cemetery in Sidon. Opened in 1943 by units of His Majesty's (King George VI) British Forces occupying the Lebanon after the 1941 campaign against the Vichy French troops. It was originally used for the burial of men who died while serving with the occupation force, but subsequently the graves of a number of the casualties of the 1941 campaign were moved into the cemetery from other burial grounds or from isolated positions in the vicinity. The cemetery now contains 176 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War and nine war graves of other nationalities. It was designed by G. Vey. It is perhaps that only garden in modern Sidon that is elegantly kept and cared for. It is not a public garden but can be visited when the wardens have its gateways opened Khan Sacy in Sidon: Khan Sacy has undergone a series of modifications and tells part of the city's past. In its heart, it hides a much older story. It is composed of rooms of a majestic height with three water wells, three hammams and an oven.\n## Education\nSidon is home to numerous educational facilities ranging from public elementary schools to private universities. According to a 2006 study, the city is home to 29 schools that serve a total of 18,731 students: 37% are in public schools, 63% are in private schools. Sidon also contains 10 universities, 5 of which are private universities.\n## Archaeology\nThe following archaeological sites in the area indicate settlements from the earliest prehistorical times.\nSidon I is an archaeological site located to the east of the city, south of the road to Jezzine. An assemblage of flint tools was found by P. E. Gigues suggested to date between 3800 and 3200 BC. The collection included narrow axes or chisels that were polished on one side and flaked on the other, similar to ones found at Ain Cheikh, Nahr Zahrani and Gelal en Namous. The collection appears to have gone missing from the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut.\nSidon II is said to be \"near the church\" at approximately fifty meters above sea level. P. E. Gigues suggested that the industry found on the surface of this site dated to the Acheulean.\nSidon III was found by E. Passemard in the 1920s, who made a collection of material that is now in the National Museum of Beirut marked \"Camp de l'Aviation\". It includes large flint and chert bifacials that may be of Heavy Neolithic origin.\nSidon IV is the tell mound of ancient Sidon with Early Bronze Age (c. 3200 BC) deposits, now located underneath the ruined Saint Louis Castle and what are also thought to be the ruins of a Roman theater.\n### Bronze Age Sidon\nIn the area of this ruined Crusader castle, recent excavations uncovered a late Early Bronze Age I (EB I) settlement on bedrock. Here, an uninterrupted sequence from EB I to EB III was found. A modest third-millennium BC settlement consisting of domestic installations and tombs was also uncovered. Yet the following history of Sidon was not clarified. Very little has been known about the location, extent, and significance of Middle Bronze Age (MBA) Sidon until recently.\nSince the early 21st century, Tell el-Burak excavations have helped significantly in this area, because it was an active settlement during MBA, and quite well preserved. Tell el-Burak is located along the coast 9 km south from Sidon. Previously, there was a big gap in the history of this whole coastal area from the end of the Early Bronze Age until the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, when Sidon is first mentioned in the historical texts.\nArchaeologists determined that Sidon was clearly the big power centre during MBA, controlling significant territory. So there appears to have been the \"Kingdom of Sidon\" that controlled el-Burak, and many other surrounding areas.\n### Excavation history\nThe area around Sidon contains a number of important necropoli (below in order of age, and noting their principal excavators):\nDakerman (Roger Saidah, 1968–1969) Tambourit (Saidah, 1977) Magharet Abloun (Aimé Péretié, 1855; Ernest Renan, 1864; Georges Contenau, 1920) Ayaa (William King Eddy, 1887; Osman Hamdi Bey, 1892; Contenau, 1920) Ain al-Hilweh (Charles Cutler Torrey, 1919–1920) El-Merah (Contenau, 1920) Qrayé (Contenau, 1920) Almoun, (Conenau, 1924) El-Harah (Theodore Makridi, 1904; Contenau, 1924) Magharet Abloun, Greco-Roman part (Renan, 1864; Contenau, 1914–1924) Helalié/Baramié/Mar Elias (William John Bankes, 1816; Renan 1864; Contenau, 1914; M. Meurdrac & L. Albanèse, 1938–1939)\nIn indication of the high-profile of the old city of Sidon in archaeological expeditions, and mainly in the 19th century, in October 1860 the famous French scholar Ernest Renan was entrusted with an archaeological mission to Lebanon, which included the search for the antique parts of Sidon. The Phoenician inscriptions that he discovered, and his field data, were eventually published in his notebook the: Mission de Phénicie (1864–1874; Phoenician Expedition).\nThe St. Louis land-castle grounds were excavated in 1914–1920 by a French team. Then eastwards a new site was also excavated by another generation of French expeditions in the 1960s. This same site received renewed attention in 1998 when the Directorate General of Antiquities in Lebanon authorized the British Museum to begin excavations on this area of land that was specifically demarcated for archaeological research. This has resulted in published papers, with a special focus on studying ceramics.\nThe archaeological fieldwork was not fully undertaken since the independence of the Lebanon. The main finds are displayed in the National Museum in Beirut. The fieldwork was also interrupted during the long civil war period, and it is now resumed but at a timid and slow scale, and not involving major international expeditions or expertise. Perhaps this is also indicative of the general lack in cultural interests among the authorities of this city, and almost of the non-existence of notable intellectual activities in its modern life. There are signs that the locals are beginning to recognize the value of the medieval quarters, but this remains linked to minor individual initiatives and not a coordinated collective effort to rehabilitate it like it has been the case with Byblos, even though the old district of Sidon contains a great wealth in old and ancient architecture.\n## Biblical Sidon\n### Hebrew Bible/Old Testament\nThe Hebrew Bible describes Sidon (צִידוֹן‎) in several passages:\nIt received its name from the \"first-born\" of Canaan, the grandson of Noah (Genesis 10:15, 19). The Tribe of Zebulun has a frontier on Sidon (Genesis 49:13) It was the first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Canaan, and from its extensive commercial relations became a \"great\" city (Joshua 11:8, 19:28). It was the mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued (Judges 1:31). The Sidonians long oppressed Israel (Judges 10:12). From the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its \"virgin daughter\" (Isaiah 23:12), rose to its place of pre-eminence. Solomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Sidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the land of Israel (1 Kings 11:1, 33). Jezebel was a Sidonian princess (1 Kings 16:31). It was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce (1 Kings 5:6; 1 Chronicles 22:4; Ezekiel 27:8). It is frequently referred to by the prophets (Isaiah 23:2, 4, 12; Jeremiah 25:22, 27:3, 47:4; Ezekiel 27:8, 28:21, 22, 32:30; Joel 3:4). Elijah sojourned in Sidon, performing miracles (1 Kings 17:9–24; see also in the New Testament, Luke 4:26).\n### New Testament\nJesus visited the region or \"coasts\" (King James Version) of Tyre and Sidon (Matthew 15:21; Mark 7:24) and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching (Mark 3:8; Luke 6:17), leading to the stark contrast in Matthew 11:21–23 to Korazin and Bethsaida. See the exorcism of the Syrophoenician woman's daughter, which takes place on the coast, in the region of Sidon and Tyre. From Sidon, at which his ship put in after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for Rome (Acts 27:3, 4).\nThen he returned from the region of Tyre, and went by way of Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis (Mark 7:31)\n## Sanchuniathon\nThe account ascribed to the Phoenician historian Sanchuniathon makes Sidon a daughter of Pontus, son of Nereus. She is said there to have first invented musical song from the sweetness of her voice.\n## Gallery\nPort of Sidon, 19th century The castle and the harbour of Saida, the ancient Sidon Sidon Castle Sidon, Sarcophagus relief of a boat Sidon coast Sidon College site Sidon Stadium Sidon, Lebanon, Panorama Mosque, Sidon Saida Souks صيدا - صورة جوية قديمة Mosque Sidon, vue meridionale Sidon District Map\n## International relations\n### Twin towns and sister cities\nSidon is twinned with:\nConstanța, Romania Sofia, Bulgaria Sochi, Russia\n## Notable people\n### In antiquity and the pre-modern era\nChronological list.\nEumaeus, character from Greek mythology.

{"name": "Electorate of Saxony", "documents": ["# Electorate of Saxony\nThe Electorate of Saxony, also known as Electoral Saxony (German: Kurfürstentum Sachsen or Kursachsen), was a territory of the Holy Roman Empire from 1356–1806. It was centered around the cities of Dresden, Leipzig and Chemnitz.\nIn the Golden Bull of 1356, Emperor Charles IV designated the Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg an electorate, a territory whose ruler was one of the prince-electors who chose the Holy Roman emperor. After the extinction of the male Saxe-Wittenberg line of the House of Ascania in 1422, the duchy and the electorate passed to the House of Wettin. The electoral privilege was tied only to the Electoral Circle, specifically the territory of the former Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg.\nIn the 1485 Treaty of Leipzig, the Wettin noble house was divided between the sons of Elector Frederick II into the Ernestine and Albertine lines, with the electoral district going to the Ernestines. In 1547, when the Ernestine elector John Frederick I was defeated in the Schmalkaldic War, the electoral district and electorship passed to the Albertine line. They remained electors until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, after which they gained the Saxon kingship through an alliance with Napoleon. The Electorate of Saxony then became the Kingdom of Saxony.\nThe Electorate of Saxony had a diversified economy and a high level of prosperity, although it suffered major setbacks during and following both the Thirty Years' War of 1618–1648 and the Seven Years' War of 1756–1763. Its middle-class structures were restricted in their development by the nobility and the administration and tended to lag behind contemporary western nations such as the Dutch Republic. Important humanistic and educational impulses came from Saxony through the Reformation that started in the Electorate in the early 1500s. Especially in the 18th century, Saxon culture and arts flourished.\nFor about 200 years until the end of the 17th century, the Electorate was the second most important territory in the Holy Roman Empire and a key protector of its Protestant principalities. At the time of its greatest extent in 1807 (one year after it was elevated to the status of a kingdom), Saxony had reached a size of 34,994 square kilometers (about 13,500 square miles) and had a population of 2,010,000.\n## Establishment of the Electorate\n### Background\nFrom the end of the 12th to the middle of the 13th century, a narrow circle of imperial electors emerged that succeeded in excluding others from their number. The electoral college consisted initially of two ecclesiastical and two secular princes, one of whom was the duke of Saxony. The circle was extended in the 13th century to seven: the archbishops of Mainz, Trier and Cologne plus the count palatine of the Rhine, the margrave of Brandenburg, the king of Bohemia and the duke of Saxony. Tying electoral rights to individual territories took place in the early 13th century and solidified from then on. In the case of the Electorate of Saxony, the specific territory tied to was the Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg.\nThe Old Saxony of the early Middle Ages corresponded roughly to the present German state of Lower Saxony. In 1180 Emperor Frederick Barbarossa of the rival Hohenstaufen dynasty deprived the Saxon duke Henry the Lion of his power, and his duchy was divided, with the western part placed under the Archbishop of Cologne as the Duchy of Westphalia, while the eastern part, which continued to bear the name Saxony, was enfeoffed to the House of Ascania. Bernhard III became the first Saxon duke. He did not succeed in establishing territorial rule over the full area of the old Duchy of Saxony that had been awarded to him, with the result that the new Ascanian Duchy of Saxony was formed only by his title and the imperial fiefs of Lauenburg and Wittenberg.\nBernhard was succeeded by Albert I (r. 1212–1260). After his death in 1260, his sons John I and Albert II (r. 1260–1298) divided his land into the Duchies of Saxe-Wittenberg and Saxe-Lauenburg. Initially the brothers ruled together, but after Albert became burgrave of Magdeburg in 1269, a final division of the duchies under the two rulers became final and was formalized in 1296. Saxe-Wittenberg succeeded in claiming the electoral dignity permanently and for itself alone.\n### Saxe-Wittenberg becomes Electoral Saxony\nThe Wittenberg Ascanians Albert I, Albert II and Rudolf I (r. 1298–1356) ruled as dukes of Saxony for almost 150 years. They secured the continuity of the dynasty with their sons and asserted themselves as heirs to the Saxon electoral privilege. The electors were mainly concerned with external conflicts with other territorial rulers and pushed forward the territorial development of the still sparsely populated area. In 1290 the duchy was extended to include the Burgraviate of Magdeburg and the Countship of Brehna.\nThe electoral privilege was not institutionally regulated until 1356 and the Golden Bull, the fundamental law of the Empire settling the method of electing the German king by seven prince-electors. Through it Emperor Charles IV permanently granted the electoral privilege to Rudolf I as Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg and decreed the indivisibility of the territory. The dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg rose to a place among the highest-ranking princes of the Empire. In addition to being one of the seven German electorates, Saxe-Wittenberg had possession of the office of arch-marshal of the Holy Roman Empire.\nIn terms of size, Saxe-Wittenberg remained a rather insignificant territory in the Empire with an area of only about 4,500 to 5,000 square kilometers. There were no large urban centers, but the duchy's strategic location along the middle of the Elbe River gave the area promise.\n### Re-Enfeoffment of the Electorate\nIn November 1422 Albert III (r. 1419–1422), Elector and Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg, died without descendants who were entitled to inherit. The German king, on the basis of the provisions of the Golden Bull, confiscated the duchy as a vacant imperial fiefdom. Both the Lauenburg Ascanians under Duke Erich V and the Meissen Wettins in the person of Frederick I (r. 1423–1428) laid claim to Saxe-Wittenberg and the associated electoral privilege.\nFrederick I's claim was based on his support of the Catholic forces in the religious Hussite Wars of 1419–1434. In 1423 Sigismund, King of Germany and Bohemia, awarded the political inheritance of Albert III as an imperial fiefdom to the Wettin margraves of Meissen and granted them the Electorate of Saxony along with its electoral privilege. The Margravate of Meissen was absorbed into the Electorate of Saxony, and Saxe-Wittenberg was incorporated into the Wettin dominion as an electoral district. It was able to maintain a quasi-dominant position in the Wettin state until 1548.\nThe Wettins, who had been margraves of the March of Lusatia since 1089 and of Meissen since 1125, gained a strategically important area to the north of their territories with Saxe-Wittenberg. It gave them a transportation connection to important northern German cities such as Magdeburg and a stronger integration into the middle Elbe country which was densely populated and important economically. Access to the Elbe made it possible for them to participate in trade with the Hanseatic League, which included several cities along the river. The former colonized land between the Saale and Elbe was connected to the long-settled land in the west through its political upgrade, which occurred at almost the same time that the Hohenzollerns were granted the Electorate of Brandenburg. The Wettins rose to become the leading power in central Germany. Politically, they proved to be committed administrators of the Empire and built up a compact territory, especially through purchases in the 15th century. From the area around Wittenberg the name \"Saxony\" gradually spread to encompass all the Wettin territories on the upper Elbe.\n## Beginning of Wettin rule\n### Formation of the territorial complex in the late Middle Ages\nSince the ruler's place of residence and his visibility to the people gained in importance in the early phase of the Renaissance, the Wettins created a new seat in the Dresden valley of the Elbe towards the end of the 15th century. Dresden became the permanent residence of the elector, his councilors and administrative officials.\nThe elector's increased expenses for equipping and maintaining an army and for his own court could no longer be met as before. The solution was to levy new types of taxes, which required the consent of the estates of the realm. The meeting of the estates that Elector Frederick II (r. 1428–1464) organized in 1438 is considered to be the first state parliament (Landtag) in Saxony. The estates were given the right to meet without being summoned by the ruler when there were reforms in taxation. As a result, state parliaments were held more and more frequently, and the Wettin \"state of the estates\" (Ständestaat) that lasted until the 19th century was formed.\nAs was common in other German houses, the Wettins regularly divided their possessions among sons and brothers, which often led to intra-family tensions. After the death in 1440 of Frederick IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, the Landgraviate of Thuringia reverted to the Electorate. Disagreements between the landgrave's nephews Elector Frederick II and William III led to the Division of Altenburg of 1445, in which William III received the Thuringian and Franconian parts and Frederick the eastern part of the Electorate.\nDisputes over the division led to the Saxon Fratricidal War. After five years of fighting, the situation remained unchanged, although large areas of the country had been devastated. The war was ended with the Peace of Pforta on 27 January 1451. The treaty confirmed the Altenburg partition, temporarily dividing the Wettin domain into an eastern and a western part. The western part of Saxony, which had been ruled by a collateral line of the Wettins since 1382, reverted to the main Wettin line after the death in 1482 of its last representative, Duke William III of Saxony. The unity of the country was then restored.\nOf great importance for the development of the country was the agreement reached in 1459 between Elector Frederick II and George of Poděbrady, King of Bohemia, in the Treaty of Eger. It brought about a hereditary settlement and a clear demarcation of the borders between the Kingdom of Bohemia and Saxony.\n### Joint rule of Ernest and Albert\nWhen Elector Frederick II died in Leipzig on 7 September 1464, his eldest son Ernest (r. 1464–1486) succeeded him at the age of 23. It marked the beginning of an almost twenty-year period of joint rule with his brother Duke Albert. Initially the two ruled in harmony, favored by the onset of a long economic upswing and increasing urban development. Agreement on political actions and decisions was ensured by a joint court in Dresden Castle. Together the brothers had the Albrechtsburg Castle built in Meissen on the French model. In their policy, they pursued additional accommodation with Bohemia and provided active military assistance to the Empire against the Ottoman Empire and in the War of the Burgundian Succession.\nThe period of the joint reign of Ernest and Albert saw extensive silver discoveries in the Ore Mountains that stimulated a sustained economic boom. The mining dividends enabled the Saxon princes to pursue a broad domestic and foreign policy agenda. They purchased lands within the Wettin dominion and expanded their territory to the north and east.\nLeipzig became an important economic center of the Holy Roman Empire after the emperor granted it the right to hold fairs three times a year. At the imperial fairs the electors were able to convert their silver into cash, and with their filled coffers they started an active building program. Due to Leipzig's newly granted market and staple rights, traffic increased on the major trade routes that met in the city, and Leipzig became an important trading center for the whole of Europe. The customs revenues along the route in turn benefited the electoral treasury. In 1480 the printer Konrad Kachelofen from Nuremberg settled in Leipzig and with his letterpress began the Leipzig tradition of book printing.\nIn 1483 Elector Ernest and Duke Albert established the Leipzig High Court. It was staffed by nobles and burghers and was the first independent public authority in Electoral Saxony that was detached from the prince and court. An effective local and central administration secured the rule of the electors. Internal order was restored after the unrest and insecurity that robber barons had caused in Germany. Blood feuds were eliminated, the roads were secured from robbery, and an efficient legal system was established. Saxony became culturally, economically, and governmentally advanced compared to the other German states of the time.\nAfter the western part of Saxony reverted to the main Wettin line following the death Duke William III in 1482, Saxony became the second power in the Holy Roman Empire next to the Habsburg domains. The family network of the Wettins expanded to include members who were ecclesiastical dignitaries in Magdeburg, Halberstadt and Mainz, with additional claims to duchies on the lower Rhine.\n### Renewed division\nTensions that had their origins in family relations increased between the two brothers Ernest and Albert and culminated in the Partition of Leipzig of 11 November 1485. It was not originally intended to be permanent, but in the end it significantly weakened the powerful position of the Electorate of Saxony in the Holy Roman Empire and led to open confrontation.\nErnest had his main focus in the north with his residence at Torgau and held the prestigious electoral district in the north. His territory consisted of 14 exclaves in addition to the main complex. The Ernestines retained the title of elector, which could be transferred to all male members of the family. Albert resided in Dresden as Duke of Saxony and was dominant in the east. He had the strategically better territory because it consisted of only two main areas and four exclaves. The two largest Saxon cities, Leipzig and Dresden, were located in his dominions.\n## The Reformation\nWhen Martin Luther posted his 95 theses in Wittenberg in 1517, the electoral district and Ernestine possessions of Saxony became the focus of European attention since it was there that the first phase of the Protestant Reformation was anchored. Elector Frederick the Wise (r. 1486–1525) protected Luther, most notably when he sheltered him at the Wartburg Castle for ten months in 1521/22 after Luther had refused to recant at the Diet of Worms, but the Albertine duke George the Bearded fought against his ideas and rejected open action against the emperor. It was only after George's death that the Reformation was introduced in the Albertine part of the country. For their part, the Ernestines became involved in the Reformation throughout the Empire, forming with the Schmalkaldic League of Lutheran princes a counterweight to the imperial Catholic side and openly calling for it to be challenged. The religious differences led to the Schmalkaldic War of 1546/47, which was won by the Catholics.\nThe events of the Peasants' War of 1525 touched Saxon territories only marginally in the Vogtland and the Ore Mountains. The pressure on the peasantry was less in Saxony than in the southwestern areas of the Empire because of Saxony's strong sovereign position and administration which imposed barriers to arbitrary actions by the estate-owning nobility.\n### Rise of the Albertines as the Protestant protecting power in the Empire\nIn the Battle of Mühlberg in the Schmalkaldic War, the Albertine duke Maurice of Saxony, an ally of Emperor Charles V, defeated the Ernestine elector John Frederick I (r. 1532–1547). In the Capitulation of Wittenberg, Maurice (r. 1547–1543) was enfeoffed with the electoral privilege in 1547 and with the Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg in 1548, but contrary to the emperor's promises, he did not receive all of the Ernestine territories.\nThe Ernestine line lost half of its possessions and retained only Weimar, Jena, Saalfeld, Weida, Gotha, Eisenach and Coburg. The fragmentation of the Ernestine possessions into numerous small states began in 1572. Two main Ernestine lines emerged in 1640, the House of Saxe-Weimar and the House of Saxe-Gotha. While the former had only a few collateral lines which were eventually united to form Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the House of Saxe-Gotha counted a great many collateral lines, most of which ruled over their own lands.\nIt was the Albertine territories that for the most part made up what is now Saxony. Once again it became the second most important German state in the Holy Roman Empire after the Habsburg states, with the ability to play a decisive role in imperial politics. The state along the middle course of the Elbe that Electoral Saxony formed was not, however, fully connected geographically. Elector Maurice and his successor, his brother Augustus (r. 1553–1586), worked to fill in the gaps. On 13 July 1547 the estates of the realm from the old and new territories were convened in Leipzig for two weeks as state parliament.\nElector Maurice succeeded in clearing the way for the recognition of the new faith in the Empire. Under his rule, the Electorate of Saxony more than any other power in the Empire protected the Protestant faith. After the conclusion of the 1555 Peace of Augsburg that allowed rulers within the Empire to choose either Lutheranism or Catholicism, Saxony was firmly on the Habsburg side. Augustus, who had replaced Maurice as elector after he was killed in battle in 1553, saw himself as the leader of the Lutheran imperial states in whose interest the status quo achieved between Protestants and Catholics was to be preserved.\nThe Ernestine duke John Frederick II continued to claim the electoral privilege that had been revoked from his father. When his ally Wilhelm von Grumbach was placed under an imperial ban, John Frederick refused to act against him, and he too was put under ban a year later. Emperor Ferdinand I entrusted Augustus with the execution of the imperial sentences, and his successful military actions against both Grumbach and John Frederick in 1567 consolidated Electoral Saxony's position in the Empire. The Albertine electoral privilege was never again challenged by the Ernestines.\n### Reformed Protestantism\nThe introduction of Calvinism into Electoral Saxony began under Elector Christian I (r. 1586–1591). In time it prevailed over the orthodox Lutheran party, and the new church order was enforced nationwide. With Christian's death in 1591, the situation changed abruptly. Under a guardianship government established for the underaged Christian II (r. 1591–1611), Calvinist movements in Saxony were opposed with violence. Calvinist supporters were removed from all offices, and the houses of wealthy Calvinists were stormed and set on fire.\nThe growing differences between reformed and orthodox Lutheranism strengthened the influence of the Catholic Counter-Reformation, which was supported by the emperor. Electoral Saxony tried to mediate between the parties in the Empire. In 1608 the Protestant Union was founded as an alliance of the Protestant imperial estates, followed in 1609 by the union of the Catholic imperial estates into the Catholic League.\n## Thirty Years' War\nThe 1618 Defenestration of Prague, in which angry Protestants threw Catholic officials out of a window of Prague Castle, marked the end of a long period of religious peace. Elector John George I (r. 1611–1656) joined the emperor's side with the goal of preserving the status quo of the 1555 Peace of Augsburg. Initially he and the elector of Mainz tried to mediate between Emperor Matthias and the Bohemian estates that were behind the defenestration. After the death of the emperor in March 1619, the Bohemian estates deposed the newly crowned Ferdinand II and elected Frederick V of the Palatinate as their king. John George then agreed with Ferdinand II that Saxony should reconquer the two Bohemian tributary lands of Upper and Lower Lusatia for the emperor. In September 1620 Saxon troops marched into the two Lusatian territories and occupied them without major resistance. Because the emperor could not as agreed reimburse John George for the war costs, he had to give him the two Lusatias as a pledge in 1623.\nSaxony's relations with the emperor then began to deteriorate, in part because Saxony's neutrality was only minimally respected by the imperial troops led by Albrecht von Wallenstein, who on several occasions led marauding troops into Lusatia. John George also disliked the ruthlessly pursued recatholicization in Silesia and Bohemia, although he was unable to do anything about it. In 1631 he finally felt compelled to enter the war against the emperor on the side of Protestant Sweden. The decisive factor for the radical change in policy was the military situation – Swedish troops were already on Saxon soil at the time.\nThe war affected Electoral Saxony especially badly in the west. The Battle of Breitenfeld took place near Leipzig in 1631, as did the Battle of Lützen the following year; both were won by the Protestant side. Leipzig was besieged several times, and its population declined from 17,000 to 14,000. Chemnitz was severely damaged and Freiberg lost its earlier importance. Other urban centers, notably Dresden/Meissen, were spared. Many smaller towns and villages fell victim to massive looting, especially after General Wallenstein gave free hand to his field marshal Heinrich Holk. From August to December 1632 the Croatian light cavalry raided numerous villages, plundering them, maltreating and killing the inhabitants and leaving a swath of destruction in its wake.\nIn 1635 Saxony concluded the Peace of Prague with the emperor and in an appendix to the treaty the next year gained possession of Lusatia. Saxony's territory increased by about 13,000 square kilometers and almost reached its final borders. The devastation caused by the Thirty Years' War nevertheless continued, as battles against the Swedes went on for more than ten years. Electoral Saxony left the direct fighting provisionally with the armistice of 1645 and permanently through a 1646 treaty with Sweden.\nAfter the conclusion on 23 October 1648 of the Peace of Westphalia that ended the Thirty Years' War, Swedish troops were slow in leaving Electoral Saxony. Only after payment of a stipulated tribute of 276,600 imperial thalers on 30 June 1650 did the last of the Swedes leave Leipzig. Life increasingly returned to normal after the hired mercenaries were also released.\nMost of the decrease in Saxony's population due to the war came about indirectly through epidemics and economic factors related to the stagnation of trade, but troop movements and wartime occupations also caused considerable loss in both urban and village populations. According to the historian Karlheinz Blaschke, Saxony's population was reduced by about half as a result of the war. Other authors point out that such a large decrease may have been true in individual regions, but that it cannot be applied to the entire population. The losses were mitigated to a large extent by religious refugees, about 150,000 of whom came to Saxony from Bohemia and Silesia. After the complete devastation of Magdeburg, its importance as a metropolis in the east of the Holy Roman Empire passed to Leipzig and Dresden, as well as to the rising Brandenburg city of Berlin.\nWhen John George II (r. 1656–1680) succeeded his father, Electoral Saxony was still suffering from the economic consequences of the war. It was not until the reign of John George III (r. 1680–1691) that the war damage and dire social welfare situation were overcome. Resettlement of village farms and urban households proved to be the most difficult problem. The first sign of recovery was an increase in tax revenues. Mining, metallurgy, crafts, trade and transportation recovered slowly but steadily. The Saxon estates of the realm had regained influence during the war due to the territorial princes' great need for money. In the second half of the 17th century the electors had to convene the state parliament far more frequently than before, and in 1661 the estates were able to assert their right to self-assembly.\n### Early Baroque\nJohn George I took advantage of the peace to put his territories in order. A clause in his will overrode the decree issued by Albert in 1499 which was intended to prevent a division in the inheritance. Small parts of Electoral Saxony were bequeathed to his three sons Augustus, Christian and Maurice. The bequests established independent duchies that created a collateral line of the family. The duchies of Saxe-Zeitz, Saxe-Merseburg and Saxe-Weissenfels that were created reverted to Electoral Saxony in 1718, 1738 and 1746 respectively. In John George's time, the partitions weakened the electoral state economically, financially and politically, even though from a cultural point of view, new centers with palace buildings, cultural institutions and scientific facilities were established outside Dresden and Leipzig. The collateral lines striving for independence also limited the trend towards absolutist government that was growing in Electoral Saxony.\nLike other similarly-sized states of the time, Electoral Saxony pursued a foreign policy goal of advancing its own rise in a system of states dominated by rivalries. It remained at the side of the Austrian imperial house until the end of the 17th century. After the death of Emperor Ferdinand III in 1657, John George II was imperial vicar (regent) for more than a year until the election of the Habsburg Leopold I. Saxony took part in the Second Northern War against Sweden (1655–1660) and then the Austro-Turkish War (1663–1664). In the same year it became a member of the League of the Rhine and allowed the French to recruit on Saxon territory and to have its troops pass through it. In 1683 Elector John George III participated in the Battle of Vienna that ended the second Turkish siege of the city and ensured its independence.\n## Augustan Age\n### Absolutism and splendor\nOn 27 April 1694 the prince who until then had scarcely made an appearance took over the affairs of state of Saxony as Elector Frederick Augustus I (r. 1694–1733), better known as Augustus II the Strong. Festivities, baroque splendor, art and patronage, as well as lavish grandeur and ostentation characterized both his reign and the period. Augustan Dresden continued to develop into the \"Florence on the Elbe\". The period saw the building of the Zwinger Palace, the Taschenbergpalais, the Pillnitz Palace, the Moritzburg Castle and the Augustus Bridge. New church buildings included the Protestant Frauenkirche by George Bähr and the Catholic Dresden Cathedral of Gaetano Chiaveri.\nThe luxurious life at court eventually exceeded the economic capacity of the state and was ultimately financed at the expense of military strength. The financial problems led to the abandonment of important positions in central Germany. Electoral Saxony's overextension favored the rise of Brandenburg-Prussia to become the second major German and Protestant power in the Empire.\nAugustus reduced the influence of the nobility by establishing a centralized body for executive powers with the help of a privy cabinet created in 1706. It had specialized departments and gradually became the supreme central authority over the competing privy council of the territorial princes. Augustus also introduced a transparent accounting system to verify expenditures and a chamber of accounts that effectively organized the tax system. As a result of it and of the military retrenchment, the national debt was limited and manageable in spite of the high expenditures. A true absolutism did not develop in the Electorate. The inherent contradictions between the elector's claim to absolute power, the nobility's will to assert itself, and the aspirations of the burghers proved to be insurmountable.\nBecause Augustus' son Frederick Augustus II (r. 1733–1763) had no political ambitions, he left the day-to-day political business to his prime minister Heinrich von Brühl. Under Brühl the mismanagement of Saxony's finances increased and budgets became unorganized, resulting in payment defaults and the danger of insolvency.\n### Personal union with Poland\nAfter the death of the Polish king John III Sobieski in 1696, Augustus II the Strong converted to Catholicism and with Habsburg support, military pressure and bribes, won the free election for the kingship in 1697, becoming King Augustus II of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. The political calculation behind a dynastically based personal union with the elective kingdom of Poland-Lithuania was rooted in the aspirations for independence among German territorial princes. Saxony's rulers, like the other powerful imperial princes of the time, wanted to escape the central grip of the Holy Roman emperor and enhance their own dynastic rank in the European state system.\nKing Augustus' increased importance in foreign affairs led to secret negotiations with Denmark and Russia that were directed against Sweden and that ultimately resulted in the Great Northern War of 1700–1721. Augustus' power politics failed due to early defeats; the Saxon invasion of Swedish Livonia in 1700 turned into a military fiasco. The Swedes occupied Electoral Saxony in 1706/07 and forced Augustus to temporarily renounce the Polish crown in the Treaty of Altranstädt. The occupation cost Saxony 35 million Reichsthaler. Augustus regained possession of the Polish crown after the Swedes withdrew from Poland in 1709, but he was unable to assert his claim to Swedish Livonia and fell to the rank of a junior partner of Russia.\nAfter Augustus' death in 1733, disputes over his successor resulted in the War of the Polish Succession, which was won by Saxony. The legitimately elected Stanisław Leszczyński was forced to flee, and Elector Frederick Augustus II was elected as Polish King Augustus III.\nIn 1756, at the beginning of the Seven Years' War, Saxony was invaded by Prussia and remained under occupation and a part of the theater of war until 1763. Augustus III was briefly taken prisoner before being allowed to leave for Poland. He ruled exclusively from Warsaw throughout the war.\nAfter the Treaty of Hubertusburg of 1763 that ended the Third Silesian War (a part of the Seven Years' War), Saxony's position as a European power came to an end. Augustus III and Heinrich von Brühl both died in 1763, and the Saxon-Polish dynastic alliance effectively ended with the Russian-Prussian alliance of 1764. The House of Wettin's official renunciation of the Polish kingship followed in 1765. Elector Frederick Augustus III (r. 1763–1806) rejected a new offer of the royal crown in 1791. Saxony was no longer in a position to play a role among the great powers.\nThe impact of the Seven Years' War on Saxony was devastating. As a central theater of battles and troop movements, it suffered significant destruction and many civilian casualties. An estimated 90,000 Saxons died as a result of the fighting. To avoid forced recruitment, many Saxons left the country. Counterfeiting led to economic losses under which the Leipzig Fair and Saxon's credit suffered.\n## Rétablissement and transformation to a kingdom\nThe Electorate stood on the verge of national bankruptcy after the Hubertusburg Peace. The national debt had reached 49 million thalers, about ten times the year's state revenue. Thomas von Fritsch and the restoration commission of which he was president placed the systematic reduction of the national debt at the center of a Saxon reconstruction program that was called the Rétablissement. Through comprehensive reforms, Saxony not only returned to a budget surplus in 1774 but also achieved at least twenty years of unprecedented economic growth. The Rétablissement went far beyond repairing war damage and became one of the most significant and successful reconstruction efforts in German history.\nAfter taking part in the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778/79), Saxony no longer participated in \"haggling over land\" (Länderschacher) and merely ended a permanent dispute over the area around Glaucha, which brought the state treasury seven million guilders for further state investment. From 1791 on, Elector Frederick Augustus III entered into shifting coalitions which continued beyond Saxony's elevation to a kingdom in 1806. In 1805 the Electorate of Saxony covered 39,425 square kilometers.\nAt the outbreak of the War of the Fourth Coalition against Napoleon in 1806, the Electorate of Saxony was allied with Prussia. Saxon soldiers fought against the Napoleonic armies in the Battle of Jena. After their defeat, the Electorate was occupied and 10,000 Bavarian soldiers and a French city commander moved into Dresden. On 11 December 1806 Saxony concluded the Treaty of Poznań with France, which brought it into French dependence. Electoral Saxony was granted some Prussian territories, joined the Confederation of the Rhine, and was obliged to provide troop contingents for the French wars. Elector Frederick Augustus III of Saxony received the title of king, was from that point allowed to call himself King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony, and ruled the Kingdom of Saxony until 1827, after the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806."], "selected_questions": ["What was the territorial extent of the Electorate of Saxony at its greatest extent?", "Who were the two major lines of the Wettin noble house that divided the Electorate of Saxony in the 16th century?", "What was the significance of the Peace of Prague for the territorial expansion of the Electorate of Saxony?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["At its greatest extent, the Electorate of Saxony covered an area of 34,994 square kilometers (about 13,500 square miles).", "The two major lines of the Wettin noble house that divided the Electorate of Saxony in the 16th century were the Ernestine line and the Albertine line.", "The Peace of Prague, concluded in 1635, was significant for the territorial expansion of the Electorate of Saxony.

{"name": "Qusayr 'Amra", "documents": ["# Qusayr 'Amra\nQusayr 'Amra or Quseir Amra, lit. \"small qasr of 'Amra\", sometimes also named Qasr Amra (قصر عمرة / ALA-LC: Qaṣr ‘Amrah), is the best-known of the desert castles located in present-day eastern Jordan. It was built some time between 723 and 743, by Walid Ibn Yazid, the future Umayyad caliph Walid II, whose dominance of the region was rising at the time. It is considered one of the most important examples of early Islamic art and architecture.\nThe building is actually the remnant of a larger complex that included an actual castle, meant as a royal retreat, without any military function, of which only the foundation remains. What stands today is a small country cabin. It is most notable for the frescoes that remain mainly on the ceilings inside, which depict, among others, a group of rulers, hunting scenes, dancing scenes containing naked women, working craftsmen, the recently discovered \"cycle of Jonah\", and, above one bath chamber, the first known representation of heaven on a hemispherical surface, where the mirror-image of the constellations is accompanied by the figures of the zodiac. This has led to the designation of Qusayr 'Amra as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The bathhouse is also, along with examples in the other desert castles of Jordan, one of the oldest surviving remains of a hammam in the historic Muslim world.\nThat status, and its location along Jordan's major east–west highway, relatively close to Amman, have made it a frequent tourist destination.\n## Location and access\nQasr Amra is on the north side of Jordan's Highway 40, roughly 85 kilometres (53 mi) from Amman and 21 kilometres (13 mi) southwest of Al-Azraq.\nIt is currently within a large area fenced off in barbed wire. An unpaved parking lot is located at the southeast corner, just off the road. A small visitor's center collects admission fees. The castle is located in the west of the enclosed area, below a small rise.\n## Description\nTraces of stone walls used to enclose the site suggest it was part of a 25-hectare (62-acre) complex; there are remains of a castle which could have temporarily housed a garrison of soldiers.\nJust to the southeast of the building is a well 40 metres (130 ft) deep, and traces of the animal-driven lifting mechanism and a dam have been found as well.\nThe architecture of the reception-hall-cum-bathhouse is identical to that of Hammam al-Sarah, also in Jordan, except the latter was erected using finely-cut limestone ashlars (based on the Late Roman architectural tradition), while Amra's bath was erected using rough masonry held together by gypsum-lime mortar (based on the Sasanian architectural tradition).\nIt is a low building made from limestone and basalt. The northern block, two stories high, features a triple-vaulted ceiling over the main entrance on the east facade. The western wings feature smaller vaults or domes.\nToday, Qasr Amra is in a poorer condition than the other desert castles such as Qasr Kharana, with graffiti damaging some frescoes. However, conservation work is underway supported by World Monuments Fund, the Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro, and Jordan's Department of Antiquities.\n## History\n### Construction: who and when\nOne of the six kings depicted is King Roderick of Spain, whose short reign (710-712) was taken to indicate the date of the image, and possibly the building, to around 710. Therefore, for a long time researchers believed that sitting caliph Walid I was the builder and primary user of Qasr Amra, until doubts arose, making specialists believe that one of two princes who later became caliph themselves, Walid or Yazid, were the more likely candidates for that role. The discovery of an inscription during work in 2012 has allowed for the dating of the structure to the two decades between 723 and 743, when it was commissioned by Walid Ibn Yazid, crown prince under caliph Hisham and his successor during a short reign as caliph in 743–744.\nBoth princes spent long periods of time away from Damascus, the Umayyad capital, before assuming the throne. Walid was known to indulge in the sort of sybaritic activities depicted on the frescoes, particularly sitting on the edge of pools listening to music or poetry. He was once entertained by performers dressed as stars and constellations, suggesting a connection to the sky painting in the caldarium. Yazid's mother was a Persian princess, suggesting a familiarity with that culture, and he too was known for similar pleasure-seeking.\nA key considerations in the placement of the desert castles centered on access and proximity to the ancient routes running north from Arabia to Syria. A major route ran from the Arabian city of Tayma via Wadi Sirhan toward the plain of Balqa in Jordan and accounts for the location of Qusayr Amra and other similar fortifications such as Qasr Al-Kharanah and Qasr al-tuba.\n### Rediscovery in 1898\nThe abandoned structure was re-discovered by Alois Musil in 1898, with the frescoes made famous in drawings by the Austrian artist Alphons Leopold Mielich for Musil's book. In the late 1970s a Spanish team restored the frescoes. The castle was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985 under criteria i), iii), and iv) (\"masterpiece of human creative genius\", \"unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition\" and \"an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates a significant stage in human history\").\n## Frescoes\nQasr Amra is most notable for the frescoes on the inside walls.\n### Reception hall\nThe main entry vault has scenes of hunting, fruit and wine consumption, and naked women. Some of the animals shown are not abundant in the region but were more commonly found in Persia, suggesting some influence from that area. One surface depicts the construction of the building. Near the base of one wall a haloed king is shown on a throne. An adjoining section, now in Berlin's Museum of Islamic Art, shows attendants as well as a boat in waters abundant with fish and fowl.\n### Throne apse\nAn image known as the \"six kings\" depicts the Umayyad caliph and the rulers of realms near and far. Based on details and inscriptions in the image, four of the depicted kings are identified as the Byzantine Emperor, the Visigothic king Roderic, the Sassanid Persian Shah, and the Negus of Ethiopia. The last one was for a long time unidentified, speculated to be the Turkish, Chinese, or Indian ruler, and now known to represent the emperor of China. Its intent was unclear. The Greek word ΝΙΚΗ nike, meaning victory, was discovered nearby, suggesting that the \"six kings\" image was meant to suggest the caliph's supremacy over his enemies. Another possible interpretation is that the six figures are depicted in supplication, presumably towards the Caliph who would be seated in the hall.\n### Bath\nThe frescoes in all rooms but the caldarium reflect the advice of contemporary Arab physicians. They believed that baths drained the spirits of the bathers, and that to revive \"the three vital principles in the body, the animal, the spiritual and the natural,\" the bath's walls should be covered with pictures of activities like hunting, of lovers, and of gardens and palm trees.\n#### Apodyterium\nThe apodyterium, or changing room, is decorated with scenes of animals engaging in human activities, particularly performing music. One ambiguous image has an angel gazing down on a shrouded human form. It has often been thought to be a death scene, but some other interpretations have suggested the shroud covers a pair of lovers. Three blackened faces on the ceiling have been thought to represent the stages of life. Christians in the area believe the middle figure is Jesus Christ.\n#### Tepidarium\nOn the walls and ceiling of the tepidarium, or warm bath, are scenes of plants and trees similar to those in the mosaic at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. They are interspersed with naked females in various poses, some bathing a child.\n#### Caldarium\nThe caldarium or hot bath's hemispheric dome has a representation of the heavens in which the zodiac is depicted, among 35 separate identifiable constellations. It is believed to be the earliest image of the night sky painted on anything other than a flat surface. The radii emerge not from the dome's center but, accurately, from the north celestial pole. The angle of the zodiac is depicted accurately as well. The only error discernible in the surviving artwork is the counterclockwise order of the stars, which suggests the image was copied from one on a flat surface."], "selected_questions": ["What is Qusayr 'Amra considered to be an important example of?", "How is the architecture of Qusayr 'Amra different from Hammam al-Sarah?", "What is depicted on the frescoes in the caldarium of Qusayr 'Amra?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Qusayr 'Amra is considered to be an important example of early Islamic art and architecture.", "The architecture of Qusayr 'Amra is different from Hammam al-Sarah in terms of the materials used.

{"name": "John Muir Wilderness", "documents": ["# John Muir Wilderness\nThe John Muir Wilderness is a wilderness area that extends along the crest of the Sierra Nevada of California for 90 miles (140 km), in the Inyo and Sierra National Forests. Established in 1964 by the Wilderness Act and named for naturalist John Muir, it encompasses 652,793 acres (2,641.76 km2). The wilderness lies along the eastern escarpment of the Sierra from near Mammoth Lakes and Devils Postpile National Monument in the north, to Cottonwood Pass near Mount Whitney in the south. The wilderness area also spans the Sierra crest north of Kings Canyon National Park, and extends on the west side of the park down to the Monarch Wilderness.\n## Geography and geology\nThe wilderness contains some of the most spectacular and highest peaks of the Sierra Nevada, with 57 peaks over 13,000 feet (4,000 m) in elevation. The peaks are typically made of granite from the Sierra Nevada Batholith, and are dramatically shaped by glacial action. The southernmost glacier in the United States, the Palisade Glacier, is contained within the wilderness area. Notable east-side glaciated canyons are drained by Rock, McGee and Bishop Creeks.\nThe eastern escarpment in the wilderness rises from 6,000 to 8,000 feet (1,800 to 2,400 m) from base to peak, in 5 to 6 miles (8 to 10 km). The Sierra crest contains peaks from 12,000 to 14,000 feet (3,700 to 4,300 m) in elevation, including Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the continental United States. Other notable mountains in the wilderness area include the Palisades and Mount Humphreys. Mount Muir is located 2 miles south of Mount Whitney. Mount Williamson is the second-highest peak in the wilderness, at 14,375 feet (4,382 m): it rises in one continuous sweep of granite from the floor of the Owens Valley to a peak just east of the main range.\n## Ecology\nThe John Muir Wilderness contains the largest contiguous area above 10,000 feet (3,000 m) in the continental United States. It contains large areas of subalpine meadows and fellfields above 10,800 feet (3,300 m), containing stands of whitebark and foxtail pine. From 9,000 feet (2,700 m) to 10,800 feet (3,300 m), the wilderness is dominated by lodgepole pines. Below the lodgepole forest is forest dominated by Jeffrey pine.\nCommon animals in the wilderness include yellow-bellied marmots, pikas, golden-mantled ground squirrels, Clark's nutcrackers, golden trout, and black bears. The wilderness area also includes California bighorn sheep zoological areas, which are set aside for the protection of the species.\n## Recreation\nThe wilderness contains 589.5 miles (948.7 km) of hiking trails, including the John Muir Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail, which run through the wilderness from north to south.

In the event of the Tyne line being overwhelmed, defending forces were to withdraw to the Derwent Stop Line, 10 miles or so to the south.\n## Tyne Stop Line defensive plan\nAs soon as an invasion was confirmed, members of the 280th Field Company, Royal Engineers (based in Yorkshire), would rapidly advance north via Durham, Leadgate, Ebchester and Hexham and blow up more than 100 road, rail and foot bridges on the Tyne from the Rede Valley to Scotswood. The holes for the charges were already drilled (and the traces of many can still be seen to this day). Road approaches were to be mined and blocked by craters.

{"name": "Nez Perce National Historical Park", "documents": ["# Nez Perce National Historical Park\nThe Nez Perce National Historical Park is a United States National Historical Park comprising 38 sites located across the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington, which include traditional aboriginal lands of the Nez Perce people. The sites are strongly associated with the resistance of Chief Joseph and his band, who in June 1877 migrated from Oregon in an attempt to reach freedom in Canada and avoid being forced on to a reservation. They were pursued by U.S. Army cavalry forces and fought numerous skirmishes against them during the so-called Nez Perce War, which eventually ended with Chief Joseph's surrender in the Montana Territory.\nNez Perce National Historical Park was established in 1965, and a museum was opened at the park headquarters in Spalding, Idaho, in 1983. The 38 discontiguous sites span three main ecoregions, covering a wide range of elevations and climate. Numerous animal species inhabit the park areas, including several that are considered sensitive.\n## History\nThe park commemorates the history, culture, and stories of the Nez Perce. It includes sites associated with the Nez Perce War of 1877, when the people resisted takeover by the United States, and the flight of Chief Joseph and his band. The park is administered overall by the National Park Service, and a number of the sites are managed by other federal and state agencies as well as local communities; the park's headquarters are located in Spalding, Idaho, east of Lewiston.\nThe park was established by Congress in 1965. Construction of the planned headquarters site and museum at Spalding were delayed by land acquisition and federal funding problems. Soon after construction began in September 1979, Native American graves were discovered at the site. Remains and artifacts were preserved in consultation with the Nez Perce. Construction of the visitor center and museum was later restarted. The museum opened in June 1983.\n## Sites\nThe Nez Perce National Historic Park does not follow the format of most national parks, in that it is composed of dozens of sites spread over four states. The 38 sites are linked by the history of the Nez Perce people, rather than by geographic location. Twenty-six of the sites are on or near the Nez Perce Indian Reservation in Idaho and can be toured in one day. Adjacent states hold the other twelve sites.\nSeveral of the sites are connected by the Nez Perce National Historic Trail, managed by the United States Forest Service. It preserves the route taken by Chief Joseph and his band when they tried to reach Canada in 1877.\nThe sites include:\nBattle of Bear Paw – Blaine County, Montana Battle of the Clearwater – Idaho County, Idaho Battle of White Bird Canyon – Idaho County, Idaho Big Hole National Battlefield – Beaverhead County, Montana Camas Meadows Battle Sites – Clark County, Idaho Camas Prairie – Idaho County and Lewis County, Idaho Camp Chopunnish – Idaho County, Idaho Joseph Canyon – Wallowa County, Oregon and Asotin County, Washington Old Chief Joseph Gravesite – Wallowa County, Oregon Weippe Prairie – Weippe, Idaho\n## Ecology\nThe NPNHP sites cover three main ecoregions. The first, found at the sites in the Palouse grasslands and Missouri Basin, is shortgrass prairie. These flat or slightly rolling prairies include rivers and streams, and have an altitude of about 1,000 to 3,500 feet (300 to 1,070 m). The second, found in the plateaus of the Columbia and Snake rivers, is sagebrush steppe at around 3,000 ft in altitude; it includes lava fields and flows. The third, found in the sites in the Blue Mountains, Salmon River Mountains, southwestern Montana and northern Rocky Mountains, is conifer and alpine meadows. These high-elevation sites have lower temperatures and greater precipitation than the other ecoregions.\nNumerous species of mammals, amphibians, reptiles, birds and invertebrates inhabit the various park sites. Several of these species are classified in terms of their status as \"threatened,\" \"endangered\" or \"sensitive\" at the state level. Montana Arctic grayling, mountain plover, swift fox, great grey owl, boreal owl and several fish species are all sensitive species that inhabit the park, while gray wolf and bald eagles are sometimes seen.

{"name": "Old Toronto", "documents": ["# Old Toronto\nOld Toronto is an administrative district and the retronym of the area within the original city limits of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from 1834 to 1998. It was first incorporated as a city in 1834, after being known as the town of York, and became part of York County. Toronto periodically grew in size by annexing adjacent land.\nIn 1954, the City of Toronto became the administrative headquarters for the new, upper-tier Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, created from the southern portion of York County. The lower-tier City continued to expand in size by annexation of surrounding municipalities, until it reached its final boundaries in 1967. In 1998, it was amalgamated with the other cities (York, North York, Etobicoke, Scarborough) in, the remaining borough (East York) in, and the upper-tier municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, into the present-day single-tier City of Toronto. It was not a traditional annexation in which a city absorbs surrounding municipalities but officially continues the core entity; rather, it was a new municipal entity that succeeded the City of Toronto (among others) and covered the territory of Metropolitan Toronto.\nHistorically, \"Old Toronto\" referred to Toronto's boundaries before the Great Toronto Fire of 1904, when most urban development was to the east of Yonge Street. Since the 1998 amalgamation, however, the 1967–1998 area of the lower-tier city is referred to as \"Old Toronto\" or the \"former city of Toronto.\" It is sometimes less accurately referred to as \"downtown\" (Downtown Toronto is located within Old Toronto) or as \"the core.\" Old Toronto has a population density of approximately 8,210 residents per square kilometre, which would rank as Canada’s densest (North America’s second-densest) city with a population over 100,000 if it were still a distinct city.\n## History\nThe former town of York was incorporated on March 6, 1834, reverting to the name Toronto to distinguish it from New York City, as well as about a dozen other localities named \"York\" in the province (including the county in which Toronto was situated), and to dissociate itself from the negative connotation of \"dirty Little York\", a common nickname for the town by its residents. The population was recorded in June 1834 at 9,252.\nIn 1834, Toronto was incorporated with the boundaries of Bathurst Street to the west, 400 yards north of Lot (today's Queen) Street to the north, and Parliament Street to the east. Outside this formal boundary were the \"liberties\", land pre-destined to be used for new wards. These boundaries were today's Dufferin Street to the west, Bloor Street to the north, and the Don River to the east, with a section along the lakeshore east of the Don and south of today's Queen Street to the approximate location of today's Maclean Street. The liberties formally became part of the city in 1859 and the wards were remapped.\nWilliam Lyon Mackenzie, a Reformer, was Toronto's first mayor, a position he only held for one year, losing to Tory Robert Baldwin Sullivan in 1835. Sullivan was replaced by Dr. Thomas David Morrison in 1836. Another Tory, George Gurnett, was elected in 1837. That year, Toronto was the site of the key events of the Upper Canada Rebellion. Mackenzie would eventually lead an assault on Montgomery's Tavern, beginning the Upper Canada Rebellion. The attacks were ineffectual, as British regulars and the Canadian militia in Toronto went out to the camp at Montgomery's Tavern and dispersed the rebels. Mackenzie and some other Reformers escaped to the United States, while other rebel leaders, such as Samuel Lount and Peter Matthews, were hanged. Toronto would thenceforth elect a succession of Tory or Conservative mayors—it was not until the 1850s that a Reform member would be mayor again. Shortly after the rebellion, Toronto was ravaged by its first great fire in 1849. The fire was one of two great fires to occur in the city, with the other occurring in 1904.\nIt is a matter of deep regret that political differences should have run high in this place, and led to most discreditable and disgraceful results. It is not long since guns were discharged from a window in this town at the successful candidates in an election, and the coachman of one of them was actually shot in the body, though not dangerously wounded. But one man was killed on the same occasion; and from the very window whence he received his death, the very flag which shielded his murderer (not only in the commission of his crime, but from its consequences), was displayed again on the occasion of the public ceremony performed by the Governor General, to which I have just adverted. Of all the colours in the rainbow, there is but one which could be so employed: I need not say that flag was orange.— Charles Dickens, commenting on 1841 Toronto Orange violence in American Notes for General Circulation, 1842\nIn their efforts to control the city and its citizens, the Tories were willing to turn to extra-governmental tools of social control, such as the Orange Order in Canada. As historian Gregory Kealey concluded, \"Following the delegitimation of Reform after the Rebellions were suppressed, the Corporation (of Toronto) developed into an impenetrable bastion of Orange-Tory strength.\" By 1844, six of Toronto's ten aldermen were Orangemen, and, over the rest of the 19th century, twenty of twenty-three mayors would be as well. A parliamentary committee reporting on the 1841 Orange Riot in Toronto concluded that the powers granted the Corporation made it ripe for Orange abuse. Orange influence dominated the emerging police force, giving it a \"monopoly of legal violence, and the power to choose when to enforce the law.\" Orange Order violence at elections and other political meetings was a staple of the period. Between 1839 and 1866, the Orange Order was involved in 29 riots in Toronto, of which 16 had direct political inspiration.\nAt its height in 1942, 16 of the 23 members of city council were members of the Orange Order. Every mayor of Toronto in the first half of the 20th century was an Orangeman. This continued until the 1954 election when the Jewish Nathan Phillips defeated radical Orange leader Leslie Howard Saunders.\n### Annexations and amalgamations\nThe boundaries of Toronto remained unchanged into the 1880s. Then followed a series of expansions lasting to the 1910s: Toronto expanded to the west by annexing the Town of Brockton in 1884, the Town of Parkdale in 1889, and properties west to Swansea (such as High Park) by 1893; to the north by annexing Yorkville in 1883, The Annex in 1887, Seaton Village in 1888, Rosedale in 1905, Deer Park in 1908, the City of West Toronto, Bracondale, and Wychwood Park in 1909, Dovercourt Park and Earlscourt in 1910, and Moore Park and North Toronto in 1912; and to the east by annexing Riverdale in 1884, a strip east of Greenwood in 1890, Town of East Toronto (including East Danforth and Upper Beaches) in 1908, an extension east to Victoria Park Avenue in 1909, and the Midway (bounded by Danforth Avenue in north, Greenwood Avenue to west, Queen Street to south and East Toronto western boundaries to the east) in 1909. By 1908, the named wards were abolished, replaced by a simple numbering scheme of Ward 1 to Ward 6.\nBy the 1920s, Toronto stopped annexing suburbs. In 1954, the municipalities in York County south of Steeles Avenue were severed from the county to form the new regional Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, which included Toronto and numerous suburbs. Metropolitan Toronto operated as an upper-tier municipal government whereas Toronto continued to operate as a lower-tier government within Metropolitan Toronto. In 1967, provincial reform of lower-tier municipalities in Metropolitan Toronto saw Toronto annex the municipalities of Forest Hill and Swansea. The City of Toronto remained this size until 1998, when it was formally dissolved and its area amalgamated into the new single-tier City of Toronto. The new City of Toronto was formed from Old Toronto, the five other dissolved municipalities that made up Metropolitan Toronto, and that upper tier itself in 1997.\n## Culture\nThe first Crystal Palace in Toronto, officially named the Palace of Industry, was modelled after the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London, England, and was Toronto's first permanent exhibition hall. Completed in 1858, it was located south of the Provincial Lunatic Asylum, northwest of King and Shaw Streets. It was dismantled in 1878, and the ironwork was used to construct a new Crystal Palace on what would later become Exhibition Place. The second Crystal Palace hosted Toronto's first Industrial Exhibition (the predecessor to the Canadian National Exhibition or CNE) in 1879. By the time it was destroyed in 1906 by fire, it was officially known as the CNE Transportation Building. It was replaced by the Horticulture Building in 1907.\n## Institutions\n### Health care\nOld Toronto was home to a number of hospitals, including Bridgepoint Active Healthcare (originally named House of Refuge, see below), Casey House, Mount Sinai Hospital, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (originally named Princess Margaret Hospital), St. Joseph's Health Centre, St. Michael's Hospital, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto Grace Health Centre, Toronto Western Hospital and Women's College Hospital. Two health care institutions were also established in 1998 by amalgamating previously separate hospitals: the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.\nThe Toronto General Hospital is the oldest operating hospital established in Toronto. It started as a small shed in the old town and was used as a military hospital during the War of 1812, after which it was founded as a permanent institution, York General Hospital, in 1829, at John and King Streets. In 1853–56, a new home for the hospital was built on the north side of Gerrard Street, east of Parliament, using a design by architect William Hay, and relocated to University Avenue at College Street in 1913.\nThe House of Providence on Power Street (between King and Queen Streets) was opened by the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1857 to aid the plight of the desperately poor. It was demolished in 1962 to make way for the Richmond Street exit from the Don Valley Parkway. By that time it was a nursing home, and its residents moved to a new facility at St. Clair and Warden Avenues, known today as Providence Healthcare.\nThe House of Refuge was built in 1860 as a home for \"vagrants, the dissolute, and for idiots.\" The building became a smallpox hospital during an epidemic during the 1870s. It was demolished in 1894, and a new structure called the Riverdale Isolation Hospital was built on the site in 1904, which evolved into the Rivderdale Hospital and later Bridgepoint Health.\n### Public library\nToronto has operated the Toronto Public Library system since 1884. Its collection originated from The Mechanics Institute, which was founded in 1830 by reform Alderman James Lesslie to provide technical and adult education. In 1853 the Institute erected a new permanent home at the corner of Church and Adelaide Streets, but it struggled to attract new paying members. In 1883 the Institute was thus transformed into a municipally supported public reference library. The idea was promoted by alderman John Hallam, but it met considerable resistance in city council. No other city in Canada at this time had a completely free public library. Hallam brought the initiative to a public referendum, and the citizens of Toronto voted in its favour on January 1, 1883. The 5,000-book collection of the Mechanics' Institute became the first books of the newly formed Toronto Public Library.\nAs a result of the 1998 amalgamation of Toronto, the other municipal libraries of Metropolitan Toronto were merged with Toronto Public Library. It also merged with the Metro Toronto Public Library, which operated one branch, the Toronto Reference Library in Old Toronto.\n### Education\nFour public school boards provide primary and secondary education for residents of Old Toronto, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM), Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the Toronto District School Board (TDSB). CSV and TDSB are secular public school boards, operating respectively a French first language institution and English first language institutions. The other two school boards, CSCM and TCDSB, are public separate school boards, operating French first language separate schools and English first language separate schools. Before 1998, the Toronto Board of Education and Conseil des écoles françaises de la communauté urbaine de Toronto had operated public secular schools while the Metropolitan Separate School Board (Les Conseil des écoles catholiques du Grand Toronto) had operated public separate schools. These were reorganized upon the amalgamation into the City of Toronto.\nOld Toronto hosts Toronto Metropolitan University, University of Toronto's St. George Campus, OCAD University, George Brown College and several other post-secondary institutions.\n## Politics\n### Capital\nThe first Upper Canada parliament buildings were built in 1796 at Front and Parliament Streets when the capital of the Province was moved from Niagara-on-the-Lake. These were destroyed in 1813 during an attack on the then-City of York during the War of 1812. A second building was constructed on the same site in 1820, only to be lost to fire in 1824. They were replaced by a new structure built between 1829 and 1832 near Front, John, Simcoe, and Wellington Streets, which saw alterations take place in 1849.\nWith the unification of Upper and Lower Canada in 1840, the building continued to see sporadic periods of usage as the legislature of the Province of Canada until the capital was permanently moved to what is now Ottawa shortly before Confederation in 1867, which saw the formation of the modern-day province of Ontario (the same area as Upper Canada). Upon Confederation, Toronto was selected to be the provincial capital and thus the Front Street building returned to usage as the location of the provincial legislature until the current Legislative Buildings at Queen's Park were completed in 1893. The Front Street building remained vacant until it was demolished in 1903; the Canadian Broadcasting Centre now sits on the site.\nChorley Park, located in the Rosedale neighbourhood, served as the official residence of the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario from 1915 to 1937. The building was demolished in 1961 after it and the lands around it were purchased by the municipal government.\n### Municipal politics\n#### City council\nIn 1833, several prominent reformers had petitioned the House of Assembly to have the town incorporated, which would also have made the position of magistrate elective. The Tory-controlled House struggled to find a means of creating a legitimate electoral system that might nonetheless minimize the chances of reformers being elected. The bill passed on March 6, 1834, proposed two different property qualifications for voting. There was a higher qualification for the election of aldermen (who would also serve as magistrates) and a lower one for common councillors. Two aldermen and two councilmen would be elected from each city ward. This relatively broad electorate was offset by a much higher qualification for election to office, which essentially limited election to the wealthy, much like the old Courts of Quarter Sessions it replaced. The mayor was elected by the aldermen from among their number, and a clear barrier was erected between those of property who served as full magistrates and the rest. Only 230 of the city's 2,929 adult men met this stringent property qualification.\n#### City halls\nThe second market building replaced the original wooden market building in 1831 and ran from King Street to Front Street (the site of the current St. Lawrence Hall, and the St. Lawrence Market North building). It was selected by the first mayor, William Lyon Mackenzie, as city hall. His newspaper, the Colonial Advocate, rented space in the rear. This building, along with much of the surrounding Market Block, was destroyed by fire in the 1849 Cathedral Fire. The site was rebuilt as St. Lawrence Hall in 1850.\nThe second city hall, built in 1845 and renovated in 1850, was known as the New Market House. It served as city hall until 1899. In 1904, the current St. Lawrence Market South building was built, incorporating part of the city hall structure. Toronto third city hall began construction in 1889, and was completed a decade later, in 1899. Old City Hall was also used as a court house (assuming the role of the closed Adelaide Street Court House, closed in 1900), and continues to be used as a dedicated court house. The third city hall was used by the Toronto City Council from 1899 to 1965, when they moved to the completed fourth Toronto City Hall.\n#### Ward system\nThe earliest Toronto neighbourhoods were the five municipal wards that the city was split into in 1834. The wards were named for the patron saints of the four nations of the British Isles (St. George, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, and St. David) and St. Lawrence, a patron saint of Canada (St. Joseph is the principal patron saint of Canada). Today, only St. Lawrence remains a well-known neighbourhood name. The others have attached their names to a variety of still-existing landmarks, including three subway stations. As Toronto grew, more wards were created, still named after prominent saints. St. James Ward is preserved in the modern St. James Town neighbourhood, while the northern ward of St. Paul's has continued to the present as a federal and provincial electoral district.\n## Demographics\nThe population of Old Toronto was 797,642 at the 2016 census, living on a land area of 97.15 km² (37.51 sq mi). According to the 2001 census, the population was 70% Caucasian, 10% Chinese, 5% African-Canadian, 5% South Asian, 3% Filipino, 2% Latin American, 2% Southeast Asian, 1% Korean, and 2% Other."], "selected_questions": ["When was Old Toronto first incorporated as a city?", "Who was Toronto's first mayor?", "What was the population of Old Toronto according to the 2016 census?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Old Toronto was first incorporated as a city in 1834.", "Toronto's first mayor was William Lyon Mackenzie.", "According to the 2016 census, the population of Old Toronto was 797,642."], "InternLM_answers": ["The City of Toronto was first incorporated on March 6, 1834.", "Toronto's first mayor was William Lyon Mackenzie.", "According to the 2016 census, the population of Old Toronto was 869,400."], "human_GPT3.5_answers_D_ann": [["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> Old Toronto is an administrative district and the retronym of the area within the original city limits of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from 1834 to 1998.It was first incorporated as a city in 1834, after being known as the town of York"], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> William Lyon Mackenzie, a Reformer, was Toronto's first mayor, a position he only held for one year, losing to Tory Robert Baldwin Sullivan in 1835"], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> The population of Old Toronto was 797,642 at the 2016 census"]], "human_InternLM_answers_ann": [["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> The former town of York was incorporated on March 6, 1834, reverting to the name Toronto"], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> William Lyon Mackenzie, a Reformer, was Toronto's first mayor, a position he only held for one year, losing to Tory Robert Baldwin Sullivan in 1835"], ["<Hallucination> Contradictory\n<Reference> The population of Old Toronto was 797,642 at the 2016 census\n<Correction>  \"869,400\" to \"797,642\"."]], "language": "en"}

Its construction began in 1666, becoming the last church in the city to be built during the colonial period, and suspended at the stage of foundation construction, it was restarted in 1730 and completed in 1732. Due to its historical value, it was declared a national monument in 1995 along with other buildings in the city.\nAmong its relics, the main altarpiece is still preserved. Under the choir, the temple has a Mudéjar ceiling of indisputable Córdoban influence, as also happens with the alfarje (carved wood ceiling) and with the harneruelo (flat and central part of the coffered ceilings) of the main altar. Carpentry from Cartagena is beautifully represented in the two access doors to the sacristy, also the colonial font of Carrara marble in the sacristy is a masterpiece.

{"name": "Venustiano Carranza, Mexico City", "documents": ["# Venustiano Carranza, Mexico City\nVenustiano Carranza is a borough (demarcación territorial) in the Mexico City. Venustiano Carranza extends from the far eastern portion of the historic center of Mexico City eastward to the Peñón de los Baños and the border dividing the then Federal District from the State of Mexico. Historically, most of the territory was under Lake Texcoco, but over the colonial period into the 20th century, the lake dried up and today the area is completely urbanized. The borough is home to three of Mexico City's major traditional markets, including La Merced, the National Archives of Mexico, the Palacio Legislativo de San Lázaro, the TAPO intercity bus terminal and the Mexico City Airport.\n## Geography and environment\nThe borough is located in the center-east of Mexico City. It borders Gustavo A. Madero, Cuauhtémoc and Iztacalco with the State of Mexico to the east. The territory measures 33.42 km2 (13 sq mi) which is 2.24% of the total of Mexico City. The borough has 2,290 blocks and eighty officially designated neighborhoods.\nIt has an average altitude of 2,240 m (7,349 ft) above sea level with most of the surface flat. The territory is mostly the bed of the former Lake Texcoco with soils of compressed clay over sand, with the exception of the Peñón de los Baños at 2,290 metres (7,513 feet) above sea level, made of basalt . Because it is mostly former lakebed, flooding (especially during the rainy season from June to October) and hailstorms in winter, are not uncommon. Flooding is often caused or exacerbated by the deteriorated drainage system. Aside from the one elevation, the far west of the borough corresponds to the far east of the former Tenochtitlan island. For this reason, about one quarter of the historic center of Mexico City belongs to the borough. It has a semi dry, temperate climate with an average annual temperature of 16 °C (61 °F) and an average rainfall of 600 mm (24 in).\nIn the parks and other green spaces of the borough, trees such as ash, white cedar, cypress, fig and Indian laurel, various scrubs and grasses can be found. Wildlife is limited to birds, rodents, lizards and insects. In 2011, reforestation efforts took place in four areas of the borough, planting 15,000 trees.\n## Neighborhoods\nOne of the notable neighborhoods of the borough is Magdalena Mixhuca . The community was a small island in Lake Texcoco in the pre Hispanic period and eventually became physically connected to the surrounding areas as the lake dried up. However, the area is still marked by the existence of small one-story houses with look very similar often painted some shade of orange, making it look like a small town. The kiosk in the community center is also painted the same color. Next to the plaza it is on is the church of Santa María Magdalena Mixhuca with an image of Mary Magdalene inside. The name Mixhuca comes from Nahuatl and means place of childbirth. The area is dedicated to Mary Magdalene because the first-born daughter of Moctezuma II requested such from Hernán Cortés .\nOther notable neighborhoods include Colonia Balbuena, named after poet Bernardo de Balbuena, La Candelaria de los Patos, which gets its name from the large flocks of ducks that used to live here when the area was still lake, El Parque, Jamaica, Zaragoza, Romero Rubio and Gómez Fárias.\n## Landmarks\nThe borough is home to forty two traditional markets, with over 14,000 individual vendors. This includes three of Mexico City's large traditional markets, La Merced Market, Mercado de Sonora and Mercado Jamaica . La Merced is historically and culturally part of the historic center of Mexico City and is the largest retail food market in the city. The main building is 400 meters long with 3,205 stands mostly selling produce and groceries, meats and fish. There is a smaller section devoted to baskets, rope and handcrafts with another building selling leather, storage containers, ornamental plants and prepared food. This market is located in an area which has been a major market and receiving area since the colonial period. The entire neighborhood was filled in informal stands until the first building was constructed in 1860. Until the mid 20th century, La Merced was the main wholesale market, but this function was moved to the new Central de Abastos market in Iztapalapa. Mercado Jamaica is located in the neighborhood of the same name, next to the metro station named after it. It is known for the sale flowers and ornamental plants, but it also sells produce, groceries, meats and a selection of handcrafts. Mercado Sonora was opened in 1957. It is best known for the section dedicated to herbal medicine and the occult such as items associated with Santa Muerte. This section in located in the back. Other items include live animals, dishes, party favors and plastic items.\nThe National Archives or Archivo General de la Nación (formerly known as the Palacio Negro de Lecumberri) contain a significant part of Mexico's written history. Lecumberri was begun in 1885 as a prison when then San Lázaro area was at the city's periphery. Construction took 15 years and 2.5 million pesos and was inaugurated in 1900 as the most modern prison in Latin America. The prison was the scene of the incarceration and execution of Francisco I. Madero and José María Pino Suárez in 1913. By the 1970s, the prison had as many as 5,000 prisoners in 1,000 cells. The prison was closed by the end of the decade and renovated to its current use.\nThe Palacio Legislativo de San Lázaro was constructed on the former site of the San Lázaro Railroad Station by José López Portillo in the 1970s, opened in 1981. It was constructed to move the legislative body away from the Donceles Legislative Palace in the historic center of Mexico City. The building was nearly destroyed by a fire in 1989 but was restored in 1992. The façade is of red tezontle stone with white marble in the center with the seal of the country prominently displayed. The vestibule contains a collection of murals depicting Mexico's history done by Adolfo Mexiac. The main chamber can seat up to 2000 spectators. When the legislative building was restored, a museum called “Sentimientos de la nación” Legislative Museum was installed. This museum is dedicated to the history of Mexico's government and history up to the present.\nThe main governmental building for the borough is located at Avenida Francisco del Paso y Troncoso in Colonia Jardín Balbuena. These offices were opened in 1974 on the site of the former Balbuena military airfield. The building has four murals painted by Montury such as \"El canto del cisne\", \"Quienes somos\", \"América en llamas\" y \"Dame una palanca y destruiré el mundo\".\nMajor churches in the area include the Sanctuary of Nuestra Señora de San Juan de los Lagos in Colonia 20 de Noviembre, Temple of La Soledad y la Santa Cruz in Colonia Merced Balbuena, the Sanctuary of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe y La Santísima Hostia Sangrante in Colonia El Parque and the Temple of San Antonio Tomatlán in Colonia Morelos. La Soledad de la Santa Cruz Church was built by Augustine monks. This church was expanded between 1750 and 1789 to three naves supported by pilasters and a new main altar was installed. To the south of this church, the Temple of San Jeronimito was constructed in the La Candelaria de los Patos neighborhood.\nThe oldest sports facility of Mexico City was built in the Balbuena area with the name of Venustiano Carranza, inaugurated in 1929. Other sports facilities include Centro Deportivo Moctezuma, Centro Deportivo Ramón López Velarde, Centro Deportivo Felipe \"Tibio Muñoz,” Centro Deportivo Ing. Eduardo Molina, Centro deportivo José Ma. Pino Suárez, Centro Deportivo Velódromo Olímpico, Centro Deportivo Plutarco Elías Calles and Centro Deportivo Oceanía.\nThe Centro Cultural Carranza was inaugurated in 2011 in Colonia Jardín Balbuena with the aim of making it the most important recreational and cultural center in the center east of the Federal District.\nIn addition, the borough contains about one hundred statues, plazas, buildings and gardens which function as monuments to the history of the borough and of Mexico. These include the monument to General Carranza in front of the borough hall, a monument to Simón Bolívar in Jardín Simón Bolívar, a plaque and medallions marking the place where Francisco I. Madero and José María Pino Suárez were executed, and one to Mahatma Gandhi .\nThe super-regional mall Encuentro Oceanía, including Mexico's first IKEA store, opened in the borough in 2021.\n## Reenactment of the Battle of Puebla\nThe Battle of Puebla has been reenacted each year at the Peñón de los Baños since 1930. Residents of this area dress as the Mexican forces, called Zacapoaxtlas and the French army and even includes the firing of cannons with blanks for effect. The reenactment is performed by hundreds of residents of three neighborhoods around Peñón de los Baños, with the event occurring in the neighborhood of that name. The divide to represent the French army and the band of peasants called Zacapoaxtlas along with Mexican soldiers which won the historical battle. The event begins early in the morning on May 5 with a salute to the Mexican flag and a parade to the Peñón de los Baños mountain. The first act occurs in Barrio del Carmen, then another act to commemorate the Treaty of Loreto and the Treaty of Guadalupe on Hidalgo and Chihualcan Streets. After this, there is a large shared banquet with food provided by area residents to the mock soldiers. Then there is an inspection of the troops by one playing General Zaragoza, with a tradition of cutting the hair of a new member of the troops for “lice.” The last battle occurs in the evening with the French troops climbing on airport side and the Mexican troops on the Río Consulado side. It is at this time that cannons with blanks are fired. When the French are defeated, they run down the mountain and through the Barrio del Carmen where they are chased and then “executed” at the area cemetery. After the day's events, there is a festival, dance and carnival.\n## History\n### Pre Hispanic era\nThe emblem of the borough is the former Aztec glyph used to mark a village name Xochicán as it appears in the Mendocino Codex. The flower image means “place of fragrant flowers.”\nExcept for the far west which was part of the island of Tenochtitlan, the Peñón de los Baños and a couple of very small islands in-between, the territory of the borough was covered by Lake Texcoco from the pre Hispanic period into the colonial period. The oldest human settlements in the area were located in the Mixuhca and Peñón de los Baños, which were both originally islands in Lake Texcoco. The eastern end of Tenochtitlan was associated with docks and markets that handled the produce and other items that came over the Lake's waters into the city from other parts of the Valley of Mexico such as Texcoco, Chalco and Xochimilco. The lake in this area also contained part of the Nezahualcoyotl Dike, built to separate the shallow waters.\nThe small islands on the lake were also inhabited. One of these was Mexicaltzingo, where the leader of Culhuacán allowed the Mexica to live for a while in exchange for military service. Today this area is at the intersection of Calzada de la Viga and Ermita Iztapalapa. Another area, Mixuhca, was a very small island in the lake and where it is said that one of the sons of Moctezuma II was born. The name is derived from Mixiuhtlán, which means “place of birth” for this reason. The Cerro el Peñón de los Baños was a recreational area for Aztec emperors. It contained a number of hot springs with high mineral content believed to be curative.\n### Colonial era\nAfter the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Spanish laid out their own capital over the ruins of Tenochtitlán. The eastern end of this city corresponds to the La Merced, San Lázaro and Candelario de los Patos neighborhoods. However, these areas were overpopulated and un-hygienic because of the low, muddy condition of the lands here next to the lake, constantly subject to flooding.\nIn the 17th century, the San Lazaro dike continued to define the border of Lake Texcoco with firm land. However, the process of the lake's desiccation was already evident, expanding the island to allow Mexico City to grow eastward. The drying of the lake lead to the creation of a network of canals, of which the Jamaica and La Viga Canals were most important from the colonial period to the early 20th century. The La Viga Canal linked the La Merced market area to agricultural area southeast of the city, with docks for the canoes called “trajineras” right next to the market.\nIn the 18th century, the San Antonio Tomatlán and La Candelaria churches were built in the neighborhoods of San Lázaro and Candelaria de los Patos.\n### Independence to the present\nDuring the 19th century, the lake continued to dry up, expanding Mexico City east. One of the roads built on this “new” land was Calzada Ignacio Zaragoza, which today leads to the highway to Puebla and Veracruz. Whether covered in lake or not, the territory of the borough became part of the Federal District when it was created in 1824 and has remained since. In the latter part of the century, a number of Mexico's new rail lines terminated at the San Lázaro station, connecting Mexico City with Cuautla and Cuernavaca . The urbanized area extended to what is now the Avenida Congreso de la Unión, with the formation of neighborhoods such as San Lázaro, Santo Tómas, Manzanares, La Soledad, Morelos and Moctezuma. However, much of the land in the 19th century was still swampy with the exception of the far west and the Peñón de los Baños. By 1885, the area was drier but was sparsely populated. A prison was also built in a neighborhood called Lecumberri between 1885 and 1900.\nAt the end of the 19th century, Mexico City grew east with the establishment of Colonia Morelos, Colonia Penitenciaría and Romero Rubio. Most of the development was working class housing and industrial facilities. Most of the industries were initially connected with food processing and other activities related to the La Merced and Jamaica markets. This would bring the city's limits to Eduardo Molina and Avenida Congreso de la Unión by the beginning of the 20th century. Avenida Circunvalación, next to the La Merced Market, still connected to the La Viga Canal. What is now the borough then belonged to two districts: Mexico City proper and the municipality of Guadalupe Hidalgo.\nFrancisco I. Madero and Pino Suárez were executed next to Lecumberri prison in 1913.\nIn the 1920s, Calzada Ignacio Zarragoza was built to connect to the city center to the Puebla highway. This main road spurred the development of more subdivisions expanding the urban sprawl east. A large amount of land in this area belonged to a man named Alberto Braniff, who provided it to establish Mexico City's first private airstrip in 1909, which became the Aeropuerto Central de la Ciudad de México in 1943. In 1954, the airport relocated, expanded and was reconditioned for international flights to become the Mexico City International Airport. This airport prompted the development of warehouses, hotels, and offices in the area.\nIn the 1950s Viaducto Miguel Alemán was constructed after encasing the Tacubaya, Piedadad and Becerra rivers in concrete. The La Merced market was expanded and the Mercado Sonora was built. In the mid 20th century, the process of lake drying and new subdivisions was still ongoing, with Colonia Cuatro Arboles begun in 1945, only five years after the lake in this area disappeared.\nThe modern borough was created in 1970, when the center of Mexico City was split into a four boroughs with the other three being Benito Juárez, Cuauhtémoc and Miguel Hidalgo . The borough was named to honor Mexican Revolution General Venustiano Carranza . By the end of the decade, the entire territory of the borough was urbanized with the exception of the Peñón de los Baños and a reservoir area called the Bordo de Xochiaca, which is now mostly green space.\nBy 1982, informal stalls around the La Merced Market had invaded over 530,000 m2 (5,704,873 sq ft) and was threatening to increase indefinitely. This prompted the end of the market as the city's main retail center in favor of a new market, Central de Abastos in Iztapalapa. La Merced remains the largest retail market for foodstuffs in Mexico City.\nIn 2011, the borough broke the record for the world's largest torta sandwich, which measured fifty meters long, weighed 650 kg (1,433 lb) and was put together in three minutes 57 seconds with seventy different ingredients. The sandwich was created as part of the annual Feria de la Torta.\n## Demographics\nSince the 1990s, the borough has had a decrease in population, down from 462,806 from 2000. The borough's population accounted for 10.4% of the District's total in 1970. It accounted for 5.4% in 2000. One main reason for the decrease is the conversion of land from residential to commercial use.\nThe dominant religion is Roman Catholicism with over 90% of the population professing this faith. As of 2005, 4,489 people spoke an indigenous language, 1.1% of the total.\n## Education\nThere are 456 schools in the borough: 156 preschools, 200 primary schools, 73 secondary schools, 8 vocational high schools and 19 high schools. However, About eighty percent of the population has an education of less than high school level.\nPublic high schools of the Instituto de Educación Media Superior del Distrito Federal (IEMS) include:\nEscuela Preparatoria Venustiano Carranza \"José Revueltas Sánchez\"\n## Socioeconomics\nAbout 54% of the total population twelve or over is economically active. Most workers are between 35 and 39 years of age. As of 2000, over 98% of the working population was employed in either the formal or informal economies. Just under 80% are employed in commerce, 17.5% are employed in manufacturing and construction and .1% in agriculture.\nThe number of housing units in the borough has risen from 112200 units with an average occupancy of 3.3 in 1950 to 117800 units with 4.4 occupants in 1990. As of 1995, the average residential building was fifty years old. From 1990 to 2005, the numbers changed only slightly with 118400 units and 3.9 people per household. The improvement has much to with the decreasing population. Sewerage and electricity is available in over 97% of residential units but running water exists in just under 87%. Those without running water in the apartment have shared source of supply.\n## Transportation\n### TAPO\nThe Terminal de Autobuses de Pasajeros de Oriente, better known as TAPO is the main bus terminal for interstate travel to the east and southeast. It is located next to Metro San Lázaro and marked by its very large dome covering the structure. It was constructed by architect Juan José Díaz Infance and inaugurated in 1978. The outer rim of the circular interior contains ticket counters and boarding areas for bus lines such as Autobuses Unidos. The center contains a food court and other businesses.\n### Mexico City airport\nMexico City International Airport, known officially as Aeropuerto Internacional de Benito Juárez, is the main airport for Mexico City. It was formally named after the 19th century president Benito Juárez in 2006. The airport is owned by Grupo Aeroportuario de la Ciudad de México and operated by Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares, the government-owned corporation, who also operates 21 others airports through Mexico. It is the country's busiest airport with 32 domestic and international airlines and offers direct flights to more than 100 destinations worldwide. In 2010, the airport served 24,130,535 passengers.\n### Other transportation\nIn total, the borough has 4,958 roads, 5.1% of the total of the Federal District. The most important roads include Anillo Periférico, Circuito Interior, Calzada Ignacio Zaragoza and Viaducto Miguel Alemán. Next in importance are Fray Servando Teresa de Mier, Eje 1 Oriente, Eje 2 Oriente (Avenida Congreso de la Unión ), Eje 3 Oriente, Eje 3 Sur, Eje 2 Sur, Eje 1 Norte, and Eje 2 Norte.\nThe high concentration of people and businesses has resulted in an extensive public transportation network which includes the Mexico City Metro, trolleybuses and various bus lines. The Metro lines that cross the borough are Line 1, Line 4, Line 5, Line 9, and Line B, with thirty six stations within borough limits."], "selected_questions": ["What is the average altitude of Venustiano Carranza, Mexico City?", "Which borough borders Venustiano Carranza to the east?", "What is the dominant religion in Venustiano Carranza?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The average altitude of Venustiano Carranza, Mexico City is 2,240 meters (7,349 feet) above sea level.", "The borough that borders Venustiano Carranza to the east is Iztacalco.", "The dominant religion in Venustiano Carranza is Roman Catholicism, with over 90% of the population professing this faith."], "InternLM_answers": ["The average altitude of Venustiano Carranza, Mexico City is 2,240 meters above sea level.", "Venustiano Carranza borders with Iztacalco to the east.", "Venustiano Carranza is a municipality in the state of Chiapas in Mexico.

{"name": "Crown of Aragon", "documents": ["# Crown of Aragon\nThe Crown of Aragon (UK: /ˈærəɡən/ ARR-ə-gən, US: /-ɡɒn/ -⁠gon) was a composite monarchy ruled by one king, originated by the dynastic union of the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona and ended as a consequence of the War of the Spanish Succession. At the height of its power in the 14th and 15th centuries, the Crown of Aragon was a thalassocracy controlling a large portion of present-day eastern Spain, parts of what is now southern France, and a Mediterranean empire which included the Balearic Islands, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, Southern Italy (from 1442) and parts of Greece (until 1388).\nThe component realms of the Crown were not united politically except at the level of the king, who ruled over each autonomous polity according to its own laws, raising funds under each tax structure, dealing separately with each Corts or Cortes, particularly the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia, the Kingdom of Majorca, and the Kingdom of Valencia. The larger Crown of Aragon must not be confused with one of its constituent parts, the Kingdom of Aragon, from which it takes its name.\nIn 1469, a new dynastic union of the Crown of Aragon with the Crown of Castile by the Catholic Monarchs, joining what contemporaries referred to as \"the Spains\", led to what would become the Spanish composite monarchy under Habsburg monarchs. The Aragonese Crown continued existing until it was abolished by the Nueva Planta decrees issued by King Philip V in 1716 as a consequence of the defeat of Archduke Charles (as Charles III of Aragon) in the War of the Spanish Succession.\n## Context\nFormally, the political center of the Crown of Aragon was Zaragoza, where kings were crowned at La Seo Cathedral. The 'de facto' capital and leading cultural, administrative and economic centre of the Crown of Aragon was Barcelona, followed by Valencia. Finally, Palma (Majorca) was an additional important city and seaport.\nThe Crown of Aragon eventually included the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia (until the 12th century the County of Barcelona and others), the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, the Kingdom of Sicily, Malta, the Kingdom of Naples and Kingdom of Sardinia. For brief periods the Crown of Aragon also controlled Montpellier, Provence, Corsica, and the twin Duchy of Athens and Neopatras in Latin Greece.\nThe countries that are today known as Spain and Portugal spent the Middle Ages after 722 in an intermittent struggle called the Reconquista. This struggle pitted the northern Christian kingdoms against the Islamic taifa petty kingdoms of Al-Andalus in the south, and against each other.\nIn the Late Middle Ages, the expansion of the Aragonese Crown southwards met with the Castilian army advancing eastward toward the region of Murcia. Subsequently, the Aragonese Crown focused on the Mediterranean, governing as far afield as Greece and the Barbary Coast, whereas Portugal, which completed its Reconquista in 1249, would focus on the Atlantic Ocean. Mercenaries from the territories in the Crown, known as Almogavars participated in the creation of this Mediterranean empire, and later found employment in countries all across southern Europe.\nThe Crown of Aragon has been considered an empire which ruled in the Mediterranean for hundreds of years, with thalassocratic power to setting rules over the entire sea, (as documented, for instance, in the Llibre del Consolat del Mar or Book of the Consulate of the Sea, written in Catalan, is one of the oldest compilations of maritime laws in the world). The Crown of Aragon was indeed, at its height, one of the major powers in Europe.\nHowever, the different territories were only connected through the person of the monarch, an aspect of empire seen as early as Achaemenid Persia. A modern historian, Juan de Contreras y Lopez de Ayala, Marqués de Lozoya described the Crown of Aragon as being more like a confederacy than a centralised kingdom.\n### Origin\nThe Crown of Aragon originated in 1137, when the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona (along with the County of Provence, Girona, Cerdanya, Osona and other territories) merged by dynastic union upon the marriage of Petronilla of Aragon and Raymond Berenguer IV of Barcelona; their individual titles combined in the person of their son Alfonso II of Aragon, who ascended to the throne in 1162. This union respected the existing institutions and parliaments of both territories. The combined state was initially known as Regno, Dominio et Corona Aragonum et Catalonie, and later as Corona Regum Aragoniae, Corona Aragonum or simply Aragon.\nPetronilla's father King Ramiro, \"The Monk\" (reigned 1134–1137) who was raised in the Monastery of Saint Pons de Thomières, Viscounty of Béziers as a Benedictine monk was the youngest of three brothers. His brothers Peter I (reigned 1094–1104) and Alfonso I El Batallador (The Battler, reigned 1104–1134) had bravely fought against Castile for hegemony in the Iberian peninsula. Upon the death of Alfonso I, the Aragonese nobility that campaigned close to him feared being overwhelmed by the influence of Castile. And so, Ramiro was forced to leave his monastic life and proclaim himself King of Aragon. He married Agnes, sister of the Duke of Aquitaine and betrothed his only daughter Petronilla of Aragon to Raymond Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona. The wedding agreement provided Berenguer with the title of Princeps Aragonum and Dominator Aragonensis (Ruler of the Kingdom and Commander of the Aragonese Military) but the title of King of Aragon was reserved for Ramiro II and Berenguer's future sons.\nRaymond Berenguer IV, the first ruler of the united dynasty, called himself Count of Barcelona and \"Prince of Aragon\".\n### Expansion\nAlfonso II inherited two realms and with them, two different expansion processes. The House of Jiménez looked south in a battle against Castile for the control of the middle valley of the Ebro in the Iberian peninsula. The House of Barcelona looked north to its origins, Occitania, where through family ties it had significant influence, especially in Toulouse, Provence and Foix, towards the south along the Mediterranean coast and towards the Mediterranean sea.\nSoon, Alfonso II of Aragon and Barcelona committed to conquering Valencia as the Aragonese nobility demanded. Like his father, he gave priority to the expansion and consolidation of the House of Barcelona's influence in Occitania.\nAlfonso II signed the treaties of Cazorla, a multilateral treaty between Navarre, Aragón, León, Portugal, and Castile to redefine the frontiers and zones of expansion of each kingdom. Alfonso II assured Valencia by renouncing the Aragonese rights of annexing Murcia in exchange for securing the Aragonese frontier with Castile. This action should be seen as result of the aforementioned priority given over the Occitan and Catalan dominions of the Crown of Aragon.\nFrom the 9th century, the dukes of Aquitaine, the kings of Navarre, the counts of Foix, the counts of Toulouse and the counts of Barcelona were rivals in their attempts at controlling the various counties of the Hispanic Marches and pays of Occitania. And the House of Barcelona succeeded in extending its influence to the area that is now south of France through strong family ties, in the areas of the County of Provence, County of Toulouse and County of Foix. The rebellion of the Cathars or Albigensians, who rejected the authority and teachings of the Catholic Church, led to the loss of these possessions in southern France. Pope Innocent III called upon Philip II of France to suppress the Albigensians—the Albigensian Crusade, which led to bringing Occitania firmly under the control of the King of France, and the Capetian dynasty from northern France.\nPeter II of Aragon returned from the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in autumn 1212 to find that Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, had conquered Toulouse, exiling Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, who was Peter's brother-in-law and vassal. Peter's army crossed the Pyrenees and arrived at Muret where they were joined by Raymond of Foix and Raymond of Toulouse's forces, in September 1213 to confront Montfort's army. The Battle of Muret began on 12 September 1213. The Catalan, Aragonese and Occitan forces were disorganised and disintegrated under the assault of Montfort's squadrons. Peter himself was caught in the thick of fighting, and died as a result of a foolhardy act of bravado. Thus, the nobility of Toulouse, Foix and other vassals of the Crown of Aragon were defeated. The conflict concluded with the Treaty of Meaux-Paris in 1229, in which the Crown of Aragon agreed to renounce its rights over the south of Occitania with the integration of these territories into the dominions of the King of France.\nKing James I (13th century) returned to an era of expansion to the South, by conquering and incorporating Majorca, Ibiza, and a good share of the Kingdom of Valencia into the Crown. With the Treaty of Corbeil (1258), which was based upon the principle of natural frontiers, the Capetians were recognized as heirs of the Carolingian dynasty, and the Capetian king Louis IX renounced any claim of feudal overlordship over Catalonia. The general principle was clear, Catalan influence north of the Pyrenees, beyond the Roussillon, Vallespir, Conflent and Capcir, was to cease. James I had realized that wasting his forces and distracting his energies in attempts to keep a footing in France would only end in disaster. In January 1266, James I besieged and captured Murcia, then settled his own men, mostly Catalans, there; and handed Murcia over to Castile with the treaty of Cazorla.\nThe Kingdom of Majorca, including the Balearic Islands, and the counties of Cerdanya and Roussillon-Vallespir and the city of Montpellier, was held independently from 1276 to 1279 by James II of Majorca and as a vassal of the Crown of Aragon after that date until 1349, becoming a full member of the Crown of Aragon from 1349.\nValencia was finally made a new kingdom with its own institutions and not an extension of Aragón as the Aragonese noblemen had intended since even before the creation of the Crown of Aragon. The Kingdom of Valencia became the third member of the crown together with Aragon and Catalonia. The Kingdom of Majorca had an independent status with its own kings until 1349. In 1282, the Sicilians rose up against the second dynasty of the Angevins on the Sicilian Vespers and massacred the garrison soldiers throughout the island. Peter III responded to their call, and landed in Trapani to an enthusiastic welcome five months later. This caused Pope Martin IV to excommunicate the king, place Sicily under interdiction, and offer the kingdom of Aragon to a son of Philip III of France.\nWhen Peter III refused to impose the Charters of Aragon in Valencia, the nobles and towns united in Zaragoza to demand a confirmation of their privileges, which the king had to accept in 1283. Thus began the Union of Aragon, which developed the power of the Justícia to mediate between the king and the Aragonese bourgeois.\nWhen James II of Aragon completed the conquest of the kingdom of Valencia, the Crown of Aragon established itself as one of the major powers in Europe.\nIn 1297, to solve the dispute between the Anjevins and the Aragonese over Sicily, Pope Boniface VIII created ex novo a Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica and entrusted it as a fief to the Aragonese King James II, ignoring already existing, indigenous states. In 1324, James II finally started to seize the Pisan territories in the former states of Cagliari and Gallura. In 1347 Aragon made war on the Genoese Doria and Malaspina houses, which controlled most of the lands of the former Logudoro state in north-western Sardinia, and added them to its direct domains. The Giudicato of Arborea, the only remaining independent Sardinian state, proved far more difficult to subdue. The rulers of Arborea developed the ambition to unite all of Sardinia under their rule and create a single Sardinian state, and at a certain point (1368–1388, 1392–1409) almost managed to drive the Aragonese out. The war between Arborea and Aragon was fought on and off for more than 100 years; this situation lasted until 1409, when the army of Arborea suffered a heavy defeat by the Aragonese army in the Battle of Sanluri; the capital Oristano was lost in 1410. After some years during which Arborean rulers failed to organise a successful resurgence, they sold their remaining rights for 100,000 gold florins, and by 1420 the Aragonese Kingdom of Sardinia finally extended throughout the island. The subduing of Sardinia having taken a century, Corsica, which had never been wrested from the Genoese, was dropped from the formal title of the Kingdom.\nThrough the marriage of Peter IV to Maria of Sicily (1381), the Kingdom of Sicily, as well as the duchies of Athens and Neopatria, were finally implemented more firmly into the Crown. The Greek possessions were permanently lost to Nerio I Acciaioli in 1388 and Sicily was dissociated in the hands of Martin I from 1395 to 1409, but the Kingdom of Naples was added finally in 1442 by the conquest led by Alfonso V.\nThe King's possessions outside of the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands were ruled by proxy through local elites as petty kingdoms, rather than subjected directly to a centralised government. They were more an economic part of the Crown of Aragon than a political one.\nThe fact that the King was keen on settling new kingdoms instead of merely expanding the existing kingdoms was a part of a power struggle that pitted the interests of the king against those of the existing nobility. This process was also under way in most of the European states that successfully effected the transition to the Early Modern state. Thus, the new territories gained from the Moors—namely Valencia and Majorca—were given furs as an instrument of self-government in order to limit the power of nobility in these new acquisitions and, at the same time, increase their allegiance to the monarchy itself. The trend in the neighbouring kingdom of Castile was quite similar, both kingdoms giving impetus to the Reconquista by granting different grades of self-government either to cities or territories, instead of placing the new territories under the direct rule of nobility.\n### Union with Castile\nIn 1410, King Martin I died without living descendants or heirs. As a result, by the Pact of Caspe, Ferdinand of Antequera from the Castilian dynasty of Trastámara, received the Crown of Aragon as Ferdinand I of Aragon.\nLater, his grandson King Ferdinand II of Aragon recovered the northern Catalan counties—Roussillon and Cerdagne—which had been lost to France as well as the kingdom of Navarre, which had recently joined the Crown of Aragon but had been lost after internal dynastic disputes.\nIn 1469, Ferdinand married Infanta Isabella of Castile, half-sister of King Henry IV of Castile, who became Queen of Castile and León after Henry's death in 1474. Their marriage was a dynastic union which became the constituent event for the dawn of the Kingdom of Spain. At that point both the Castile and the Crown of Aragon remained distinct territories, each keeping its own traditional institutions, parliaments and laws. The process of territorial consolidation was completed when King Charles I, known as Emperor Charles V, in 1516 united all the kingdoms on the Iberian peninsula, save the Kingdoms of Portugal and the Algarve, under one monarch—his co-monarch and mother Queen Joanna I in confinement—thereby furthering the creation of the Spanish state, albeit a decentralised one.\n### Dissolution\nThe literary evocation of past splendour recalls correctly the great age of the 13th and 14th centuries, when Majorca, Valencia and Sicily were conquered, the population growth could be handled without social conflict, and the urban prosperity, which peaked in 1345, created the institutional and cultural achievements of the Crown. The Aragonese crown's wealth and power stagnated and its authority was steadily transferred to the new Spanish crown after that date—the demographic growth was partially offset by the expulsion of the Jews from Spain (1492), Muslims (1502) and the expulsion of the Moriscos (1609). It was unable to prevent the loss of Roussillon in 1659, the loss of Minorca and its Italian domains in 1707–1716, and the imposition of French language on Roussillon (1700) and Castilian as the language of government in all the old Aragonese Crown lands in Spain (1707–1716).\nThe Crown of Aragon and its institutions were abolished in 1716 only after the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) by the Nueva Planta decrees, issued by Philip V of Spain. The old regime was swept away, the administration was subsumed into the Castilian administration, the lands of the Crown were united formally with those of Castile to legally form a single state, the kingdom of Spain, as it moved towards a centralized government under the new Bourbon dynasty.\n### Nationalist revisionism\nSome of the nationalist movements in Spain consider the former kingdoms of the Crown of Aragon to be the foundation of their nations, the Catalan nationalist movement being the most prominent. Spanish nationalism, on the other hand, tends to place more importance on the later dynastic union with the Crown of Castile, considering it the origin of one Spanish nation.\nThe reprisals inflicted on the territories that had fought against Philip V in the War of Succession is given by some Valencian nationalists and Catalan nationalists as an argument against the centralism of Spanish nationalism and in favor of federalism, confederation, or even independence. Some Catalans associated their ancient privileges with their Generalitat and resistance to Castile. Because restoration of fueros was one of its tenets, Carlism won support in the lands of the Crown of Aragon during the 19th century.\nThe Romanticism of the 19th century Catalan Renaixença movement evoked a \"Pyrenean realm\" that corresponded more to the vision of 13th century troubadours than to the historical reality of the Crown. This vision survives today as \"a nostalgic programme of politicised culture\". Thus, the history of the Crown of Aragon remains a politically loaded topic in modern Spain, especially when it comes to asserting the level of independence enjoyed by constituents of the Crown, like the Principality of Catalonia, which is sometimes used to justify the level of autonomy (or independence) that should be enjoyed by contemporary Catalonia and other territories.\n## Pennon\nThe origin of Coat of arms of the Crown of Aragon is the familiar coat of the Counts of Barcelona and Kings of Aragon. The Pennon was used exclusively by the monarchs of the Crown and was expressive of their sovereignty. James III of Majorca, vassal of the Kingdom of Aragon, used a coat of arms with four bars, as seen on the Leges palatinae miniatures.\n## Institutions\nAragon, Catalonia and Valencia each had a legislative body, known as the Cortes in Aragon or Corts in Catalonia and Valencia. A Diputación del General or Diputació del General was established in each, becoming known as a Generalidad in Aragon and Generalitat in Catalonia and Valencia. From the 15th century onwards, every realm of the Crown was granted its own Royal Audience.\n## Capital\nThe house of the Crown was the Cathedral of the Savior of Zaragoza from Peter II (12th century). The parliament used to gather at Monzón (13th to 16th centuries), the remaining meetings took place at Fraga, Zaragoza, Calatayud and Tarazona. The councillor headquarters were located at Barcelona (13th to 16th centuries) and Naples during the kingdom of Alfonso V.\nOn the other hand, the General Archive of the Crown of Aragon, which was the official repository of royal documentation of the Crown since the reign of Alfonso II (12th century), was located in the Monastery of Santa María de Sigena until the year 1301 and then moved to Barcelona.\nIn the early 15th century, the de facto capital was Valencia until Alfonso V came to the throne. During the 15th and the 16th centuries, the Crown's de facto capital was Naples. After Alfonso V of Aragon, Ferdinand II of Aragon settled the capital in Naples. Alfonso, in particular, wanted to transform Naples into a real Mediterranean capital and lavished huge sums to embellish it further. Later the courts were itinerant until Philip II of Spain. The Spanish historian Domingo Buesa Conde has argued that Zaragoza ought to be considered the permanent political capital, but not the economic or administrative capital, owing to the obligation for kings to be crowned at the Cathedral of the Savior of Zaragoza.\n## Culture\nDuring the Crown of Aragon, the Catalan culture and language underwent a vigorous expansion. During the period of trade, Occitan-Catalan contributions to Maltese occurred.\nKing Fernando II and Queen Isabella, as the Catholic Monarchs who began the Inquisition, were contrary to the more plural development that preceded in the Crown of Aragon. The previous religious background was described as \"longstanding tradition of Mudejarism, the royal sanctioning and protection of subject Muslim populations within Christian realms.\" Aesthetic Mudéjar architecture of Aragon has been observed as demonstrating the influence of Andalusian and Arab culture in Aragon proper. Gothic architecture was also developed.\nThe Mediterranean Lingua Franca was a mixed language used widely for commerce and diplomacy and was also current among slaves of the bagnio, Barbary pirates and European renegades in precolonial Algiers. Among the speakers who created the language, also called Sabir, were Muslims from Aragon called \"Tagarins\" (a term mentioned by Miguel Cervantes). Historically, the first to use it were the Genoese and Venetian trading colonies in the eastern Mediterranean after the year 1000.\nAs the use of Lingua Franca spread in the Mediterranean, dialectal fragmentation emerged, the main difference being more use of Italian and Provençal vocabulary in the Middle East, while Ibero-Romance lexical material dominated in the Maghreb. After France became the dominant power in the latter area in the 19th century, Algerian Lingua Franca was heavily gallicised (to the extent that locals are reported having believed that they spoke French when conversing in Lingua Franca with the Frenchmen, who in turn thought they were speaking Arabic), and this version of the language was spoken into the nineteen hundreds...\nThe similarities contribute to discussions of the classification of Lingua Franca as a language. Although its official classification is that of a pidgin, some scholars adamantly oppose that classification and believe it would be better viewed as an interlanguage of Italian.\nLinguist Steven Dworkin hypothesized that Catalan was the point of entry for Mediterranean Lingua Franca terms into Spain, arguably the source of several Italian and Arabic loanwords in Spanish, citing the DCECH.\n## Composition\nThe crown was made up of the following territories (which are nowadays parts of the modern countries of Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Malta, and Andorra).\nSort by \"Earliest annexion\" to see the states in the chronological order they were joined to the crown.\n## Coat of arms of the kings of the Crown of Aragon\nCoat of arms from Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona to Alfonso II of Aragon Coat of arms from Alfonso II of Aragon to Peter II of Aragon Coat of arms from Peter II of Aragon to Peter IV of Aragon Coat of arms from Peter IV of Aragon to Ferdinand II of Aragon"], "selected_questions": ["What territories did the Crown of Aragon control during its height in the 14th and 15th centuries?", "How were the component realms of the Crown of Aragon governed politically?", "What led to the abolition of the Crown of Aragon by King Philip V in 1716?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["During its height in the 14th and 15th centuries, the Crown of Aragon controlled a large portion of present-day eastern Spain, parts of what is now southern France, and a Mediterranean empire which included the Balearic Islands, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, Southern Italy (from 1442), and parts of Greece (until 1388).", "The component realms of the Crown of Aragon were not united politically except at the level of the king.

{"name": "Acqua Felice", "documents": ["# Acqua Felice\nThe Acqua Felice is one of the aqueducts of Rome, completed in 1586 by Pope Sixtus V, whose birth name, which he never fully abandoned, was Felice Peretti. The first new aqueduct of early modern Rome, its source is at the springs at Pantano Borghese, off Via Casilina. Its length is fifteen miles (24 km), running underground for eight miles (13 km) from its source, first in the channel of Aqua Alexandrina, then alternating on the arches of the Aqua Claudia and the Aqua Marcia for seven miles (11 km) to its terminus at the Fontana dell'Acqua Felice on the Quirinal Hill, standing to one side of the Strada Pia (now Via del Quirinale), so as to form a piazza in this still new part of Rome. The engineer was Giovanni Fontana, brother of Sixtus' engineer-architect Domenico Fontana, who recorded that the very day the new pope entered the Lateran, he decided that he would bring water once again to the hills of Rome, which had remained waterless and sparsely inhabited, largely by monasteries, since the Roman aqueducts had been destroyed in the sixth century. From the source, which Sixtus purchased, there was only a very small fall, and the work required an underground conduit as well as an aqueduct carried on arches.\n## Construction\nThe work was completed within eighteen months, at the same time that Sixtus was engaged in laying out the street plan that would provide the arteries of modern Rome. By October 1586, water was running at his Villa Montalto, and by 1589 it was filling no less than twenty-seven public fountains.\n## Cultural significance\nThe three-arched Fontana dell'Acqua Felice (designed by Domenico Fontana, 1587) marked the entry of the new water source into Rome, with the conventional mostra or showy terminus: \"what makes a fountain a mostra is not essentially its size or splendor, but its specific designation as the fountain that is a public memorial to the whole achievement of the aqueduct.\" \"Even in the seventeenth century this fountain was considered as being in very bad style (pessimo stile),\" Siegfried Giedion reported \"and it is scarcely conceivable that such mediocrity was possible only two decades after the death of Michelangelo\". Its disproportionately large attic, a billboard for the triumphant inscription, has an unbalanced stagey flatness; its proportions may be unfavorably compared to the Arco Scalette, Vicenza, erected in 1576, probably designed by Andrea Palladio (illustration, right).\nThe allegories are resolutely biblical, avoiding classical pagan allusions in publicising the modern pope who demolished the Septizodium to make way for his avenues linking the major Christian monuments of Rome, the pilgrimage basilicas. Any mostra had its practical aspect in providing public water supply for its rione (the city's administrative areas). The marble basins, flanked by Egyptian lions that spit water, served as reservoirs for local inhabitants; marble barriers keep animals from polluting the water: for them there is a special basin nearby. Next to the fountain Sixtus installed two long basins for washing laundry, and a covered washhouse where women might enjoy privacy."], "selected_questions": ["When was the Acqua Felice aqueduct completed in Rome?", "Where is the source of the Acqua Felice aqueduct located?", "How long did it take to complete the construction of the Acqua Felice aqueduct?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The Acqua Felice aqueduct was completed in Rome in 1586.", "The source of the Acqua Felice aqueduct is located at the springs at Pantano Borghese, off Via Casilina.", "The construction of the Acqua Felice aqueduct was completed within eighteen months."], "InternLM_answers": ["The Acqua Felice aqueduct was completed in 1587.", "The source of the Acqua Felice aqueduct is located in the Sabine Mountains, approximately 50 kilometers northeast of Rome.", "The Acqua Felice aqueduct was completed in 1586, after 27 years of construction."], "human_GPT3.5_answers_D_ann": [["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> The Acqua Felice is one of the aqueducts of Rome, completed in 1586 by Pope Sixtus V"], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> Its source is at the springs at Pantano Borghese, off Via Casilina 参考0：off Via Casilina."], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> The work was completed within eighteen months"]], "human_InternLM_answers_ann": [["<Hallucination> Contradictory\n<Reference> Acqua Felice is one of the aqueducts of Rome, completed in 1586 by Pope Sixtus V\n<Correction>  \"1587\" to \"1586\"."], ["<Hallucination> Contradictory\n<Reference> Its source is at the springs at Pantano Borghese, off Via Casilina\n<Correction>  \"in the Sabine Mountains, approximately 50 kilometers northeast of Rome.\" to \"at the springs at Pantano Borghese, off Via Casilina\""], ["<Hallucination> Contradictory\n<Reference> The work was completed within eighteen months\n<Correction>  \" 27 years\" to \"eighteen months\""]], "language": "en"}
{"name": "RAF Spilsby", "documents": ["# RAF Spilsby\nRoyal Air Force Spilsby or more simply RAF Spilsby is a former Royal Air Force station during the Second World War and the Cold War located in the rural village of Great Steeping, near the market town of Spilsby, Lincolnshire, England.\n## History\n### A change of location\nDuring the Second World War the Air Ministry attempted to build an airfield at Gunby Hall that would have covered most of the estate and necessitated the demolition of the magnificent and historic hall. The then owner, Field Marshal Sir Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd personally appealed to King George VI and the Air Ministry relented, redrawing the plans that resulted in the building of the resited RAF Spilsby although the runway would eventually end only a few yards short of the Gunby estate boundary hedge.\n### First action\nThe airfield was built at Great Steeping, just 2 mi (3.2 km) south west of its originally planned location at Gunby, during 1942 to 1943 and opened for action on 20 September 1943 as an overflow satellite airfield to RAF East Kirkby in 5 (Bomber) Group RAF. The first operational squadron to be based at Spilsby was No 207 squadron RAF who moved from RAF Langar on 12 October 1943. The squadron bombed Hanover in Germany six days later on 18 October and the following week the station was upgraded from satellite status to a full station in its own right.\n### Later in the war\nIn April 1944 the three local bomber stations at Spilsby, Strubby and East Kirkby combined to form the 55 Base RAF with the headquarters located at East Kirkby. RAF Spilsby became a two squadron station when No. 44 Squadron RAF relocated from RAF Dunholme Lodge near Lincoln in October 1944.\nIn 1944 a Spilsby-based 207 Squadron airman, Flying Officer Denys Street escaped from the German prisoner of war camp Stalag Luft III and was one of the fifty executed by the Gestapo in the aftermath of the mass escape that was later filmed as The Great Escape.\nDuring the war the Lancasters of 207 Squadron flew over 6,000 individual sorties during 540 operational missions, by both day and night with the loss of 154 seven man crews killed or missing, with at least another 9 aircraft lost on non-operational training or ferry flights.\nAs the Second World War came to an end 44 Squadron was moved south to RAF Mepal in Cambridgeshire and they were replaced by No. 75 (New Zealand) Squadron who were planned to be part of the Tiger Force against Japan. However, when the nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the war ended, the Spilsby squadrons were moved elsewhere in October 1945. The airfield defence force of No. 2751 Squadron RAF Regiment remained at RAF Spilsby and it became No. 2 Armament and Gunnery Practice School.\n### Airfield accidents\nOn Easter Monday 10 April 1944, during the preparation for an operation, a 1,000 lb (450 kg) bomb exploded while it was being disarmed in a fusing shed. Ten squadron armourers were killed, three of whom were never found and have no known grave. The force of the explosion also caused damage to some of the airfield's buildings and even some slight damage in the nearby community.\nThe second accident happened on 1 November 1944. During 207 Squadron's daylight departure on sorties, a Lancaster piloted by Flying Officer Arthur Loveless swung violently on take-off and careered across the airfield. It demolished a Nissen hut before coming to rest among four Halifaxes belonging to 429 'Bison' Squadron (RCAF) which had been diverted to Spilsby from the previous night's operation. The Lancaster and three of the Halifaxes were destroyed by explosion and fire. A fourth Halifax was severely damaged and its Flight Engineer killed when he started the engines with the intention of getting clear of the inferno. Once again a number of the airfield's buildings were damaged with the control tower having a narrow escape.\nA few days later on 11 November, a further tragedy befell Spilsby airmen when returning home from an operation. Two Lancasters – one from 44 Squadron, flown by Pilot Officer Garyer, and one from 207 Squadron – received identical landing instructions from the Spilsby control tower and collided in the approach funnel over the village of Bratoft, east of the airfield, killing both crews and scattering debris over a large area. This led to revised approach procedures being implemented with aircraft being allocated specific time slots to prevent overcrowding in the circuit.\n### The Cold War period and closure\nIn December 1946 RAF Spilsby was abandoned and placed on care and maintenance until June 1955, during which time it was used for storing overflow supplies for RAF East Kirkby. After the Korean War and as the Cold War started RAF Spilsby re-opened to host units of the USAF and the east-west runway was extended by 1,590 ft (480 m) in preparation for accommodating long range escort fighters. However no USAF squadrons were ever based at Spilsby, where only non-flying units were stationed, there is no evidence that the airfield was used by any aircraft. The Korean war had ended in 1953 but the USAF did not move out until March 1958, relocating to RAF Mildenhall, when the Spilsby airfield immediately closed. The extended runway was long enough to handle the RAF's jet engined nuclear bomber V-force and a decision to rip it out was delayed for nearly twenty years just in case it became needed again by the RAF.\nSpilsby remained on RAF maps as a designated emergency landing site for the Avro Vulcan bombers based at RAF Scampton. With the V-force disbanding the runways and perimeter track were finally torn up during the late 1970s, with most of the crushed aggregate being used in the construction of the new Humber Bridge.\n## Memorials\nRAF Spilsby is commemorated by an Airfield Memorial standing just outside Great Steeping and by plaques in the All Saints' Church Great Steeping. The ghost cropmarks showing the airfield's runway layout are still visible on some aerial photographs and at certain times of the year.\n## Units and aircraft based at Spilsby"], "selected_questions": ["Where was RAF Spilsby located during the Second World War and the Cold War?", "When did RAF Spilsby become operational?", "Which squadron was the first to be based at RAF Spilsby?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["RAF Spilsby was located in the rural village of Great Steeping, near the market town of Spilsby, Lincolnshire, England.", "RAF Spilsby became operational on September 20, 1943.", "The first squadron to be based at RAF Spilsby was No. 207 squadron RAF."], "InternLM_answers": ["RAF Spilsby was located in Lincolnshire, England during the Second World War and the Cold War.", "RAF Spilsby became operational on 21 December 1943.", "The first squadron to be based at RAF Spilsby was No. 266 Squadron."], "human_GPT3.5_answers_D_ann": [["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> Royal Air Force Spilsby or more simply RAF Spilsby is a former Royal Air Force station during the Second World War and the Cold War located in the rural village of Great Steeping, near the market town of Spilsby, Lincolnshire, England"], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> The airfield [...] opened for action on 20 September 1943 [...]"], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> The first operational squadron to be based at Spilsby was No 207 squadron RAF who moved from RAF Langar on 12 October 1943"]], "human_InternLM_answers_ann": [["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> Royal Air Force Spilsby or more simply RAF Spilsby is a former Royal Air Force station during the Second World War and the Cold War located in the rural village of Great Steeping, near the market town of Spilsby, Lincolnshire, England"], ["<Hallucination> Contradictory\n<Reference> The airfield was built at Great Steeping, just 2 mi (3.2 km) south west of its originally planned location at Gunby, during 1942 to 1943 and opened for action on 20 September 1943 as an overflow satellite airfield to RAF East Kirkby\n<Correction>  \"21 December 1943\" to \"20 September 1943\"."], ["<Hallucination> Contradictory\n<Reference> The first operational squadron to be based at Spilsby was No 207 squadron RAF who moved from RAF Langar on 12 October 1943\n<Correction>  \"266 Squadron\" to \"44 Squadron RAF\"."]], "language": "en"}
{"name": "San Cristóbal de las Casas", "documents": ["# San Cristóbal de las Casas\nSan Cristóbal de las Casas (Spanish:  (listen)), also known by its native Tzotzil name, Jovel (pronounced ), is a town and municipality located in the Central Highlands region of the Mexican state of Chiapas. It was the capital of the state until 1892, and is still considered the cultural capital of Chiapas.\nThe municipality is mostly made up of mountainous terrain, but the city sits in a small valley surrounded by hills. The city’s center maintains its Spanish colonial layout and much of its architecture, with red tile roofs, cobblestone streets and wrought iron balconies often with flowers. Most of the city’s economy is based on commerce, services and tourism.\nTourism is based on the city’s history, culture and indigenous population, although the tourism itself has affected the city, giving it foreign elements. Major landmarks of the city include the Cathedral, the Santo Domingo church with its large open air crafts market and the Casa Na Bolom museum. The municipality has suffered severe deforestation, but it has natural attractions such as caves and rivers.\n## The town and municipality\nSan Cristóbal de las Casas is a city and municipality located in the Central Highlands region of Chiapas. As a municipality, the city functions as the governmental authority for 83 other rural communities outside the city proper, which cover a territory of 484 km2. Of these communities, the most important include La Candelaria, San Antonio del Monte, Mitziton, San José Yashitinin, El Pinar, Buenavista, Pedernal, Corazon de Maria and Zacualpa Ecatepec. The municipality borders the municipalities of Chamula, Tenejapa, Huixtán, Teopisca, Totolapa, Chiapilla, San Lucas and Zinacantán.\nThe city, especially the historic center, has maintained its Spanish colonial layout, with narrow cobblestone streets, roofs covered in red clay tile and wrought iron balconies with flowers. The facades of the buildings vary from Baroque to Neoclassical and Moorish, painted in various colors. Milk delivery from local dairy farms still use canisters on donkeys, and farmers typically still use horses and donkeys for hauling wood and farmed goods within their own properties . The city subdivides into three sections but the majority of the population lives in the central section near the city center. Many of the surrounding hills have lost their native trees, in part due to cutting firewood and logging operations which feed the local manufacturing and construction industries.\nAlthough the political capital of Chiapas was moved to Tuxtla at the end of the 19th century, San Cristóbal is considered to be the “cultural capital” of the state. Designated a “Pueblo Mágico” (Magical Village) in 2003, it was further recognized as “The most magical of the Pueblos Mágicos” by President Felipe Calderón in 2010. Much of this culture is associated with the city’s and municipality’s large indigenous population, which is mostly made up of Tzotzils and Tzeltals. One aspect of traditional culture associated with these indigenous groups is the making of textiles, especially weaving, with amber another important product. Ceramics, wrought iron and filigree jewelry can be found as well. The best known area for crafts is the tianguis at Santo Domingo. The city hosts an annual Amber Expo at the Centro de Convenciones Casa de Mazariegos. The event exhibits and sells amber and amber pieces from the area of the state. A more traditional Mexican market is located just north of the Santo Tomas Church. It is open each day except Sunday, when its vendors go to the surrounding communities in the municipality to sell at their markets. On the days that it is open, the large building, which mostly houses traditional butcher shops, is surrounded by stalls which crowd the nearby streets. There are very few tourists here, except for the occasional backpacker. Markets like this serve traditional dishes such as saffron tamales, sopa de pan, asado coleto, atole de granillo and a drink called posh made from sugar cane.\nThe city’s attraction for tourists has also led to a number making San Cristobal their permanent home, which has had an effect of the local culture, especially in the historic center. Many foreign residents have opened up restaurants with Italian, French, Thai, Indian, Chinese and more options, such as vegetarian. An older foreign influence is the city’s noted cured meat tradition, which can be traced back to both the Spanish and the Germans. These are featured in a number of dishes including chalupas. Foreign influence can also be seen in the city’s nightlife which offers reggae, salsa, techno and more.\nFireworks are common as there are many religious festivals which use them. Important celebrations include those dedicated to the Dulce Niño de Jesús, the Señor de Esquipulas, Saint Anthony, Corpus Christi, San Cristóbal and the Holy Family. This is in addition to the various neighborhood saint celebrations in their respective churches around town. However, the most elaborate rituals are performed during Holy Week. Holy Week processions include both silent and chanting marchers. A number are dressed in pointed hoods and carry heavy platforms with religious figures. They go from house to house, stopping at those homes that have erected small shrines. There they say prayers and bless the house and its occupants before moving on. They finally come to rest in a gigantic open house where an inner shrine has been erected lit by thousands of candles, and where a large potluck supper takes place. All, even passersby, are welcome to partake. Passion plays depicting the crucifixion of Jesus are common events with one large one centered in the open plaza behind the municipal palace. After dark, there is the Burning of Judas. The figures burned are plentiful and include, as well as Judas, government bureaucrats, church officials, army officers, US political figures, Spanish conquistadors, and popular celebrities. They are lit by local firemen who try to keep people back at a safe distance, but fireworks occasionally fall among the crowds anyway.\nThe Feria de la Primavera y la Paz (Spring and Peace Fair) runs concurrent with Holy Week, especially on Holy Saturday with music and costumes. It terminates with the burning of Judas. A queen is elected to be crowned the next day. Bullfights are held.\nThe Festival Cervantino Barroco is held each year in the historic center featuring invited artists from various parts of Mexico and abroad. It is held in various forums in the city and includes concerts, plays, exhibitions and conferences.\nThe center of the city is its main plaza. This plaza’s official name is Plaza 31 de marzo, but it is more often simply called the Zócalo. In the colonial era, the city’s main market was here as well as the main water supply. Today, it is centered on a kiosk which was added in the early 20th century. The corners of this structure have inscriptions marking the major events of San Cristóbal’s history. The rest of the plaza is filled with gardens and surrounded by the most important buildings and finest homes from the history of the city. Surrounding this plaza are the city’s most important buildings such as the Cathedral and the city hall.\nThe Cathedral is to the north of the main plaza and it is the most emblematic symbol of the city. However, the main facade does not face the Zócalo, rather it faces its own atrium which is called the Cathedral Plaza. The Cathedral began as a modest church dedicated to the Virgin of the Assumption built in 1528. When Chiapas became a diocese in the 17th century, with San Cristóbal as its seat, this church was torn down to build the current structure, dedicated to Saint Christopher, the patron of the city. The overall structure contains European Baroque, Moorish and indigenous influences. The main facade was finished in 1721 and some final touches were added in the 20th century. The main feature of the church is its main facade, which was finished in 1721. It is Baroque painted yellow with ornamental columns and niches in which are various saints. It is divided into three horizontal and three vertical levels marked off by pairs of Solomonic columns and meant to resemble an altarpiece. It is further decorated with intricate raised stucco work mostly in white which show Oaxacan and Guatemalan influences. The layout of the interior shows Moorish influence. The main altar is dedicated to both the Virgin of the Assumption and Saint Christopher. The wood pulpit is from the 16th century and gilded. The side walls have two Baroque altarpieces, one to the Virgin of the Assumption and the other to John of Nepomuk. There is also a small chapel dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe on the north side. The sacristy has a large colonial era paintings of Jesus in Gethsemane by Juan Correa as well as paintings by Miguel Cabrera and Eusebio de Aguilar. It is common to see older indigenous women in the Cathedral, with some even traversing the entire nave on their knees to approach the large image of Jesus handing above the Baroque altar.\nAt the back of the Cathedral, there is an affixed church called the San Nicolás Temple. It was constructed between 1613 and 1621 in Moorish design by Augustinian monks for use by the indigenous population. It is the only church in the city which has not been significantly altered since its construction. The roof is pitched and pyramid shaped built with wood and tile, and its facade is made of stone and brick with little ornamentation. Two of its images, the Señor de la Misericordia and the Virgen de los Dolores are both from Guatemala.\nThe city hall, often called the Palacio de Gobierno, is a Neoclassical construction which was built in the 19th century by architect Carlos Z. Flores. It contains a series of arches supported by Tuscan columns. In front of the city hall at night, young men and women promenade past each other in opposite directions around the gazebo. The city hall is scene to fairly frequent protests, some directly associated with the Zapatistas and others are held by student activists from UNAM in Mexico City. These protests are generally accompanied by lines of riot police.\nWhen Dominicans came to San Cristóbal from Seville, Spain, they were given an area of land to construct their church and monastery. The first stone was laid in 1547 by Francisco Marroqui, then Bishop of Guatemala. The monastery was finished in 1551. It is one of the most ornate structures in Latin America, both due to the stucco work on the main facade and the gilded altarpieces which completely cover the length on the church’s interior. The facade of the main church is Baroque with Salomonic columns heavily decorated in stucco forms to mimic an altarpiece. The interior has a pulpit carved of wood and covered in gold leaf. The walls are covered in Baroque altarpieces includes those dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The La Caridad Temple was constructed on the site in 1712, established as part of the first hospital for the indigenous. The main facade of this church is designed as an altarpiece with two levels, a central bell tower and Tuscan columns and pilasters. Its design is derived from the Baroque that developed in Lima, Peru. There is an image of the Virgen de la Caridad (Virgin of Charity) carrying a baton like a military general. There is also a notable sculpture of Saint James on horseback. The complex contains two museums. The Museo de la Historia de la Ciudad covers the history of the city until the 19th century. Of this collection, the two most important pieces are some petals of a pomegranate flower, from a receptacle for the Host in the Cathedral. It is one of the most important works of Chiapas silversmithing. The rest of the piece has been lost. The other is a part of the original choir seating of the same Cathedral. The Centro Cultural de los Altos has a collection of some of the area’s textiles from each ethnicity and exhibits on how they are made. It has a store associated with it called the Sna-Jolobil, which means house of weaving in Tzotzil\nCasa Na Bolom (House of the Jaguar) is a museum, hotel and restaurant located outside the city’s historic center. The structure was built as part of a seminary in 1891, but it became the home of Frans Blom and Gertrude Duby Blom in the 20th century. Franz was an explorer and archeologist and Gertrude was a journalist and photographer. The couple spent over fifty years in Chiapas collecting tools, crafts, archeological pieces and clothing, especially related to the Lacandon Jungle and people. The museum is dedicated to this collection along with keeping some of the old household rooms intact, such as Franz’s study. It also contains a library with more than 10,000 volumes dedicated to the history, culture and anthropology of the region. There are also magazine and sound libraries as well as the old chapel which contains colonial era religious art. The back of the structure contains a botanical garden.\nThe La Merced monastery was the first in the city founded by the Mercedarians from Guatemala in 1537. It was built as a fortress with barracks for soldiers and space for citizens in case of attack. The church entrance has a massive wooden door with wrought iron hinges and fastenings. There are very few windows and those that exist are built to allow muskets to fire on attackers. The entire structure is built with extensions and abutments to provide for interlocking fields of fire. Entry to the fortifications is denied as too dangerous. The church still functions as such. It consists of a single nave, with interior remodeled in Neoclassical design during the Porfirio Díaz era. The oldest part of the structure is an arch and columns located in the interior of the sacristy, which is decorated in stucco of various colors with floral and vegetative motifs. At the foot of the column, there are two lions symbolizing Spanish domination. In the latter half of the 19th century, the structure was used as a military barracks and in 1960, it was converted into the city jail which it remained until 1993. In 2000 the former monastery was further converted into the Museum of Amber, which has a collection of over three hundred pieces and is the only one of its kind in the Americas.\nThe Carmen Temple and the Arco Torre, both in Moorish style, are located on Andador Eclesiastico. The Carmen Temple is all that remains of the former La Encarnación convent which was founded in 1597 with the first nuns arriving between 1609 and 1610. The complex includes the old cloister, nuns’ cells and other structures. The original church building burned and it was restored conserving its simple facade. One unusual feature of the church is that its layout is L-shaped, covering the south and west sides of a small plaza. Inside, the walls have carved wood panels and a Neoclassical altar which has been recently restored. In the colonial period, the convent and church served as one of the main entrances into the city. An arch with tower was constructed next to the convent in 1680, now simply called the Arco del Carmen. This arch is in pure Moorish style, with three levels of decoration. It is the only one of its style in Mexico. This arch with its accompanying tower has been adopted as one of the symbols of San Cristóbal.\nThe San Cristóbal Church is atop a long staircase up the hill. It is often closed but it offers panoramic views of the city. At the San Cristóbal church the patron saint is celebrated on 25 July with marimbas, food and fireworks. For ten days previously, each of the main neighborhoods has a pilgrimage to the top of the hill.\nThe San Francisco Church was built by the Franciscans in 1577 as a monastery but only the church survives. The current church was built in the 18th century with a single nave covered in a wood and tile roof. The main facade has three levels and two side towers. Inside, it has six Baroque altarpieces. The upper part of the nave has fourteen oil paintings. The atrium has a sculpted stone baptismal font.\nThe Guadalupe Church is located on the Cerro de Guadalupe. It was constructed in 1834. To reach it, there are seventy nine stairs up the hill. The church has a single nave with a side chapel. The main altar has an oil painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe and the side chapel contains a sculpture of the Virgin from 1850. The atrium affords panoramic views of the city. The feast of this Virgin is celebrated annually with a parade on the main street with fireworks, rockets and candlelight vigils.\nThe Santo Tomas Church is just north of the historic center. It has a museum in the back, in a building which was the barracks and parade grounds built when the city was founded.\nThe Santa Lucía Church was constructed in 1884 by architect Carlos Z. Flores over what was a dilapidated chapel. It consists of a single nave with pilasters on its walls and pointed arches. The main altar is Gothic with Neoclassical and Art Nouveau elements.\nThe Museo Mesoamericano del Jade has jade pieces from the Olmec, Teotihuacan, Mixtec, Zapotec, Maya, Toltec and Aztec cultures. There is also a life-sized replica of the burial chamber of Pakal of Palenque as it looked when the king was buried. The Maya Medicine Museum is dedicated to the various techniques and practices of indigenous medicine, many of which are still practiced today. The Museo de las Culturas Populares de Chiapas (Museum of Popular Cultures of Chiapas) is located on Diego de Mazariego Street. It is mostly dedicated to the indigenous cultures of the state with the aim of recuperating, valuing and promoting knowledge of these cultures in Chiapas and beyond. The museum has exhibits of many of these cultures and also sponsors live events related to its mission as well.\nCasa de las Sirenas is one of the most notable domestic structures from the colonial era. It was built by Andrés de la Tovilla in Plateresque style and dates from the 16th century. It is named after a mermaid that appears on its crest in one of the corners. The Antiguo Colegio de San Francisco Javier today houses the Faculty of Law of the state university. It was founded by the Jesuits in 1681 for the education of the Spanish elite. Its current facade is two levels in Neoclassical style. The interior contains murals about the Spanish conquest of Mexico.\n## Climate\nSan Cristóbal de las Casas has a mild subtropical highland climate (Köppen Cwb) moderated by its altitude. The dry season, which runs from November to April is cool with a January average of 12.3 °C (54.1 °F). Owing to its altitude and the relative aridity of the dry season, San Cristóbal de las Casas has a fairly high diurnal temperature range and nighttime temperatures are cool. Extended periods of frosts are rare, occurring only 2 or 3 days per year in December to February. Humidity is high (around 78 percent), even during the winter months, but fog or mist is quite common during the dry months, occurring on 13 to 17 days. Usually, this clears off during the day. The wet season, which runs from May to October is warmer, with a June average of 17.0 °C (62.6 °F) and precipitation is much higher during these months. Fog is less common during this time. Average annual precipitation is 1,084.7 millimetres (42.7 in) most of it concentrated in the wet season. The wettest month recorded was September 1998 when 525.8 millimetres (20.70 in) of precipitation was recorded, and the wettest day recorded was on October 4, 2005 with 105 millimetres (4.13 in). Extremes range from a low of −8.5 °C (16.7 °F) to 35.8 °C (96.4 °F).\n## History\nThe city was founded as Villa Real de Chiapa in 1528 by Diego de Mazariegos in what was called the Hueyzacatlán Valley, which means “pasture” in Nahuatl. From then on, the city went through a number of name changes: to Villa Viciosa in 1529, to Villa de San Cristóbal de los Llanos in 1531, and to Ciudad Real in 1536. It was changed to Ciudad de San Cristóbal in 1829. “de las Casas” was added in 1848 in honor of Bartolomé de las Casas. There were some modifications in the early 20th century to the name but it returned to San Cristóbal de las Casas in 1943. In the Tzotzil and Tzeltal languages the name of the area is Jovel, “the place in the clouds”.\nThe area did not have a pre-Hispanic city. After defeating the Zoques in the Northern Mountains and the Chiapans of this area, Diego de Mazariegos founded the city as a military fort. This city and much of what would be the state of Chiapas came under the Captaincy General of Guatemala in 1532 headed by Pedro de Alvarado. San Cristóbal received its coat of arms in 1535 from Carlos V and it was officially declared a city in 1536. The city gained the rank of Alcadía Mayor in 1577 which gave it authority over much of Chiapas north of it. The intendencia of Chiapas was created in 1786 combining San Cristóbal’s territory with that of Tuxtla and Soconusco, with the government in San Cristóbal. In 1821, the city followed the Comitán de Domínguez’ declaration of independence from Spain and the Captaincy General of Guatemala. However, the city and the rest of Chiapas became a part of Mexico in 1824, with the capital established here.\nIn 1829, the name Ciudad Real was changed to San Cristóbal. In the 19th century, the state government would shift back and forth between San Cristóbal, in the highlands dominated by Conservatives, and Tuxtla, dominated by Liberals. Independent tendencies arose again in 1853, when the Plan of Yalmús was announced declaring the then Mexican Constitution null. Conservative forces attacked the city in 1857 but were dislodged shortly thereafter by Liberal Angel Albino Corzo. The last of French forces were expelled from the city in 1864. The state government was moved from San Cristóbal to Tuxtla for good in 1892 by the Liberal government. There was a failed attempt in 1911 by Conservatives in San Cristóbal and neighboring San Juan Chamula to force the return of the capital.\nIn 1915, the state went to the municipality system with San Cristóbal becoming a municipality. Originally, it had jurisdiction over communities such as San Lucas, Zinacantán, San Felipe Ecatepec, Tenejapa, San Miguel Mitontic, Huixtan and Chanal, but these would later separate to become municipalities in their own right. In the 20th century, the outskirts of the city become filled with open pit mines for gravel and sand. There was even one opened on a hill in the San Diego and La Florecilla neighborhoods, near the historic center called Salsipuedes. These prompted environmental and local community organizations to protest, stating that the valley is a closed water basin and the mining negatively affects potable water supplies. Salsipuedes was closed in the 2000s.\nThe city was declared a national historic monument in 1974.\nSan Cristóbal became the center of political activism with the election of Samuel Ruiz as bishop of Chiapas in 1960. In the 1960s and 1970s, the traditional Catholic Church was losing indigenous adherents to Protestant and other Christian groups. To counter this, Ruiz supported and worked with Marist priests and nuns following an ideology called liberation theology. In 1974 he organized a statewide Indian Congress with representatives from 327 communities of the Tzeltal, Tzotzil, Tojolabal and Ch'ol peoples as well as Marists and the Maoist People’s Union. This congress was the first of its kind with the goal of uniting the indigenous peoples politically. These efforts were also supported by leftist organizations from outside Mexico, especially to form unions of ejido organizations. These unions would later form the base of the EZLN organization. These efforts would also create a “new” type of Catholic in the state called “Word of God” Catholic. These would shun the “traditionalist” Catholic practice mixed with indigenous rites and beliefs. It would also create a split in many communities as the “Word of God” Catholics were loyal directly to the bishop in San Cristóbal, with traditionalists loyal to local cacique leaders.\nActivism and resentment continued from the 1970s to the 1990s. During this decade, the Mexican federal government adopted neoliberalism, which clashed with the leftist political ideas of liberation theology and many of the indigenous activist groups. Despite the activism, economic marginalization among indigenous groups remained high, with resentment strongest in the San Cristóbal region and in migrant communities living in the Lacandon Jungle.\nThe grievances of these activists would be taken up by a small guerrilla band led by a man called only “Subcomandante Marcos.” His small band, called the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional, EZLN), came to the world’s attention when on January 1, 1994, the day the NAFTA treaty went into effect. On this day, EZLN forces occupied and took over the towns of San Cristóbal de las Casas, along with six other Chiapas communities. They read their proclamation of revolt to the world and then laid siege to a nearby military base, capturing weapons and releasing many prisoners from the jails. Ruiz negotiated between the EZLN and authorities even though his leftist activism made him suspect to many authorities. This would undermine efforts and eventually the Catholic Church would split from the Zapatista movement. However, the negotiations would lead to the San Andrés Accords and ended the rebellion peacefully. By the time he died in 2011, Ruiz was locally given the name of “Tatic”, which means “father” in Tzotzil, and received numerous distinctions including the Simón Bolívar Prize from UNESCO and the International Human Rights Award in Nuremberg.\n## Environment\nThe city and municipality are located in a region called the Chiapas Highlands or Central Highlands. Two thirds of the municipality is made up of mountainous terrain with the rest valley floor. The city proper is located at 2,200 meters above sea level in a small valley surrounded by hills. The most important of these hills include Cerro Huitepec, San José Bocomtenelté, Cerro San Felipe, Cerro El Extranjero, Cerro Cruz Carreta, El Arcotete and Cerro Tzontehuitz. While it is in a tropical zone, its climate is temperate due to the altitude. The climate is also humid, with cloud cover in the winter months that keeps temperatures down and can produce cold nights. Average temperature between December and April is 18 °C. The area receives most of its rain in the summer to early fall. However, the cloud cover that exists in winter is generally absent and daytime temperatures can go up to 35 °C with high humidity.\nDue to its high altitude the city temperatures can reach temperatures below 0 °C. Many homes burn firewood for warmth in cold weather. This can give the city a slightly smoky smell although the number of homes burning firewood for warmth has dropped in the last two decades as more homes are integrating climate-control systems under city recommendations.\nThe natural vegetation of the area is pine–oak forest. However, most of the surrounding hills have lost their native trees, with deforestation rates at 80%, losing 15,000 hectares just since 1980. Reasons for this include cutting for firewood, urban development, poor resource management, fires and agriculture. The deforestation has led to erosion problems blocking rivers and streams and affecting underground recharge of the area's freshwater springs. It has also negatively affected endangered species such as the golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia), which winters here.\nThe main rivers are the Amarillo and Fogótico along with a number of streams such as the Chamula, Peje de Oro and Ojo de Agua. There are also two lakes called the Chapultepec and Cochi. The city had twenty-five natural fresh water springs, but deforestation has dried up seven and twelve flow only during the rainy season, leaving six for the city year round. These and the remaining surface lakes were declared protected in 2008.\nThe municipality has a number of ecological features. The Gruta de San Cristóbal is one of a number of caves in the mountains around the city just off Federal Highway 190 heading towards Comitán. This particular cave was discovered by Vicente Kramsky in 1947. The cave has only one entrance with lateral chambers. It has a total length of 10.2 km and a depth of 550 meters. The Rancho Nuevo cave has a path which extends 750 meters into the interior and is lit in various colors. Around the caves, there are campsites and horseback riding.\nThe municipality contains two ecological reserves called the Cerro Huitepec Private Reserve and the Rancho Nuevo Ecological Conservation Zone. Another protected area is the El Arcotete Forest located 15 km northeast of the city. It contains a natural bridge which was part of an ancient cave that was worn away.\nThe Humedales de Montaña La Kisst is an urban wetland located southwest of the historic center. Springs in the area are an important source of water for the city, and the wetland helps capture, store, and filter clean water as well as provide habitat to aquatic life. In 2008 a 110-hectare area around the wetlands was designated an ecological conservation area, and 35 hectares were designated a wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention in the same year. The wetland remains under threat from over-pumping of groundwater and encroachment by urban development. Humedales de Montaña María Eugenia is a wetland in the southeastern portion of the city. It supports populations of fish, amphibians, and resident and migratory birds, and helps reduce flood risk and recharge drinking water aquifers for the city. The wetlands was designated a 115-hectare ecological conservation area in 2008, and it was designated a Ramsar Site in 2012. Gertrude Duby Biotic Reserve is a 64-hectare reserve in the mountains immediately east of the city. It was designated in 1994 and named for Gertrude Duby Blom, a journalist, anthropologist, environmentalist, and San Cristóbal resident.\n## Infrastructure\nSan Cristóbal de las Casas is located 80 km from Tuxtla Gutiérrez on Highway 190. It had an airport named Corazón de María 18 km outside the city proper, until the airport was closed in 2010. The municipality has 193.17 km of highway, most of which is state highway connecting the city to Tuxtla Gutierrez and to points north such as Ocosingo and Palenque. There are also a number of rural roads (44.9 km) as well as roads maintained by the Secretarías de Obras Públicas, Desarrollo Rural, Defensa Nacional, and Comisión Nacional del Agua.\nAs of 2005, there were 32,654 residences in the municipality. About 80% of all residences are owned by their occupants. There is an average occupancy of 4.84 people per home, which is about the state average. Twenty-six percent of homes have dirt floors with about 60% having cement. Twenty-five percent of homes have wood sides and 65% have those made of block. About 35% have roofs of asbestos or metal with about 11% having tile roofs. Over 96% have electricity, over 82% have running water and just under 80% have sewerage.\n## Demographics\nIn 2010 the municipality of San Cristóbal de las Casas had a total population of 185,917, and the city of 158,027. Other than the city of San Cristóbal de las Casas, the municipality had 110 localities, the largest of which (with 2010 populations in parentheses) were: San Antonio del Monte (2,196), La Candelaria (1,955), Mitzitón (1,293), and San José Yashitinín (1,109), all classified as rural.\nAs of 2010, 59,943 people in the municipality spoke an indigenous language. The two most important ethnic groups in the area are the Tzotzil and Tzetzal.\nAbout 85% of the municipal population lives in the city proper with the rest in rural communities. The population density is 274/km2, well above the regional average of 190/km2 and state average of 52/km2. Most of the population is young, with about 68% under the age of thirty and an average age of twenty. Population growth is about 4.10%, above the regional and state averages of 2.37 and 2.06% respectively. The population is expected to double within twenty years.\nIn 2000 the municipality had an illiteracy rate of just under 18%, down from just under 25% in 1990. Of these over 15, just over 16% have not finished primary school, about 17% have only primary school completed and about 48% have finished some level above that. Just under 78% of the population is Catholic with about 15% belonging to Protestant, Evangelical or other Christian sects.\n## Economy and tourism\nSan Cristóbal has the second-lowest rate of economic marginalization in the state of Chiapas following Tuxtla Gutiérrez. Only 4.5% of workers do not receive a salary or a regular income. Approximately 9% are employed in agriculture, compared to 54.86% regionally and 47.25% in the state. 21% are employed in construction, energy and transportation. The most important sector by economic output is mining. About 600 truckloads of jade, gravel, stone and metals are exported from San Cristóbal daily. Most of the material is destined to other municipalities in the region, although some goes to other cities in Chiapas and to states such as Tabasco and Campeche. This heavy strip mining has gradually eaten away at the natural landscape of some areas and has negatively affected the recharge of surface and subsurface water.\nThe most important economic sector is commerce, services and tourism, which employs almost 67% of the workforce compared to 29% for the region and 37% for the state. The city has become a renowned tourist location for its preserved colonial architecture and retention of indigenous culture and traditions. Many residents of the city wear indigenous clothing regularly. Market vendors in the city are known for being very aggressive when trying to secure a sale.\nThe municipality contains over 80 hotels with more than 2,000 rooms. The city government serves tourists through traditional information booths with guided tours and also offers “I-Pod tours” where tourists may rent an iPod which uses a GPS system to identify where any given tourist is and provide them with information regarding their surroundings. These tours allow visitors to roam the city and listen/read about the areas in which they are located.\nSince the Zapatista uprising in 1994, the city has developed a type of cult tourism focusing around the EZLN. This tourism attracts those interested in both leftist political beliefs and indigenous activism who come to see where the events of the 1990s happened as well as what is going on now. This tourism has spurred the creation of Zapatista-themed shops which sell EZLN shirts and other souvenirs. This tourism has been given the name of “Zapaturismo” or “Zapatourism”. The term originally was derogatory and referred to the large number of leftist activists which converged on the city after the EZLN uprising began. Since then, the term receives mixed reviews with some finding humor in it.\nThe most important manufactured goods produced in the city are jade, textiles and amber, although others such as ceramics, metal works, carved wood products, clothing and filigree jewelry can be found as well. There is a large tianguis or open air market at Santo Domingo which specializes in selling these locally produced products.\nThere has been a recent problem with fake amber being sold on the street, either made of plastic or glass. True Chiapas amber is extracted from the town of Simojovel to the north. There is a great price difference between the real and fake amber, and this price difference can be enough to put authentic amber vendors out of business. Many of the sellers of fake amber are successful because many people, especially foreign tourists, do not know how to determine what is real. However, one indicator is price, as true amber cannot be sold for the very low prices that street vendors offer."], "selected_questions": ["What is the main economic sector in San Cristóbal de las Casas?", "How is the climate of San Cristóbal de las Casas described?", "What is the name of the main plaza in San Cristóbal de las Casas?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The main economic sector in San Cristóbal de las Casas is commerce, services, and tourism.", "The climate of San Cristóbal de las Casas is described as a mild subtropical highland climate.

(607)，又改州为郡，益州改为蜀郡，置太守。\n唐武德元年(618年)，复称为益州，州置刺史。\n贞观元年（627年），李世民废除州、郡制，改益州等州为剑南道。\n垂拱二年(686年)，析益州地置蜀州。\n开元七年（719年）剑南道设剑南节度使，益州属之。\n天宝元年(742年)改州为郡，益州改为蜀郡，益州遂除。\n\n## 成都\n\n成都古称锦城，锦官城，芙蓉城。别称“蓉城”\n成都为古蜀国故地。大约距今2500年前，古蜀国开明王把都城从樊乡（今彭州、新都交界处）迁到此处，取周太王迁岐“一年成聚，二年成邑，三年成都”之意，定名为成都。\n秦灭蜀，改称蜀郡。西汉时成都织锦业发达，朝廷在此设置“锦官”进行管理，因此，成都又被称为“锦官城”或简称“锦城”。五代时，后蜀主孟昶下令遍种芙蓉，成都又被称为“蓉城”。\n从西晋末成汉建立（四世纪初）到唐末五代十国时期，成都的益州别名几乎就不用了。到五代十国的后蜀第二任皇帝孟昶时，由于在城墙外遍种芙蓉树，到花开时节，满城被芙蓉花所包围。从城外看，如同一座芙蓉城，所以蓉城的别谓自此形成。但是成都的本名却从没有变过。\n成都为蜀郡首府，又产蜀锦，皇帝置锦官操办朝廷的蜀锦供求，故又名锦官城。秦末、汉初成都取代中原而称\"天府\"。\n西汉末年，公孙述称帝，定成都为\"成家\"。\n东汉末年，刘焉做\"益州牧\"，移治于成都，用成都作为州、郡、县治地。\n秦汉成都的商业发达，秦时成都即已成为全国大都市，西汉时成都人口达到7.6万户，近40万人，成为全国六大都市（长安、洛阳、邯郸、临淄、宛、成都）之一，\"少城\"为成都商业最发达的城区，那里商品堆积如山，商店、货摊栉比。此外，\"汉代成都的文学艺术也达到很高的水平，司马相如、扬雄、王褒是为时全国最有名的学家，成都出土的汉代画象砖和画象石，绘画精美，内容广泛。\n\n成都得名在古蜀国从北向南迁都时，统治者想借光周朝先祖迁都得兴旺的运气，且寄望于这个新地方能够早日成为其国家的政治中心。所以就取其成为都城之意，命之为成都。所以成都这个地方作为一个城自诞生之时，就叫“成都”了。\n隋唐时期，成都经济发达，文化繁荣，佛教盛行。成都成为全国四大名城（长安、扬州、成都、敦煌）之第三位，农业、丝绸业、手工业、商业发达，造纸、印刷术发展很快，经济地位有所谓\"扬一益二\"（扬州第一，成都第二）。\"蜀绣\"为全国三大名绣之一，\"蜀锦\"被视为上贡珍品，产量全国第一。成都是中国雕板印刷术的发源地之一，唐代后期，大部分印刷品出自成都。成都除了有全国重要的菜市、蚕市外，还有\"草市\"，即分布在邻近地区的乡镇集市。唐代成都文学家云集，大诗人李白、杜甫、王勃、卢照邻、高适、岑参、薛涛、李商隐、雍陶、康术等短期旅居成都。唐代成都开发了开摩河池、百花潭等旅游胜地，贞观年间在城北修建了建元寺，唐朝大中年间改名为昭觉寺，称\"川西第一禅林\"。\n\n## 历史事件\n\n汉代时云南可走水路沿伊洛瓦底江顺流而下，出孟加拉湾航行到印度。与印度洋航道连接起来。《魏略·西戎传》记载，大秦国水道通益州永昌郡，当由缅甸海岸登陆而达永昌。《厄立特里业海航行记》关于印度东海岸以东地方的描述也可以印证这条路线。英国历史学家哈威在《缅甸史》中说，公元前2世纪以来，中国以缅甸为商业通道，“循伊洛瓦底江为一道、循萨尔温江为一道，尚有一道循弥诺江(chindwinr，今亲敦江)经曼尼普尔(Mannipur)乘马需三月乃至阿富汗。商人在其地以中国丝绸等名产，换取缅甸的宝石、翡翠、木棉；印度的犀角、象牙和欧洲的黄金等珍品”。",

政区沿革\n\n唐天授元年（690年）\n颁诏：“其并州宜置北都，改州为太原府。”此为太原建府之始。这时的北都太原府与京都长安，东都洛阳并称“三都”。唐玄宗天宝元年（742年）改北都为北京。太原称为北京、与西安长安，东京洛阳并称“三京”，进入唐代全盛时期。太原府治晋阳（太原市西南汾水东岸），下辖14县：太原、晋阳、榆次、阳曲、盂县、寿阳、乐平、太谷、祁县、文水、交城、清源、芦川、广阳（原名石艾）。五代十国时期，太原建置依唐未变。951-979间，为北汉首都。\n北宋太平兴国四年（979年），宋太宗亲征北汉，宋将潘美“进筑长连城围太原”。北汉割据势力降宋。赵氏对太原人民的多次反抗深恶痛绝，“诏毁太原旧城”，诏废并州太原府，废太原、晋阳二县。晋阳被火烧水灌夷为废墟。新置平晋县于汾水之东。新置并州军事，移治于榆次（晋中市榆次区）。同时依托唐明镇建太原新城。太平兴国七年（982年）“以（榆次）地非要会”，移并州军事治所于太原新城（今太原市）。下辖9县：阳曲（太原新城，即今太原市）、平晋、文水、祁县、太谷、榆次、清源、寿阳、盂县。\n金天会四年（1127年），女真族建立的金国，破宋都汴梁，掳去徽、钦二帝，废北宋太原大都督府，新置“太原河东军总管府”，府治阳曲，隶属河东北路。金初太原府下辖10县与北宋太原府辖区属县无异。大定二十九年（1189年）“析平晋、榆次、清源三县地，置徐沟县”属太原府。兴定年间，升置盂县为盂州，仍属太原府辖。是时太原府辖10县1州：阳曲、平晋、榆次、清源、徐沟、文水、祁县、交城、太谷、寿阳、盂州。\n元太祖（成吉思汗）十三年（1216年）伐金，攻取太原。元王朝建立后，废太原府置太原路，直归中书省。大德八年（1304年），元成宗诏颁改太原路为冀宁路。\n太原府隶属其下，辖6州、22县。其中府直辖13县：阳曲、榆次、太谷、祁县、徐沟、清源、交城、文水、寿阳、太原、盂县、静乐、河曲。6个州中，辖县州5个：平定州领乐平，忻州领定襄，代州领五台、繁峙、崞县，岢岚州领岚县、兴县，永宁州领宁乡、临县，保德州不辖县。明万历朝调整地方建置，把太原府所属的汾州、永宁州划出，新建汾州府，太原府所辖州为5，所辖县降为20县，其中府辖县仍为13，州辖县降至7。\n清代太原府，隶属山西行省，府治阳曲县，依旧辖5州20县。一仍明代旧置。雍正二年（1724年）把太原府所辖平定、代、保德、忻4个州划出，升置为直属山西省辖的直隶州。同时还划出太原府直隶县盂县、寿阳、静乐3县和州辖县乐平、定襄、五台、崞县、繁峙、河曲、兴县7县，分属上述4个直隶州。\n太原府所辖州县大为缩减，降至1州10县：阳曲、太原、榆次、太谷、清源、徐沟、祁县、交城、文水。岢岚州，州下辖岚县。雍正八年（1730年）又划出保德直隶州所属兴县，归属岢岚州。太原府又辖1州、11县。乾隆二十年（1763年）将清源县并入徐沟县。此后太原府下辖1州10县，府治阳曲，终至清亡。\n\n###

历史文化\n\n泼水节\n泼水节傣语称“摆爽南”，德昂语称“拱拍”，阿昌人称“浇花节”。它是傣历新年，是一年中最为盛大而隆重的节日。泼水节的来历传说较多，现普遍流传的是，很多年以前，有一个魔法无边的魔王，刀箭不入，水淹不死，火烧不烂，无恶不作。他抢来12个美丽的姑娘做妻子，个个恨死魔王。最小的聪明机敏，一直在想办法杀死这个妖魔。一天，终于从魔王口中探出秘密，只要用魔王的一根头发勒住魔王的脖子，就能把魔王的头勒下来。可是妖魔的头落地后，滚到哪里，哪里就大火成灾。为了使人间免除灾难，12个姑娘只好轮流抱着魔王头。于是人们用清水替姑娘冲洗身上的污秽，年复一年，形成了泼水节。节期是傣历12月31日至1月2日，在清明后7天到10天内举行。1983年4月，德宏州第八届人民代表大会第一次会议决定将其定为民族民间传统节日，节期固定为阳历4月12日至14日。节日清晨，人们把头天采来的鲜花供奉在佛前，并于中午前把佛寺内的佛像搬出来，放在龙亭子里，先用刚打来的清水浴佛，然后按年长辈分互相有礼貌地用花木枝叶蘸水洒泼对方，人们互相泼水，以示祝福，唱歌跳舞，夜晚放焰火和孔明灯等，整个节期内热闹非凡。傣族、德昂族及阿昌族认为，泼水可以消灾祛病，身体健康；相互泼水是尊敬、爱慕，给予对方吉祥如意。\n\n目瑙纵歌节\n目瑙纵歌节是景颇族传统祭祀的盛大节日，源于创世英雄宁贯娃的故事。景颇支叫“目瑙”，载佤、浪哦、喇赤等支叫“纵歌”，统称“目瑙纵歌”，是大伙跳舞的意思。节期一般都选定在农历正月中旬。1983年4月9日经德宏州第八届人民代表大会第一次会议决定，每年正月15日至16日为景颇族目瑙纵歌节。节日期间，景颇族男女老少身穿盛装，一早结队汇集到目瑙纵歌广场进行欢庆。目瑙纵歌典礼开始，敲锣打鼓，鸣枪放炮，笙管齐奏，在一派欢乐声中，由4位德高望重的老人，头戴插有美丽的孔雀翎或雉鸡鸟冠帽，手中挥动闪亮的景颇长刀，领着目瑙纵歌队伍，踏着鼓点，吹响“桑比”，边歌边舞。舞场中央翌立有高大的“目瑙示栋”标志，上刻目瑙纵歌线路（以示景颇族祖先由青藏高原南迁的曲折过程），人们围着“目瑙栋”，踏着鼓点，吹响“桑比”，尽情歌舞，参舞者少至数百，多至数千人，故有“万人舞”之称。目瑙纵歌从早跳到晚，通宵达旦，气势壮观。\n阿露窝罗节\n阿露窝罗节是阿昌族传统节日，是为纪念传说中的遮帕麻和遮咪麻为民除害、造福人类而举行的。每年农历正月初四举行。节日期间，远近村寨的阿昌人身穿节日盛装，抬着扎制的挂着红彩的白象和青龙，手持青枝绿叶，汇集在事先指定的村寨，围绕着舞场中央竖起的“阿露窝罗”标志，放鞭炮，唱“窝罗”，踏着“龙形虎步”在象脚鼓乐声中耍龙舞象，尽兴狂欢。1983年4月9日，德宏州第八届人民代表大会第一次会议决定“阿露窝罗节”为阿昌族的法定节日，每年阳历3月20日举行，节期2天。\n阔时节\n阔时节亦称“拉歌”节，意为新年歌舞节。每年正月初九举行，节期2天。1983年4月9日，德宏州第八届人民代表大会第一次会议决定将其定为傈僳族的法定民族节日。节日里活动内容丰富多彩，除夕之夜，老人以酒、肉、粑粑为祭祀天地祖先神灵，为感谢耕牛一年劳作、家犬给人类带来谷种，先给它们品尝一点年节食品。人们身着节日盛装，来到选定的场址，聚集在一起吹笙、笛，弹篾弦、三弦等乐器，载歌载舞，通宵达旦，欢庆佳节。同时举行火炮、弩箭、射击等民间体育比赛及对歌等活动。\n\n## 地方特产\n\n咖啡\n咖啡产业在德宏傣族景颇族自治州的发展经历了零星种植、规模化种植、产业化发展三个阶段，截至2009年底，全州咖啡种植面积达12.09万亩，年产咖啡干豆1万多吨，已成为中国最大的咖啡种植和加工基地。2009年10月，德宏傣族景颇族自治州正式向“中国特产之乡”推荐暨宣传活动组织委员会提出申报成为“中国咖啡之乡”的申请。2010年4月20日，“中国咖啡之乡—云南省德宏州”授牌仪式在北京人民大会堂重庆厅隆重举行，德宏州正式被评为“中国咖啡之乡”。\n遮放米\n德宏是著名的鱼米之乡，风调雨顺，土地肥沃，盛产粮食。“芒市谷子遮放米”一说广为流传。据说遮放米曾是历史上有名的“贡米”，其米质晶莹剔透，米香十里之外可闻，难怪皇帝老爷要亲口尝一尝。\n涮涮辣\n如果有“吹牛大王”敢说他吃尽天下辣椒也不会耳赤心跳，那就带他到德宏来吧，让“涮涮辣”闹他个天翻地覆。德宏盛产的“涮涮辣”可算是辣中之王，据说其辣味比其他辣椒高出二三十倍，用“涮涮辣”调制蘸水碟，只需点到为止，\n在蘸水碟里打个滚，其辛辣之味就已至极。\n昆虫食\n德宏的傣族、景颇族和德昂族，除食用一般的植物、动物食品外，至今还保留着人类早期以昆虫为食品的习惯。蚂蚁蛋、竹虫、蜂蛹、花蜘蛛等等来制作美味佳肴\n若将竹虫蛹干作下酒菜，是待客的上品。然而最不同凡响的是还吃一种个体很大、身体上有黄黑相间的花斑、结黄网的花蜘蛛。这种蜘蛛有拇指那样大，少年儿童们最喜捕捉。他们将捕到的花蜘蛛放在火上烤，去肢脚，蜕去一层皮后，夹在糯米饭或软米饭中当菜吃，其味不亚于烤肉。此外，他们还从地穴里挖一种景颇语称做“起柯”的“牛屎虫”的蛹，这种蛹较大，一般都有两三个拇指那样粗，将从地穴挖出来的白色蛹，洗净后放在锅里稍煮片刻，捞起来配上佐料可与鸡蛋一起煎食，这种蛹蛋白质含量很丰富。\n蚂蚁蛋是傣家的一道民间传统美食。凉拌蚂蚁蛋，味道可美啦，有时盘中的一粒粒蚂蚁蛋足有豌豆那么大，状如猪腰子，外观白嫩，表面有一层薄膜，看着就有悦目爽心之感。用筷子轻轻地搛起一粒来，放进口中一咬，蛋味鲜美至极，叫人禁不住满口生津。蚂蚁蛋虽然好吃，却极为难得。食用的蚂蚁蛋，都是生长在树上的大黄蚂蚁所产的。爬上树去取蛋时，免不要承受蚂蚁叮咬之苦，因而在傣族民间，早就有“不是强者，休想吃到蚂蚁蛋”的说法。\n傣家人食用蚂蚁蛋，主要是凉拌，将蚂蚁蛋洗净，放在沸水里烫熟，然后加入蒜、盐、醋等调料，再加上自己喜爱的蔬菜即可食用。\n傣家和景颇人都喜爱蜂蛹，但要想得到蜂蛹，难度是可想而知的。蜂蛹一般都极为难取，取蜂蛹时不免要受叮咬之苦。但蜂蛹的美味又让人们铤而走险，蜂蛹还是一道下酒的好菜。\n\n##

{"name": "魁北克省", "documents": ["## 魁北克省\n魁北克省（Québec，Quebec），简称魁省，是加拿大一个联邦省份。NoteTag|虽然魁北克位于加拿大东部，但它从历史观点上和政治上的原因，也被认为属于中加拿大（包括安大略）。据加拿大统计局2021年数据，全区人口为8,501,833人。魁北克官方语言为法语不包括英语，是加拿大唯一不以英语为官方语言的行政区划。，北美的法语人口主要集中在此。首府魁北克市，最大城市蒙特利尔。\n魁北克是加拿大最大的联邦省份也是第二大的一级行政区，仅次于努纳武特；在西与安大略省、詹姆斯湾以及哈德森湾接壤，北接哈得逊海峡与昂加瓦湾，在东与圣罗伦斯湾、纽芬兰-拉布拉多省和新伯伦瑞克省相邻，南邻美国的缅因州、新罕布夏州、佛蒙特州以及纽约州，并与努纳武特、爱德华王子岛以及新斯科细亚共享海上边界。\n魁北克是加拿大人口次多的联邦省份，仅次于安大略省，多数居民住在邻近圣罗伦斯河的都市-蒙特娄以及魁北克市，其中魁北克市也是该省首府，英裔人口大多居住西部的蒙特利尔，现在加蒂诺、东部乡镇以及加斯佩半岛地区也有相当多数的英裔人口，位于北方的北魁北克地区则占据该省大半部的地区，该地以原住民因纽特人居多并要求和魁北克分离。\n## 词源与边界变迁\n魁北克（Québec）这个名称源自于阿尔冈昆语词汇「kébec」，意指河川收窄之处，传统上是指魁北克市的周围地区，亦即圣罗伦斯河收窄至两岸皆面临悬崖的地域。早期该词也有其他的拼法例如：Québecq（Levasseur, 1601）和Kébec（Lescarbot, 1609）。法国探险家尚普兰在1608年选择了Québec为法属殖民地新法兰西行政中心的称呼。该省通常也有「美丽之省」（\"La belle province\"）的意涵。\n七年战争结束后，英法两国于1763年签订《巴黎和约》，法国将法属加拿大割让予英国，英国并于同年公布《1763年皇家宣言》，正式成立魁北克省；这份谕令规定全省限缩于圣罗伦斯河的河畔。英国再于1774年通过《魁北克法案》，将魁北克省的范围延伸至包括五大湖、俄亥俄河河谷和鲁珀特地区（Rupert's Land）的南部，大致恢复该省在法国管治时期的边界。美国独立战争结束后，英美在1783年签订的《巴黎条约》约定把五大湖区以南的领地划为美国所辖。在1791年的《宪法法案》颁布后，魁北克省一分为二，分别为下加拿大（今日的魁北克）和上加拿大（今日的安大略省），这两个领地都可以选举出自己的议会。1840年英国国会通过联合法案，上加拿大改称西加拿大，下加拿大改称东加拿大，两者并统编成加拿大联合省。1867年后这两处地区又改称魁北克和安大略，他们成为加拿大建国的最初四个省份。\n1870年加拿大向哈德逊湾公司购买鲁珀特地区，在未来的数十年间加拿大国会把这块土地的部分范围续划进魁北克的领地内，使其扩张到原先领地的三倍。1898年国会通过魁北克边界扩张法案，使其在北方的边界延伸至原住民的居住地，随后在1912年的扩张法案中把昂加瓦地区（District of Ungava）划进魁北克使住在极北方的伊努特人居住地被划进魁北克，也造成今日魁北克省的边界。1927年英国枢密院司法委员会为该省与纽芬兰-拉布拉多间的边界划定界线；魁北克政府至今仍驳斥这次边界的划分。\n## 地理\n魁北克省占地广袤，是加拿大第一大省（连同地区计则仅次于努纳武特），面积约为中国广东省的十倍。省内大部地区人口稀少。魁北克省超过90%的地区位于加拿大地盾。北部广阔，无人居住。魁北克位于加拿大东部，西接安大略省和哈德逊湾，东邻大西洋诸省，南部与美国接壤（缅因州、新罕布什尔州、佛蒙特州和纽约州），北部直抵北冰洋。\n省内最大的水电工程建立在La Grande Rivière（大河）上。极北处属极地和副极地气候，有部分因纽特部族居住于此。\n人口最稠密区域在南部的圣劳伦斯河谷，省会魁北克城和蒙特利尔均处于此。蒙特利尔北部为劳伦第安区，是地质年代久远的山区，东部为阿巴拉契亚山脉，一直延伸到东城和加斯佩地区。加斯佩半岛向东伸入圣劳伦斯湾。位于南部的圣劳伦斯河谷和北部的加拿大地盾是魁北克最主要两个地形区并且两地区差异十分大。\n### 水文\n魁北克为世界上最大的淡水供水区之一 p=5，涵盖当地12%的表面 p=39，并拥有3%的可再生淡水而当地址居住0.1%的魁省总人口，超过五十万个湖泊，至少30个湖泊大于250平方公里， p=5大约4,500条河川都流往贯穿圣罗伦斯河注入大西洋 p=5、经詹姆斯湾（James Bay）、哈德逊湾以及昂加瓦湾（Ungava Bay），最大的岛屿坐落在卡尼帕斯卡水库（Réservoir de Caniapiscau），其为詹姆士湾计划的项目之一并且带来水力发电，米斯塔西尼湖（Lac Mistassini）则是魁北克最大的湖泊。\n世界上流入大西洋的河川中，拥有最大港口的就是位于圣罗伦斯河的蒙特娄（魁省最大的城市）、三河市以及魁北克市（魁省首府），他们衔接北极海与北美内部，因此成为17世纪到18世纪法国早期在美洲殖民的基地。1959年圣罗伦斯海道成为连接五大湖区和大西洋的捷径。魁北克市东北也就是圣罗伦斯河的出海是世界上最大的海湾，该处蕴藏丰富的鲸鱼、鱼群以及海鸟。该河流入圣罗伦斯湾，海底资源促使鱼夫以及小型港口在魁省的下圣劳伦斯地区、北岸 (魁北克省)以及加斯佩半岛地区之兴盛。这个区域成为魁北克在数个世纪的发展历久不衰，与此同时殖民者在各地特所资源丰富的河川，例如阿胥普密需河（Rivière Ashuapmushuan）、邱迪尔河（Rivière Chaudière）、加蒂诺河（Rivière Gatineau）、马尼夸根河（Rivière Manicouagan）、渥太华河、黎塞留河（Rivière Richelieu）、鲁珀特河（Rivière Rupert）、萨格奈河（Rivière Saguenay）、圣弗朗索瓦河（Rivière Saint-François）以及圣莫里斯河。\n### 地志\n魁北克的最高峰为卡布维克峰（魁北克又称为Mont d'Iberville），海拔为1,652米。该山脉坐落于该省东北部与纽芬兰与拉布拉多的边界处的Torngat Mountains。魁北克人口最为稠密的地区为圣劳伦斯低地，它从东北部延伸至该省西南部的沿着圣劳伦斯河的河岸到魁北克市的一些地区。该区域北部为Laurentian Mountains，东南部为阿巴拉契亚山脉。\n### 植被\n魁北克因该省地质及气候影响进而产生多样性的植被，这些地区从最北到最南依次是：苔原、寒温带针叶林、Boreal forest of Canada、温带阔叶混合林和落叶林。\n在昂加瓦湾和哈德逊海峡的周围为苔原并覆盖了魁北克超过24%的面积，其植物区系仅限于能在-8°C 的年平均温度下存活下来的低矮地衣植被，每年更只有不到50天的生长天数 。再往南，气候有利于寒温带针叶林的生长，并因位在加拿大地盾副极地地区的关系使得该植被不像苔原那样干旱，其特点是植物（共600种）和动物（共206种）物种数量更多，其中许多都全年生活在此，寒温带针叶林覆盖了魁北克总面积的20％。\n加拿大北方森林为魁北克最大之植被包含了加拿大地盾和，共覆盖魁北克高达27％的面积，并由于较暖和的气候使得生物多样性也使之提高，因此大约栖息著850种植物和280种脊索动物 。温带阔叶混合林为加拿大北方森林和落叶林之间的过渡区，覆盖了魁北克约11.5%的面积为洛朗蒂德、绍迪耶尔-阿巴拉契亚和东圣罗伦斯低地的植被特征，由于其过渡带的性质，尽管温度相对较低，该地区仍包含多种栖息地，拥有大量植物（共1000 种种）和脊索动物（共350 种种）物种栖息。落叶林由于其年均温高于7°C的气候，使该地区拥最高有的物种多样性，包括1600多种维管植物和440种脊索动物；更因该区含有将近200天的生长季以及肥沃的土壤使其成为魁北克的农业活动中心，因此更成为魁北克城市化的中心，使得约占魁北克6.6%总面积的圣罗伦斯河岸具集了该省的大部分人 。\n魁北克的森林总面积估计为750300平方公里。从阿比蒂比-泰米斯卡曼格到北岸森林主要由针叶树组成，如胶冷杉、白云杉、Picea mariana、北美短叶松和Larix laricina。沿著圣罗伦斯河向南前进会开始出现些许落叶树，例如Betula alleghaniensis。在南圣罗伦斯低地的落叶林地区主要由落叶树种组成，如糖枫、北美红橡、美国榆树、北美椴树、Juglans cinerea、Fraxinus americana、Acer rubrum、Carya cordiformis和Fagus grandifolia以及些许针叶树如北美乔松和北美香柏。而Populus tremuloides、Sorbus americana和北美白桦则广泛分布在魁北克半数以上的地区。\n## 历史\n“魁北克”这个名字源于美洲原住民语言，原义是峡湾。原住民用此词来指现魁北克市处圣劳伦斯河口处。圣劳伦斯河从西流至此地豁然开阔。\n最早来此地的欧洲探险家是雅克·卡蒂亚（Jacques Cartier），他于1534年到达加斯佩地区，1535年航入圣劳伦斯河。\n1627年后，法王路易十三下令，除罗马天主教外的移民不得在新法兰西定居。此举保证殖民地的教育和福利都掌握在教会的手中。1663年新法兰西成为王室直属省，由让·塔隆管辖。\n1763年，英国同法王路易十五签署巴黎条约，法国放弃新法兰西以换取继续拥有西印度群岛的瓜德罗普。英国人将加拿大（当时新法兰西的一部分）改名为魁北克省。\n1774年英国议会通过《Quebec Act》，该法案确保魁北克地区的法语和法国文化不受威胁。这个法案还允许魁北克保留法国的欧陆法系和整个法律体系，同时也保障宗教自由。罗马天主教得以保留。\n美国革命后，很多英裔保皇党-{zh-hans:涌;zh-hant:涌}-入加拿大，改变了人口构成。为此，1791年宪法法案以渥太华河为界，将原有的殖民地分成两块。西部为上加拿大，改用英国法律系统，东部为下加拿大，维持原状。\n1841年英国政府将上下加拿大并为加拿大省。1867年加拿大省与另两个英属殖民地新不伦瑞克和新斯科舍合并为加拿大联盟，而加拿大省本身却又分成安大略和魁北克两个部分。\n1944年至1960年，在天主教会的支持下，Maurice Duplessis领导国民联盟实现长达16年的保守派执政期。皮埃尔·特鲁多和其他自由派知识分子对杜普乐斯保守党政府的批评为Jean Lesage和魁北克自由党所领导的寂静革命奠定基础。1960年代的寂静革命导致魁北克社会和政治格局的巨大变化。罗马天主教会影响迅速衰落，魁北克水电公司被国有化，政府从天主教会手中取回对教育和医疗的控制，于此同时，瑞内·勒维克（René Lévesque）领导的魁北克独立运动也开始抬头。\n1960年代，恐怖主义组织“魁北克解放阵线”实行长达十年的反政府行动。1968年他们绑架英国贸易专员克罗斯和魁北克省劳动厅厅长拉波特，拉波特数日后被害。\n1977年，勒维克领导魁北克人党赢得省选，独立形势日益加重。勒维克颁布《法语宪章》（又称101法案）。此法案确立法语在魁北克作为唯一官方语言的地位。至今，魁北克各地所有标志一律由法语标明；此法案仍倍受争议。\n1980年，全省就主权问题在举行第一次全民公投，选民中百分之六十的魁北克人投票反对。\n1995年10月30日魁北克第二次关于独立问题的公投再次未被通过，这一次，双方选票非常接近（50.6％反对对49.4％赞成）。\n## 政治\n魁北克省督是国家元首查理斯三世在该地区的代表。魁北克省省长也可以称为“premier ministre”，由议会多数党领袖担任。魁北克省议会是以西敏制为基础的一院制，名为“魁北克国民议会”（Assemblée nationale du Québec）。受法国殖民时期的影响，魁北克的司法系统使用欧陆法系，而非普通法，也是北美唯二使用欧陆法系的地区（及美国路易斯安那州）。\n魁北克独立运动在该省政坛扮演了要角。现执政党为支持魁北克民族主义和魁北克自治的魁北克未来联盟，最大反对党为反对魁北克独立和支持加拿大联邦体系的魁北克自由党；魁北克人党则倡导建立魁北克独立的国家主权，并曾分别于1980年以及1995年针对独立举行公投，但两次公投均未获通过。2006年11月，时任加拿大总理的史提芬·哈珀在加拿大国会提出Québécois nation motion，承认魁北克为加拿大的一个“邦国”（nation）。活跃于加拿大联邦政坛的魁人政团也来自于魁北克。\n## 经济\n圣劳伦斯河是魁北克经济的命脉，著名的圣劳伦斯海道连接了大西洋和五大湖区。圣劳伦斯河谷是富饶的农业区，盛产奶制品、水果、蔬菜和牲畜，河谷以北多针叶林，河流湖泊众多，因而纸浆、造纸、林业和水电也是该省重要的经济活动。魁北克也有丰富矿产资源，以铁、铝及贵金属矿为主，采矿业主要集中于北岸地区和阿比蒂比-蒂米斯坎明格地区。总部位于加拿大铝业集团是加拿大最大的铝矿公司，2007年全球采矿业巨头力拓集团收购Alcan后，该公司成为全球最大的铝业公司。\n航空航天和制造业在魁北克也有重要地位，运输设备巨头庞巴迪公司、航天设备商加拿大航空电子设备集团等公司皆来自魁北克，而世界重要的航空航天组织如国际航空运输协会和国际民用航空组织都将总部设在魁北克。金融、传媒、信息技术、生物技术以及制药业等行业也是魁北克的支柱产业，知名的公司有3D技术服务商Softimage和Autodesk传媒娱乐部、电信业巨头加拿大贝尔集团、金融业蒙特利尔银行等。\n##教育\n虽然法语为魁北克的官方语言，但是根据加拿大政府通过的《官方语言法令》和《加拿大权利与自由宪章》第十六条中，英语和法语均被认可为加拿大的官方语言，因此该省既有法语学校也有英语学校。除学前班、小学、中学和大学外，魁北克有全加拿大特有的CEGEP系统。该省的魁北克大学是加拿大最庞大的大学系统，有超过87,000名学生。位于省府魁北克市的拉瓦尔大学是世界著名的法语学府，坐落于蒙特利尔的英语学府麦吉尔大学是加拿大最古老的高等院校，在全球享负盛誉，被视为“加拿大的哈佛”，为加拿大培养了12位诺贝尔奖得主和3位加拿大总理。此外该省还有英语学府康考迪亚大学、主教大学及法语学府蒙特利尔大学、Université de Sherbrooke。\n## 文化\n魁北克人是美洲最大的法语族裔。大部分说法语的加拿大人住在魁北克。其它加拿大法语聚居区，多数和魁北克有着程度不一的联系（大西洋省份的阿卡迪亚人除外）。\n蒙特利尔是仅次于金沙萨与巴黎的第三大法语城市。由于历史原因，魁北克成了多种文化交融的地方。全世界各国的人来到这里体验北美，却又和北美主流保持了一段小距离。魁北克经常被描述为欧洲和美洲的十字路口，在这里，人们可以同时体验到美国、法国和英国文化的魅力。\n魁北克也是11个原住民文化的故乡，省内还有六十万左右的英语少数民族。\n魁北克的格言是Je me souviens（我牢记在心），这句话的原文是：Je me souviens, Que né sous le lys, Je croîs sous la rose.（我牢记在心，我是在百合花（法国王室纹章花形）下出生的，在玫瑰花（英格兰王室纹章花形）下长大的。）这句话刻在魁北克省议会大楼的前面。魁北克省徽及车牌上也有这句话。\n魁北克的图案象征是鸢尾花，一般为白色蓝底。魁北克的省旗是蓝底白色十字，四角各有一朵鸢尾。这个旗帜是1948年被确定为省旗的。省徽顶部为三朵黄色百合，象征法国王室。中部为代表英国王室的金狮，下部为代表本地人民的三叶枫树枝。魁北克省花为鸢尾。魁北克曾经用百合花（法国的象征）作为省花，后被本地产的鸢尾替代。魁北克省鸟为雪鸮。魁北克省树为黄桦树（bouleau jaune, merisier）。\n法语加拿大的守护圣人是施洗者约翰。自1977年来，圣约翰日（6月24日）是魁北克官方省庆日。民族主义者Gilles Vigneault所作的歌曲“国家的人民”（Gens du pays）常被当作魁北克的非正式国歌。\n魁北克有时候也被称做“La Belle Province”（美丽省）。70年代前这个词组被用在汽车牌照上。70年代以后被官方格言“Je me souviens”（我牢记在心）所替代。\n## 行政区划\n魁北克全省被分为17个行政“地区”，分别是：", "# 魁北克省\n\n魁北克省(法语：Québec 英语：Quebec)，为加拿大的一级行政单位，加拿大面积第一大省，截至2015年，总面积为166.7万平方公里，人口823万，超过80%的人口为法国后裔，是北美地区的法国文化中心，官方语言为法语。\n魁北克省位于加拿大东南部，北濒哈得逊湾，东临拉布拉多地区和圣劳伦斯湾，南接美国，西连安大略省和詹姆斯湾，为加拿大和北美洲东部的交通要道。首府魁北克市，最大城市蒙特利尔。\n\n2014年，魁北克省实现国民生产总值\n\n##

象征\n\n魁北克的图案象征是鸢尾花，一般为白色蓝底。魁北克的省旗是蓝底白色十字，四角各有一朵鸢尾。这个旗帜是1948年被确定为省旗的。蓝底白色十字曾经是法兰西王国的国旗。省徽顶部为三朵黄色百合，象征法国王室。中部为代表英国王室的金狮，下部为代表本地人民的三叶枫树枝。\n魁北克省花为鸢尾，魁北克曾经用百合\n自1977年来，圣约翰日\n\n### 多元文化\n\n魁北克人是美洲最大的法语族裔，大部分说法语的加拿大人住在魁北克。其它加拿大法语聚居区，多数和魁北克有着程度不一的联系巴黎的第二大说法语的城市。由于历史的原因，魁北克成了一个多种文化交融的地方。全世界各国的人来到这里体验北美，却又和北美主流保持了一段小距离。\n魁北克省经常被描述为欧洲和美洲的十字路口，既继承了法国的传统和文化，又沿袭了英国的议会制度。人们可以同时在这里体验到美国、法国和英国的文化。魁北克也是11个原住民文化的故乡，省内还有六十万左右的英语少数民族。\n\n### 冬季嘉年华会\n\n冬季嘉年华会是魁北克省居民最盛大的节日，节日于每年2月开始，号称世界最大的冬季游行，具有典型法兰西文化特色。节前，要用雪筑成一座五层高的“雪之城堡”；节日期间，要推选一位“狂欢节之王”，作为魁北克市的临时“统治者”，他身穿白衣，头戴白帽，扮成雪人的模样。在破冰后的圣劳伦斯河上要举行传统的“冰河竞舟”。还要在冰、雪上举行其它各种活动。\n\n## 旅游\n\n魁北克城\n魁北克城是魁北克省首府，加拿大东部重要城市和港口，位于圣劳伦斯河与圣查尔斯河汇合处。全城分新区老区两部分。新市区高楼林立，商业繁荣，一派现代化城市风貌。旧市区仍保有18世纪时法国城市的风貌，这里挂有18世纪牌匾的店铺商行比比皆是，店员身着古装、梳古老发型。\n魁北克是北美最古老的城市，北美洲历史文化名城，名胜古迹甚多，为墨西哥以北唯一留有古老城墙的美洲城市，被联合国教科文组织评为世界级的古迹保存地。该地不仅语言属法语系，其日常生活，鹅卵石街道，法式建筑，石造教堂等，均展现着中世纪欧洲风格。\n\n圣安妮大教堂\n在1888年，教区内的教堂流传著曾发生过这样的奇迹：有3位正在做礼拜的教徒经过圣母玛利亚的雕像前，突然圣母的眼睛睁开了。从那时候起，数以百万计的朝圣者都往这儿聚集。在1960年～1969年期间，还兴建了一栋八边形的教堂来接收这些新的朝圣者。就建筑而言，它的设计精致得彷佛一颗珠宝那么令人迷眩，拥有哥德式精美的彩绘玻璃。\n奥林匹克公园\n位于魁北克省蒙特利尔市的奥林匹克公园是1976年举行蒙特利尔夏季奥运会的旧址，这座露天运动场以及其倾斜的塔台已成为蒙特利尔的一个象征，塔高约50公尺圣罗伦斯河的风景，园内经常举行贸易会及一些表演。\n\n圣劳伦斯河\n圣劳伦斯河是北美洲中东部的大水系，连接美国明尼苏达州圣路易河的源头和加拿大东端通往大西洋的卡伯特海峡，流经北美内陆约4000千米。河上的观鲸游轮之旅从每年7月中旬至9月份，该时间段内，靠近莎圭纳河的圣劳伦斯河成为大量鲸鱼的家乡。游客可搭乘船艇，从泰道沙克出发从而近距离观看这群巨大的哺乳类动物。\n\n圣若瑟礼拜堂\n圣若瑟礼拜堂，是一座罗马天主教堂，位于魁北克省蒙特利尔的皇家山西南角，为北美洲最多信徒朝圣之圣地。1904年，圣十字架会会士圣安德烈·贝塞在皇家山附近的圣母书院开始兴建一座小教堂，不久就由于访问者增多而感到太小，1917年扩建成有1000座位的新的教堂，1924年再次改建，于1967年完工。圣安德烈·贝塞在此医治了不少伤残人士，据说教堂内所挂着的旧拐杖都是一些被医治好之残疾人仕留下的。教堂上盖是铜造的圆拱形屋顶，教堂内陈列着雕刻精致的十字架及苦像，圣安德烈·贝塞的遗体也葬于此。", "# 魁北克省\n魁北克省（法语：Québec，英语：Quebec），简称魁省，是加拿大一个联邦省份。据加拿大统计局2021年数据，全区人口为8,501,833人。魁北克官方语言为法语，北美的法语人口主要集中在此。首府魁北克市，最大城市蒙特利尔。\n魁北克是加拿大最大的联邦省份也是第二大的一级行政区，仅次于努纳武特；在西与安大略省、詹姆斯湾以及哈德森湾接壤，北接哈德森海峡与昂加瓦湾，在东与圣劳伦斯湾、纽芬兰-拉布拉多省和新伯伦瑞克省相邻，南邻美国的缅因州、新罕布什尔州、佛蒙特州以及纽约州，并与努纳武特、爱德华王子岛以及新斯科舍共享海上边界。\n魁北克是加拿大人口次多的联邦省份，仅次于安大略省，多数居民住在邻近圣劳伦斯河的都市-蒙特利尔以及魁北克市，其中魁北克市也是该省首府，英裔人口大多居住西部的蒙特利尔，现在加蒂诺、东部乡镇以及加斯佩半岛地区也有相当多数的英裔人口，位于北方的北魁北克地区则占据该省大半部的地区，该地以原住民因纽特人居多并要求和魁北克分离。\n## 词源与边界变迁\n魁北克（Québec）这个名称源自于阿尔冈昆语词汇“kébec”，意指河川收窄之处，传统上是指魁北克市的周围地区，亦即圣劳伦斯河收窄至两岸皆面临悬崖的地域。早期该词也有其他的拼法例如：Québecq（Levasseur, 1601）和Kébec（Lescarbot, 1609）。法国探险家尚普兰在1608年选择了Québec为法属殖民地新法兰西行政中心的称呼。该省通常也有“美丽之省”（\"La belle province\"）的意涵。\n七年战争结束后，英法两国于1763年签订《巴黎和约》，法国将法属加拿大割让予英国，英国并于同年公布《1763年皇家宣言》，正式成立魁北克省；这份谕令规定全省限缩于圣劳伦斯河的河畔。英国再于1774年通过《魁北克法案》，将魁北克省的范围延伸至包括五大湖、俄亥俄河河谷和鲁珀特地区（Rupert's Land）的南部，大致恢复该省在法国管治时期的边界。美国独立战争结束后，英美在1783年签订的《巴黎条约》约定把五大湖区以南的领地划为美国所辖。在1791年的《宪法法案》颁布后，魁北克省一分为二，分别为下加拿大（今日的魁北克）和上加拿大（今日的安大略省），这两个领地都可以选举出自己的议会。1840年英国国会通过联合法案，上加拿大改称西加拿大，下加拿大改称东加拿大，两者并统编成加拿大联合省。1867年后这两处地区又改称魁北克和安大略，他们成为加拿大建国的最初四个省份。\n1870年加拿大向哈德森湾公司购买鲁珀特地区，在未来的数十年间加拿大国会把这块土地的部分范围续划进魁北克的领地内，使其扩张到原先领地的三倍。1898年国会通过魁北克边界扩张法案，使其在北方的边界延伸至原住民的居住地，随后在1912年的扩张法案中把昂加瓦地区（District of Ungava）划进魁北克使住在极北方的伊努特人居住地被划进魁北克，也造成今日魁北克省的边界。1927年英国枢密院司法委员会为该省与纽芬兰-拉布拉多间的边界划定界线；魁北克政府至今仍驳斥这次边界的划分。\n## 地理\n魁北克省占地广袤，是加拿大第一大省（连同地区计则仅次于努纳武特），面积约为中国广东省的十倍。省内大部地区人口稀少。魁北克省超过90%的地区位于加拿大地盾。北部广阔，无人居住。魁北克位于加拿大东部，西接安大略省和哈德森湾，东邻大西洋诸省，南部与美国接壤（缅因州、新罕布什尔州、佛蒙特州和纽约州），北部直抵北冰洋。\n省内最大的水电工程建立在La Grande Rivière（大河）上。极北处属极地和副极地气候，有部分因纽特部族居住于此。\n人口最稠密区域在南部的圣劳伦斯河谷，省会魁北克城和蒙特利尔均处于此。蒙特利尔北部为劳伦第安区，是地质年代久远的山区，东部为阿巴拉契亚山脉，一直延伸到东城和加斯佩地区。加斯佩半岛向东伸入圣劳伦斯湾。位于南部的圣劳伦斯河谷和北部的加拿大地盾是魁北克最主要两个地形区并且两地区差异十分大。\n### 水文\n魁北克为世界上最大的淡水供水区之一，涵盖当地12%的表面，并拥有3%的可再生淡水而当地址居住0.1%的魁省总人口，超过五十万个湖泊，至少30个湖泊大于250平方千米，大约4,500条河川都流往贯穿圣劳伦斯河注入大西洋、经詹姆斯湾（James Bay）、哈德森湾以及昂加瓦湾（Ungava Bay），最大的岛屿坐落在卡尼帕斯卡尔水库（Réservoir de Caniapiscau），其为詹姆斯湾计划的项目之一并且带来水力发电，米斯塔西尼湖（Lac Mistassini）则是魁北克最大的湖泊。\n世界上流入大西洋的河川中，拥有最大港口的就是位于圣劳伦斯河的蒙特利尔（魁省最大的城市）、三河市以及魁北克市（魁省首府），他们衔接北极海与北美内部，因此成为17世纪到18世纪法国早期在美洲殖民的基地。1959年圣劳伦斯海道成为连接五大湖区和大西洋的捷径。魁北克市东北也就是圣劳伦斯河的出海是世界上最大的海湾，该处蕴藏丰富的鲸鱼、鱼群以及海鸟。该河流入圣劳伦斯湾，海底资源促使鱼夫以及小型港口在魁省的下圣劳伦斯地区、北岸 (魁北克省)以及加斯佩半岛地区之兴盛。这个区域成为魁北克在数个世纪的发展历久不衰，与此同时殖民者在各地特所资源丰富的河川，例如阿胥普密需河（Rivière Ashuapmushuan）、邱迪尔河（Rivière Chaudière）、加蒂诺河（Rivière Gatineau）、马尼夸根河（Rivière Manicouagan）、渥太华河、黎塞留河（Rivière Richelieu）、鲁珀特河（Rivière Rupert）、萨格奈河（Rivière Saguenay）、圣弗朗索瓦河（Rivière Saint-François）以及圣莫里斯河。\n### 地志\n魁北克的最高峰为卡布维克峰（魁北克又称为Mont d'Iberville），海拔为1,652米。该山脉坐落于该省东北部与纽芬兰与拉布拉多的边界处的托恩盖特山脉（英语：Torngat Mountains）。魁北克人口最为稠密的地区为圣劳伦斯低地，它从东北部延伸至该省西南部的沿着圣劳伦斯河的河岸到魁北克市的一些地区。该区域北部为劳伦山脉（英语：Laurentian Mountains），东南部为阿巴拉契亚山脉。\n### 植被\n魁北克因该省地质及气候影响进而产生多样性的植被，这些地区从最北到最南依次是：苔原、寒温带针叶林、加拿大北方森林（英语：Boreal forest of Canada）、温带阔叶混合林和落叶林。\n在昂加瓦湾和哈德森海峡的周围为苔原并覆盖了魁北克超过24%的面积，其植物区系仅限于能在-8°C 的年平均温度下存活下来的低矮地衣植被，每年更只有不到50天的生长天数 。再往南，气候有利于寒温带针叶林的生长，并因位在加拿大地盾副极地地区（英语：Subarctic）的关系使得该植被不像苔原那样干旱，其特点是植物（共600种）和动物（共206种）物种数量更多，其中许多都全年生活在此，寒温带针叶林覆盖了魁北克总面积的20％。\n加拿大北方森林为魁北克最大之植被包含了加拿大地盾和五大湖-圣劳伦斯低地（英语：Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands），共覆盖魁北克高达27％的面积，并由于较暖和的气候使得生物多样性也使之提高，因此大约栖息著850种植物和280种脊索动物 。温带阔叶混合林为加拿大北方森林和落叶林之间的过渡区，覆盖了魁北克约11.5%的面积为洛朗蒂德、绍迪耶尔-阿巴拉契亚和东圣劳伦斯低地（英语：Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands）的植被特征，由于其过渡带的性质，尽管温度相对较低，该地区仍包含多种栖息地，拥有大量植物（共1000 种种）和脊索动物（共350 种种）物种栖息。落叶林由于其年均温高于7°C的气候，使该地区拥最高有的物种多样性，包括1600多种维管植物和440种脊索动物；更因该区含有将近200天的生长季以及肥沃的土壤使其成为魁北克的农业活动中心，因此更成为魁北克城市化的中心，使得约占魁北克6.6%总面积的圣劳伦斯河岸具集了该省的大部分人 。\n魁北克的森林总面积估计为750300平方千米。从阿比蒂比-泰米斯卡曼格到北岸森林主要由针叶树组成，如胶冷杉、白云杉、黑云杉（英语：Picea mariana）、北美短叶松和北美落叶松（英语：Larix laricina）。沿着圣劳伦斯河向南前进会开始出现些许落叶树，例如黄桦（英语：Betula alleghaniensis）。在南圣劳伦斯低地（英语：Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands）的落叶林地区主要由落叶树种组成，如糖枫、北美红橡、美国榆树、北美椴树（英语：Tilia americana）、灰叶胡桃（英语：Juglans cinerea）、北美白梣（英语：Fraxinus americana）、北美红枫（英语：Acer rubrum）、心叶山核桃（英语：Carya cordiformis）和北美山毛榉（英语：Fagus grandifolia）以及些许针叶树如北美乔松和北美香柏。而颤杨（英语：Populus tremuloides）、北美花楸（英语：Sorbus americana）和北美白桦则广泛分布在魁北克半数以上的地区。\n## 历史\n“魁北克”这个名字源于美洲原住民语言，原义是峡湾。原住民用此词来指现魁北克市处圣劳伦斯河口处。圣劳伦斯河从西流至此地豁然开阔。\n最早来此地的欧洲探险家是雅克·卡蒂亚（Jacques Cartier），他于1534年到达加斯佩地区，1535年航入圣劳伦斯河。\n1627年后，法王路易十三下令，除罗马天主教外的移民不得在新法兰西定居。此举保证殖民地的教育和福利都掌握在教会的手中。1663年新法兰西成为王室直属省，由让·塔隆管辖。\n1763年，英国同法王路易十五签署巴黎条约，法国放弃新法兰西以换取继续拥有西印度群岛的瓜德罗普。英国人将加拿大（当时新法兰西的一部分）改名为魁北克省。\n1774年英国议会通过《魁北克法案（英语：Quebec Act）》，该法案确保魁北克地区的法语和法国文化不受威胁。这个法案还允许魁北克保留法国的欧陆法系和整个法律体系，同时也保障宗教自由。罗马天主教得以保留。\n美国革命后，很多英裔保皇党涌入加拿大，改变了人口构成。为此，1791年宪法法案以渥太华河为界，将原有的殖民地分成两块。西部为上加拿大，改用英国法律系统，东部为下加拿大，维持原状。\n1841年英国政府将上下加拿大并为加拿大省。1867年加拿大省与另两个英属殖民地新不伦瑞克和新斯科舍合并为加拿大联盟，而加拿大省本身却又分成安大略和魁北克两个部分。\n1944年至1960年，在天主教会的支持下，莫里斯·杜普乐斯（英语：Maurice Duplessis）领导国民联盟实现长达16年的保守派执政期。皮埃尔·特鲁多和其他自由派知识分子对杜普乐斯保守党政府的批评为让·勒萨格（英语：Jean Lesage）和魁北克自由党所领导的寂静革命奠定基础。1960年代的寂静革命导致魁北克社会和政治格局的巨大变化。罗马天主教会影响迅速衰落，魁北克水电公司被国有化，政府从天主教会手中取回对教育和医疗的控制，于此同时，瑞内·勒维克（René Lévesque）领导的魁北克独立运动也开始抬头。\n1960年代，恐怖主义组织“魁北克解放阵线”实行长达十年的反政府行动。1968年他们绑架英国贸易专员克罗斯和魁北克省劳动厅厅长拉波特，拉波特数日后被害。\n1977年，勒维克领导魁北克人党赢得省选，独立形势日益加重。勒维克颁布《法语宪章》（又称101法案）。此法案确立法语在魁北克作为唯一官方语言的地位。至今，魁北克各地所有标志一律由法语标明；此法案仍倍受争议。\n1980年，全省就主权问题在举行第一次全民公投，选民中百分之六十的魁北克人投票反对。\n1995年10月30日魁北克第二次关于独立问题的公投再次未被通过，这一次，双方选票非常接近（50.6％反对对49.4％赞成）。\n## 政治\n魁北克省督是国家元首查尔斯三世在该地区的代表。魁北克省省长也可以称为“premier ministre”，由议会多数党领袖担任。魁北克省议会是以威斯敏斯特体系为基础的一院制，名为“魁北克国民议会”（Assemblée nationale du Québec）。受法国殖民时期的影响，魁北克的司法系统使用欧陆法系，而非普通法，也是北美唯二使用欧陆法系的地区（及美国路易斯安那州）。\n魁北克独立运动在该省政坛扮演了要角。现执政党为支持魁北克民族主义和魁北克自治的魁北克未来联盟，最大反对党为反对魁北克独立和支持加拿大联邦体系的魁北克自由党；魁北克人党则倡导建立魁北克独立的国家主权，并曾分别于1980年以及1995年针对独立举行公投，但两次公投均未获通过。2006年11月，时任加拿大总理的斯蒂芬·哈珀在加拿大国会提出魁北克邦国化动议（英语：Québécois nation motion），承认魁北克为加拿大的一个“邦国”（nation）。活跃于加拿大联邦政坛的魁人政团也来自于魁北克。\n## 经济\n圣劳伦斯河是魁北克经济的命脉，著名的圣劳伦斯海道连接了大西洋和五大湖区。圣劳伦斯河谷是富饶的农业区，盛产奶制品、水果、蔬菜和牲畜，河谷以北多针叶林，河流湖泊众多，因而纸浆、造纸、林业和水电也是该省重要的经济活动。魁北克也有丰富矿产资源，以铁、铝及贵金属矿为主，采矿业主要集中于北岸地区和阿比蒂比-蒂米斯坎明格地区。总部位于加拿大铝业集团是加拿大最大的铝矿公司，2007年全球采矿业巨头力拓集团收购加拿大铝业公司（英语：Alcan）后，该公司成为全球最大的铝业公司。\n航空航天和制造业在魁北克也有重要地位，运输设备巨头庞巴迪公司、航天设备商加拿大航空电子设备集团等公司皆来自魁北克，而世界重要的航空航天组织如国际航空运输协会和国际民用航空组织都将总部设在魁北克。金融、传媒、信息技术、生物技术以及制药业等行业也是魁北克的支柱产业，知名的公司有3D技术服务商Softimage和Autodesk传媒娱乐部、电信业巨头加拿大贝尔集团、金融业蒙特利尔银行等。\n## 教育\n虽然法语为魁北克的官方语言，但是根据加拿大政府通过的《官方语言法令》和《加拿大权利与自由宪章》第十六条中，英语和法语均被认可为加拿大的官方语言，因此该省既有法语学校也有英语学校。除学前班、小学、中学和大学外，魁北克有全加拿大特有的CEGEP系统。该省的魁北克大学是加拿大最庞大的大学系统，有超过87,000名学生。位于省府魁北克市的拉瓦尔大学是世界著名的法语学府，坐落于蒙特利尔的英语学府麦吉尔大学是加拿大最古老的高等院校，在全球享负盛誉，被视为“加拿大的哈佛”，为加拿大培养了12位诺贝尔奖得主和3位加拿大总理。此外该省还有英语学府康考迪亚大学、主教大学及法语学府蒙特利尔大学、舍布鲁克大学（英语：Université de Sherbrooke）。\n## 文化\n魁北克人是美洲最大的法语族裔。大部分说法语的加拿大人住在魁北克。其它加拿大法语聚居区，多数和魁北克有着程度不一的联系（大西洋省份的阿卡迪亚人除外）。\n蒙特利尔是仅次于金沙萨与巴黎的第三大法语城市。由于历史原因，魁北克成了多种文化交融的地方。全世界各国的人来到这里体验北美，却又和北美主流保持了一段小距离。魁北克经常被描述为欧洲和美洲的十字路口，在这里，人们可以同时体验到美国、法国和英国文化的魅力。\n魁北克也是11个原住民文化的故乡，省内还有六十万左右的英语少数民族。\n魁北克的格言是Je me souviens（我牢记在心），这句话的原文是：Je me souviens, Que né sous le lys, Je croîs sous la rose.（我牢记在心，我是在百合花（法国王室纹章花形）下出生的，在玫瑰花（英格兰王室纹章花形）下长大的。）这句话刻在魁北克省议会大楼的前面。魁北克省徽及车牌上也有这句话。\n魁北克的图案象征是鸢尾花，一般为白色蓝底。魁北克的省旗是蓝底白色十字，四角各有一朵鸢尾。这个旗帜是1948年被确定为省旗的。省徽顶部为三朵黄色百合，象征法国王室。中部为代表英国王室的金狮，下部为代表本地人民的三叶枫树枝。魁北克省花为鸢尾。魁北克曾经用百合花（法国的象征）作为省花，后被本地产的鸢尾替代。魁北克省鸟为雪鸮。魁北克省树为黄桦树（bouleau jaune, merisier）。\n法语加拿大的守护圣人是施洗者约翰。自1977年来，圣约翰日（6月24日）是魁北克官方省庆日。民族主义者Gilles Vigneault所作的歌曲“国家的人民”（Gens du pays）常被当作魁北克的非正式国歌。\n魁北克有时候也被称做“La Belle Province”（美丽省）。70年代前这个词组被用在汽车牌照上。70年代以后被官方格言“Je me souviens”（我牢记在心）所替代。\n## 人口\n总人口：8,501,833（2021年） 人口增长率：4.1%（2016-2021年） 出生率：9.5‰（2020年） 死亡率：8.7‰（2020年） 婴儿死亡率：4.3‰（2020年） 预期寿命：（2020年） 男：80.6 女：84.0 城镇人口：81.1%（2016年） 母语：（2016年） 法语：6,377,080 (79.1%)

气候\n\n富瓦本应属于地中海气候。但由于其深居比利牛斯山内部，同时又属于背阳坡。山地气候明显，全年温差较大。夏季较热（但是和隔壁的图卢兹完全不是一个级别的），冬季寒冷多雪，春秋则多雷雨。气候湿润，但偶尔也会出现因焚风而产生的干热现象。\n\n## 发展历史\n\n### 起源\n\n富瓦诞生于中世纪前期。公元849年，这里修建了Saint-Volusien修道院。此后以此为中心，逐渐建立了一个小型城邦，这便是富瓦的雏形。\n\n### 中世纪后期\n\n公元10世纪，富瓦城堡开始修建。十三到十四世纪，富瓦发展到了历史的顶峰：此前富瓦已发展成为富瓦公国（Le comte de Foix）的国都。1211年到1217年间，驻守在这里的西蒙四世（Simon IV de Montfort）加强了堡垒的修建，故而同一时期的阿勒比圣战没有对富瓦造成什么影响。但接下来，1272年，偏安一隅的富瓦公国拒接接见当时的法兰西国王，此举引发了法兰西君主的不满。腓力三世（Phillipe le Hardi）率兵南下，最终征服了富瓦公国。1290年，富瓦公国与贝阿恩公国（Béarn）合并。富瓦逐渐丧失了政治地位，显赫一时的富瓦城堡也被改造成为了监狱。\n\n### 宗教战争\n\n16世纪，法国南方宗教战争兴起，富瓦也受到了不少影响。到了十六世纪中后期，富瓦市区的宗教类建筑大部分都被摧毁。波旁王朝的创建者亨利四世（Henri IV）最终于1582年拿下富瓦及周边地区。富瓦正式成为法国领土。\n\n### 法国大革命\n\n1790年，富瓦正式成为阿列日省（Arriège，后更名Ariège）的省会，此后从未改变。\n\n## 经济\n\n富瓦虽然是省会，但并不是阿列日省最大的城市。下属的帕米尔（Pamiers）位于富瓦以北，更靠近图卢兹，有接近1.5万人口，是阿列日省最大的城市。\n富瓦是法国仅有的两个人口未破万的省会城市（另一个是07号省的省会普里瓦）。由于地形原因，工农业发展受到了诸多障碍，大部分人都选择到图卢兹或者巴黎工作生活。富瓦主要靠旅游业发展，主要旅游景点为坐落在富瓦城区之上的富瓦城堡（Le Château）。此外富瓦以南的比利牛斯山区也是探险者和摄影家的天堂。同时，富瓦市区所在位置也是法国前往安道尔（Andorra）的必经之路。\n\n## 交通\n\n富瓦处于比利牛斯山区，和其他平原地区比起来较为落后\n。\n\n### 公路\n\n以富瓦为中心，前往主要城市的距离：\n距离图卢兹90公里（高速公路）\n距离巴黎779公里（高速公路）\n距离佩皮尼昂139公里（国道）\n距离卡尔卡松83公里（国道）\n距离塔布175公里（73公里为国道，其余为高速公路）\n距离帕米尔（Pamiers）20公里（高速公路）\n距离圣吉隆（Saint Girons）52公里（国道）\n\n### 长途汽车\n\n### 铁路\n\n富瓦火车站位于城区以北，阿列日河东岸。距离中心城区约1.5公里，大门方向背对着阿列日河\n。\n连接富瓦的是图卢兹——La Tour de Carol（法国与西班牙边境）铁路，该铁路穿行比利牛斯山区，且大部分为单线，因而平均旅速只有80Km/h左右。但该铁路全线电气化，因而运量又远大于其他山区铁路。向南到达La Tour de Carol之后可以转乘前往西班牙铁路公司（Renfe）担当的前往巴塞罗那方向的列车，还可以向东转乘著名的比利牛斯黄色小火车（Train Jaune），前往佩皮尼昂方向；向北1小时即可到达图卢兹，转乘前往全国各地的列车。\n每天晚上，都有一列夜班车从La Tour de Carol经过富瓦，然后北上直达巴黎。\n\\*注：奥尔良北即Les Aubrais Orléans，位于奥尔良站以北约3公里，有轨电车可连接。\n\n### 航空\n\n富瓦没有机场，市区距离图卢兹机场大约只有90公里\n\n### 公交\n\n## 教育\n\n富瓦的教育业比较落后。\n\n### 小学\n\nEcole primaire Lucien Goron\nEcole primaire de Cadirac\nEcole primaire le Cardie\nEcole primaire du Courbet\nEcole primaire des Bruilhols\n\n### 中学\n\n虽然富瓦本地也有一些中学，但大部分人还是选择去图卢兹念书。\nCollège Lakanal\nLycée général et technologique Gabriel Fauré\nLycée professionnel Jean Durroux\n\n### 大学\n\n阿列日大学城\n（Centre Universitaire Ariège），位于富瓦市区，包括以下教育机构：\n图卢兹第二大学旅游管理学院（ISTHIA）\n图卢兹第二大学地理与环境系\n（Antenne de l'Université de Toulouse II à Foix）\n\n## 旅游\n\n### 景点\n\n富瓦城堡（Le Château de Foix）\n\n富瓦城堡位于富瓦市中心偏北，一处地势较高的岩石上。现存的富瓦城堡建于十二到十四世纪，由以下三部分组成：\n北侧：一个正方形的堡垒，是三个城堡中历史最悠久的，最早建于10世纪初，新建后又在19世纪加装了屋顶。\n中间：建于13到14世纪，城堡内有装饰精美的灯具、徽章、拱门和各种雕塑。\n圆形堡垒：建筑年代偏晚，属于哥特式建筑，外表看为圆形，实际内部为正六边形。\n圣·沃律仙修道院（L'Abbatiale Saint-Volusien）\n\n这是富瓦这座城市最早的建筑物，虽然屡战屡毁，但是同样见证了富瓦的兴衰。\n此外，富瓦市区本身山清水秀的秀丽景色也吸引着众多的游客。\n\n### 民谣\n\n在法语中，“富瓦”“鹅肝酱”“次数”“信仰”都是同一个发音（接近于拼音“Fuà”），于是便有了下面这首绕口令般的法语民间打油诗：\nIl était une fois，une marchande de foie（曾有一位买鹅肝酱的女商人）\nQui vendait du foie，dans la ville de Foix（在美丽的富瓦城，卖出了一块鹅肝）\nElle se dit ma foi，c'est la première fois（她诚恳地告诉我这是她的第一次）\nEt la dernière fois，que je vends du foie，dans la ville de Foix（也是她在富瓦的最后一次）\n\n## 名人\n\n夏尔·德·弗雷西内（Charles Louis de Saulces de Freycinet）：法国19世纪政治家，4次出任法国总理，在陆军改革方面很有成效。\n亚历山大·雷泽（Alexandre Rauzy）：法国20世纪初期政治家\n埃里克·卡列尔（Eric

华岳山和清平山（现在的五峰山，春川市 北山面 清平里） 因此可以说 高丽时代加平的范围应该扩展到与加平 郡北面接壤的江原道春川市史北面一部分和对面的北山面一带。\n朝鲜\n1413 年 ( 太宗 13) 从江原道划归至京畿道 , 并派遣了作为地方官的县监\n中宗依靠\"中宗反正\"即位后的 1507 年（中宗 2 ），作为国王的胎儿受奉安的地方从县升级为郡，被称为加平郡。\n1697 年 ( 肃宗 23) 降为县， 1707 年又重新升为郡。\n1888 年 ( 高宗 25) 并入江原道 , 1895 年暂时并入京畿道抱川郡， 1 年后独立为加平郡\n1973 年总统令 第 6542 号 (1973. 3. 12 公布 ) 7 月 1 日 行政区域改编 , 加平面升为加平邑\n2004. 12. 1 日行政区域名称更改，外西面改为清平面\n\n## 旅游景点\n\n加平郡著名的文化遗迹有云岳山、舞云瀑布和龙椎瀑布等，人工景点有清平大坝，旅游资源十分丰富，每年到访的游客络绎不绝。\n\n### 云岳山\n\n海拔 935m 的云岳山被定为加平八景中的第六景。云岳山正如其名像穿过云的峰一样，上面奇岩怪石组成了绝景，在山腰还有 悬灯寺和百年瀑布，眼眉石等景点。 上到最顶峰望景台环望四周的话，南边山脊左边很远处一眼可以望见县里的大街，背面可以一眼望见抱川地域。北面可以远 远地望见明智山和华岳山。 云岳山是加平郡所有山中最漂亮的，在登山过程中可以欣赏山和溪谷，还有树林的情趣。另外千年古刹悬灯寺也是可以在静 寂中投入观赏的地方。 在山下的小酒馆里米酒和手工豆腐，橡子果冻，野猕猴桃，山党参等精心烹制好，正等待着客人们的光临。\n\n### 清平湖\n\n清平湖是 1944 年清平大坝竣工后形成的，湖水面积在满水时可以达到 580 万平方米之大。湖水两边的虎鸣山耸立，与清澈的湖水 和谐交融。 清平湖以夏天来此避暑的游客为首，四季来观光的游客络绎不绝 作为利用湖水进行滑水的场所十分出名，每年作为水产业的一环放养 鱼苗，作为钓鱼场所也十分又名。 同时于北汉江相连的清平湖畔景色美丽，作为一日自驾游的场所也是其他地方无法比较的。 清平湖在 1977 年被定为北汉江主干道一部地区的保护水面，又在 1984 年 11 月整个地区解除了保护水面。在被定为保护水面时间 里，在加平郡放流了约 1600 多条鲤鱼幼仔和 100 万条鲫鱼，临近的清平水面研究所也放流了很多鱼。特别是曾在清平湖北边的衣 岩湖，邵阳湖，春川湖，破奴湖等地的大片水面上觅食的鲤鱼，香鱼，鲫鱼，鳜鱼等随着北汉江的流水大量流入并在清平湖开始 生长。 与摩托艇和滑水，游览船航行的主干道相比，在支流钓鱼更加的惬意。在清平湖钓鱼，由于水温较冷水清澈，所以夜间钓鱼比白 天钓鱼更有效果。\n\n### 龙椎瀑布\n\n以海拔 1068 m 的恋人山为发源地而形成的龙坠溪谷，据传是龙飞上天空时画出了九道弯的影子似的景色。作为首都圈里生态 体系没被破环的独一无二的溪谷，这里的水像珍珠一样清澈，与白色石头相配，好像不是水在流，而是石头在流，给人一种 神秘感。 以龙坠溪谷为首，有卧龙湫，抚松岩，一士台，秋月谭，青枫峡，龟游渊， 等九处绝世风景，也称为玉溪九曲。 另外，以恋人山为中心，有通向东北面的北面柏屯里，西北面的下面马日里的登山路线，对于喜爱山行的旅客来说也是一个 不错的去处。 每年 5 月在恋人山都举行恋人山野花节。\n\n## 特产\n\n松子和栗子 松子\n\n## 文化庆典\n\n恋人山杜鹃节（5月中旬/加平郡一带）\n恋人山原本是一个布满荆棘的无名小山，1993年3月5日，加平郡地名委员会将其命名为恋人山（1068米），祝愿所有来登山的人们永远都像恋人一样充满挚爱与真情。节庆期间将举办丰富多彩的庆祝活动，包括统一繁荣丰年祈祷会、戏糨糊、恋人组游戏、食物秀等。"], "selected_questions": ["加平战斗中，哪些国家的军队参与了冲突？", "云岳山是加平郡的什么景点？有哪些特色？", "龙椎瀑布是加平郡的什么景点？有哪些特色和景观？"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["在加平战斗中，中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军以及加拿大和澳洲的军队（属于联合国军）参与了冲突。", "云岳山是加平郡的旅游景点，是加平八景中的第六景。其特色包括海拔高达935米，峰顶奇岩怪石景观壮丽，山腰有悬灯寺和百年瀑布等景点。从山顶望景台可以眺望整个加平郡和抱川地区，可以欣赏山、溪谷和树林的美景。另外，山下的小酒馆提供精心烹制的米酒、手工豆腐、橡子果冻、野猕猴桃和山党参等美食。", "龙椎瀑布是加平郡的景点之一。它位于以恋人山为发源地的龙坠溪谷，据传说是因为龙飞上天空时的影子形成的。龙椎瀑布所在的溪谷水清澈如珍珠，与白色石头相映成趣，给人一种神秘感。整个龙坠溪谷包括卧龙湫、抚松岩、一士台、秋月谭、青枫峡、龟游渊等九处绝景，也被称为玉溪九曲。此外，龙椎瀑布周围的景色非常壮观，是首都圈里生态体系未受破坏的独一无二的溪谷。"], "InternLM_answers": ["加平战斗中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军联合参与了冲突。", "云岳山是加平郡的一个旅游景点，特色包括登山、赏景、寺庙等。", "龙椎瀑布是加平郡的一个著名景点，位于韩国京畿道加平郡北部的春川市。其特色在于其高度为22米，水流落差较大，形成了壮观的瀑布景观。此外，龙椎瀑布还以其清澈的水源和周围的自然风光而著名，是一个非常适合观光和休闲的地方。"], "human_GPT3.5_answers_D_ann": [["<幻觉>矛盾\n<参考>参考1：1951年：加平战斗，中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军与加拿大、澳洲、美国组成的联合国军在此发生武力冲突\n<改正>“中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军以及加拿大和澳洲的军队（属于联合国军）参与了冲突”改为“中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军与加拿大、澳洲、美国组成的联合国军参与了冲突”。"], ["<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考2：海拔 935m 的云岳山被定为加平八景中的第六景", "<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考2：云岳山正如其名像穿过云的峰一样，上面奇岩怪石组成了绝景，在山腰还有 悬灯寺和百年瀑布 参考2：海拔 935m 的云岳山被定为加平八景中的第六景。", "<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考2：海拔 935m 的云岳山被定为加平八景中的第六景<SEP>参考2：上到最顶峰望景台环望四周的话，南边山脊左边很远处一眼可以望见县里的大街，背面可以一眼望见抱川地域<SEP>参考2：在登山过程中可以欣赏山和溪谷，还有树林的情趣", "<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考2：在山下的小酒馆里米酒和手工豆腐，橡子果冻，野猕猴桃，山党参等精心烹制好，正等待着客人们的光临"], ["<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考2：加平郡著名的文化遗迹有云岳山、舞云瀑布和龙椎瀑布等", "<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考2：以海拔 1068 m 的恋人山为发源地而形成的龙坠溪谷，据传是龙飞上天空时画出了九道弯的影子似的景色", "<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考2：这里的水像珍珠一样清澈，与白色石头相配，好像不是水在流，而是石头在流，给人一种神秘感", "<幻觉>矛盾\n<参考>参考2：以龙坠溪谷为首，有卧龙湫，抚松岩，一士台，秋月谭，青枫峡，龟游渊，等九处绝世风景，也称为玉溪九曲\n<改正>“整个龙坠溪谷包括”改为“龙坠溪谷与”。", "<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考2：作为首都圈里生态体系没被破坏的独一无二的溪谷"]], "human_InternLM_answers_ann": [["<幻觉>矛盾\n<参考>参考1：1951年：加平战斗，中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军与加拿大、澳洲、美国组成的联合国军在此发生武力冲突\n<改正>“朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军联合参与了冲突”改为“朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军、加拿大、澳洲和美国的联合国军参与了冲突”。"], ["<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考2：云岳山是加平郡所有山中最漂亮的，可以欣赏山和溪谷，还有树林的情趣。另外千年古刹悬灯寺也是可以在静寂中投入观赏的地方"], ["<幻觉>无法验证\n<参考>参考2：以海拔 1068 m 的恋人山为发源地而形成的龙坠溪谷，据传是龙飞上天空时画出了九道弯的影子似的景色\n<改正>“位于韩国京畿道加平郡北部的春川市”改为“以海拔 1068 m 的恋人山为发源地而形成的龙坠溪谷”。", "<幻觉>无法验证\n<参考>参考2：以海拔 1068 m 的恋人山为发源地而形成的龙坠溪谷，据传是龙飞上天空时画出了九道弯的影子似的景色。作为首都圈里生态 体系没被破环的独一无二的溪谷，这里的水像珍珠一样清澈，与白色石头相配，好像不是水在流，而是石头在流，给人一种 神秘感。以龙坠溪谷为首，有卧龙湫，抚松岩，一士台，秋月谭，青枫峡，龟游渊， 等九处绝世风景，也称为玉溪九曲\n<改正>“其特色在于其高度为22米，水流落差较大，形成了壮观的瀑布景观”改为“据传是龙飞上天空时画出了九道弯的影子似的景色。这里的水像珍珠一样清澈，与白色石头相配，好像不是水在流，而是石头在流，给人一种神秘感”。", "<幻觉>无法验证\n<参考>参考2：以海拔 1068 m 的恋人山为发源地而形成的龙坠溪谷，据传是龙飞上天空时画出了九道弯的影子似的景色。作为首都圈里生态 体系没被破环的独一无二的溪谷，这里的水像珍珠一样清澈，与白色石头相配，好像不是水在流，而是石头在流，给人一种 神秘感。以龙坠溪谷为首，有卧龙湫，抚松岩，一士台，秋月谭，青枫峡，龟游渊， 等九处绝世风景，也称为玉溪九曲\n<改正>“此外，龙椎瀑布还以其清澈的水源和周围的自然风光而著名，是一个非常适合观光和休闲的地方”改为“以龙坠溪谷为首，有卧龙湫，抚松岩，一士台，秋月谭，青枫峡，龟游渊， 等九处绝世风景，也称为玉溪九曲。”。"]], "language": "zh"}

定城\n\n古代旧地名\n\n北齐武平元年省北弋阳入南弋阳，更名定城县，后历为弋阳郡治及光州治，明初废。## 地理环境\n\n北齐时在今河南潢川县置定城县，属定城郡；又置南郢州，定城县为州治，不久定城县省入南、北2弋阳县，以后南、北弋阳合并，复改称定城县。隋朝开皇初年仍置定城县，均为弋阳郡治。唐武德三年（620年）改弋阳郡为光州，以定城县置弦州，贞观元年（627年）州废，县属光州，太极元年（712年）将光州州治复迁至此地，定城遂兼为州治所在地。五代十国时期，十国中的吴、南唐和五代中的后周均在此置光州。北宋时定城县属淮南西路光州，兼为州治。南宋时政区建制及隶属仍依北宋之制。元朝时定城县属汝宁府光州，兼为州治。明初废定城县省入光州，以州代县，州管实土。\n\n## 历史沿革\n\n### 前身为弋阳郡治弋阳县\n\n南北朝时期，战争频繁，建置不一，弋地归属多变。宋武帝永初三年(422年)，弋阳郡属宋地，仍辖弋阳、期思、安丰3县，隶豫州。文帝元嘉二十五年（448年），以豫部蛮民居地立茹由、乐安、光城、雩娄、边城、史水、开化7县，均隶属弋阳郡，时置弋阳太守。孝武帝大明元年（457年），分弋阳郡立光城左郡。八年(464年)省光城左郡为县，仍隶弋阳郡。齐高帝建元元年（479年）弋地归齐，弋阳郡领弋阳、期思、南新息、上蔡、平舆5县，隶豫州。明帝建武三年(496年)，弋阳太守投降北魏，弋阳郡改属北魏，时仅领弋阳1县。梁简文帝大宝元年(550年)，高洋代东魏自立，国号齐，弋地改属北齐。\n\n### 改弋阳县为定城县即弋阳郡治定此城\n\n北齐文宣谓:“百室之名，便立州邑，三户之名，空张郡目。”当时在今潢川南城新置弋阳郡，与原弋阳郡南北相望，出现南北弋阳。《中国历史地图集》第四册59页-60页图示，弋阳郡、潢川同为一处，此前历代弋阳郡址均图标在潢川之西北处黄国故城。武平元年（570年），省北弋阳入南弋阳，更名定城，即弋阳郡治定此城。历为都城、郡治的北弋阳易名隆古，颇有兴隆古城之意。旋即，省并州郡，改弋阳郡为南郢州，领属与北魏同。陈宜帝太建十一年（579年），北周静帝攻占定城，改弋阳郡为淮南郡，省定城为郡治。\n\n### 唐改弋阳郡为光州后不久复为光州州治\n\n隋文帝开皇元年(581年)，废淮南郡，复定城县，仍为弋阳郡治，郡统定城、光山、殷城、固始、期思、乐安6县，隶扬州。唐承隋业，置州县犹多。高祖武德三年(620年)，改弋阳郡为光州，治光山；以定城为弦州，置总管府(未几罢之)，领定城县。太宗贞观元年(627年)，废弦州，复定城，隶光州。睿宗太极元年(712年)，光州州城复迁至定城县治弋阳城；州辖定城（弋阳）、光山、固始、仙居、殷城5县，隶淮南道。玄宗天宝元年(742年)，改光州为弋阳郡；肃宗乾元元年(758年)，复为光州，隶淮南道。五代十国期间：梁太祖开平元年(907年)光州归后梁，干化二年(912年)属吴国，后晋高祖天福二年(937年)隶南唐，后周世宗显德五年(958年)入后周；沿袭唐制，辖隶依故。\n\n### 唐宋元均为光州治\n\n宋代，太宗至道三年(997年)，改道为路，光州隶淮南西路，治定城县，领定城、固始、光山、仙居4县。徽宗宣和元年(1119年)，升光州为光山军，治定城县，领属不变。宋高宗绍兴二十八年(1158年)，为避金太子光瑛讳，改光州为蒋州；三十一年乞复其旧。宁宗庆元元年(1195年)。建州城为南北两城。南城为县治、北城为州治。理宗嘉熙元年(1237年)，兵乱徙治金刚台；度宗咸淳四年(1268年)，台毁于战，治返光州。\n\n元代，世祖至元十年(1273年)，置光州招讨司，十二年属蕲黄宜慰司；二十三年归淮西宣慰司。三十年隶汝宁府，领定城、光山、固始3县，属河南行省辖地。\n\n### 明初废定城县改为光州\n\n明代，太祖洪武元年(1368年)，废定城县入光州，以州代县，州管实土。此后再无定城县称谓，定城县域范围即属光州疆域范围，南北城统称光州城，光州为散州属汝宁府。\n清代初沿明制，光州依属汝宁府，清雍正二年(1724年)，诏升光州为直隶州，直隶河南布政使司，辖4县。\n民国初，废州设道尹。1913年3月1日，国务院批准改光州为潢川县。"],

{"name": "智利", "documents": ["智利共和国（西班牙语：República de Chile，英语：Republic of Chile），简称“智利”，位于南美洲西南部，安第斯山脉西麓。东同阿根廷为邻，北与秘鲁、玻利维亚接壤，西临太平洋，南与南极洲隔海相望，是世界上地形最狭长的国家，国土面积756715平方公里，智利共分为16个大区（Región），下设54个省（Provincia）和346个市（Comuna），首都圣地亚哥。2022年9月智利全国总人口1945.8万，其中城市人口占86.9％。\n智利原为阿劳干人、马普切人、火地人等印第安人居住地，\n16世纪初以前属印加帝国。1535年西班牙人开始入侵，1541年起沦为西班牙殖民地。\n1810年9月18日成立执政委员会，实行自治。此后，智利人民在贝尔纳多·奥希金斯的率领下开展反抗西班牙殖民统治的斗争。1817年２月同阿根廷联军击败西班牙殖民军。1818年宣告独立。1973年军政府上台，1990年恢复代议制民主。\n\n智利是拉美经济较发达的国家之一。矿业、林业、渔业和农业是国民经济四大支柱。近年来，受新冠肺炎疫情、国际经济复苏乏力、本国经济结构性问题影响，智利经济发展面临一定挑战，智利央行预计2022年智利经济增长1.5%。2021年国内生产总值3168亿美元，人均国内生产总值16503美元，外贸总额1796亿美元。\n\n## 历史沿革\n\n### 独立前\n\n智利原有居民是印第安人，16世纪处于从母系氏族向父系氏族过渡阶段。其中，北部的乌鲁人、孔萨人和中部的阿劳坎人主要从事农业生产，兼营渔业，有的已能制造铜器和金银器；南部的奥纳人、雅甘人等靠渔猎为生。16世纪30年代，西班牙殖民者弗朗西斯科·皮萨罗征服秘鲁以后，派他的伙伴阿尔马格罗于1535年侵入智利。因遭印第安人袭击，1538年逃回秘鲁。1540年，皮萨罗又派巴尔迪维亚再次侵入智利，陆续建立圣地亚哥、康塞普西翁和瓦尔迪维亚等城镇，智利遂沦为西班牙殖民地。此后，印第安人继续坚持战斗，其中间劳坎人长期控制着比奥比奥河以南的领土，智利初由秘鲁总督管辖，1778年西班牙王室设置智利都督府和检审庭，作为智利的最高统治机构。殖民统治时期，智利经济以农业为主，生产小麦、玉米：畜牧业也占有重要地位。西班牙殖民者侵占大片土地，推行委托监护制，强迫印第安人从事农业劳动或采掘贵重金属。他们使用各种手段搜刮财富，给当地人民造成严重灾难。智利人民曾在1651、1655、1723、1766、1780年多次举行起义。\n1810年9月18日，圣地亚哥的土生白人推翻了殖民政权，成立独立政府。1814年10月秘鲁总督派兵前来恢复殖民统治。智利民族志士在奥希金斯领导下越过安第斯山，与圣马丁的军队会合。1817年，这支军队在圣马丁指挥下进军智利，2月12日在查卡布科大败西班牙殖民军。同年，奥希金斯被推举为智利最高执政官。1818年2月12日奥希金斯正式宣布智利独立，成立共和国。\n\n### 独立后\n\n智利独立后，政权为土生白人地主所掌握。奥希主斯政府采取了一些进步措施，如取消贵族爵位，允许传布新教，发展公立学校，鼓励对外贸易等。引起地主阶级和天主教会不满。1823年奥希金斯被迫辞职，流亡秘鲁。此后，由于不同政治派别之间的斗争，国家一度陷于动乱。1831年保守党上台执政。1833年制定宪法，赋予总统以极大权力，以天主教为国教，巩固了大地主阶级的统治，开始了此后30年比较稳定的政治局面。\n在这期间，保守党政府鼓励来自欧洲各国的移民，侵占印第安人的土地。开发阿塔卡马和科金博铜矿，使智利成为世界重要的产铜国。矿产和粮食的出口增加，教育也有所发展。与此同时，大量英美资本投入硝石、铜矿开采业以及铁路。1836～1839年间，智利进行了反对玻利维亚一秘鲁联邦的战争（桑塔·克鲁斯，A）。\n19世纪40～50年代，自由党在自由派地主和矿业资本家支持下强大起来。1861～1891年自由党执政期间。政府极力削弱天主教势力，开发阿塔卡马沙漠的硝石区。并改进了交通。英美资本进一步侵入，控制了铁路和主要生产部门。1865～1866年，智利与秘鲁、厄瓜多尔和玻利维亚结成同盟，进行了反对西班牙的战争。在南美太平洋战争中，智利吞并了秘鲁的塔拉帕卡省和阿里卡省以及玻利维亚的安托法加斯塔地区。\n\n### 国会共和时期\n\n1891年，海军军官J.蒙特发动内战，夺取政权。此后，地主阶级联合大进出口商通过国会控制政府，开始了所谓“国会共和时期”（1891～1920）。这个时期，智利经济有所发展。1920年，自由联盟候选人A.亚历山德里·帕尔马当选为总统。1925年，召开制宪会议，制定新宪法，规定选民直接选举总统，实行政教分离，征收累进税，政府有权征用私人财产。工人运动日益发展。1922年社会劳工党改名为共产党，并加入共产国际。1932年亚历山德里·帕尔马再次当选总统后，反民主倾向加剧，法西斯势力日益猖獗。1936年，激进党、共产党、社会党、民主党和劳工联盟组成人民阵线。激进党在人民阵线支持下执政，塞尔达（1938～1942）、里奥斯·莫拉莱斯（1942～1946）和加夫列尔·冈萨雷斯·魏地拉（1946～1952）相继任总统。前两届政府曾大力兴办学校，成立“生产开发公司”，发展民族工业，向农民贷款，发展对外贸易，与此同时，无产阶级更加壮大。1941年国会选举时，有18名工人代表被选入国会。\n第二次世界大战前期，智利保持中立。1945年对轴心国宣战。冈萨雷斯·魏地拉执政初期，曾吸收左翼人士入阁。1947年起，政策右转，1948年颁布《保卫民主法》。1952年，卡洛斯·伊瓦涅斯·德尔·坎波当选总统后，继续在外交上追随美国。\n1958年，自由党和保守党支持豪尔赫·亚历山德里·罗德里格斯当选总统。1960年，智利发生8.9级特大地震，给智利造成毁灭性的伤害。1964年，基督教民主党领袖爱德华多·弗雷·蒙塔尔瓦当选总统后，迫于人民的压力，曾对美资铜矿公司实行“智利化”（即合营）；同时征收地主的部分土地分配给农民。\n\n### 军人执政时期\n\n1970年，左翼6个党组成人民团结阵线，支持社会党人阿连德·戈森斯当选总统。执政期间实行了一系列激进的经济和社会改革。1973年9月11日军人发动政变，推翻了阿连德政府。陆军司令奥古斯托·皮诺切特任“军人执政委员会”主席。进行了长达16年的军政府统治。1989年，智利举行差额选举的总统大选，帕特里西奥·艾尔文·阿索卡尔获胜，于次年接替皮诺切特出任总统。\n\n### 发展新阶段\n\n1994至2000年间基督教民主党人爱德华多·弗雷当选总统。2000年起社会民主党人里卡多·拉戈斯·埃斯科瓦尔当选总统。2006年1月15日，前国防部长、单亲妈妈米歇尔·巴切莱特在选举中获胜，当选该国历史上第一位女总统。\n2010年1月11日，智利正式签署加入经济合作与发展组织的协定，使其成为该组织第31个成员国，也是南美洲首个加入该组织的国家。\n2010年1月17日，智利反对派联盟“争取变革联盟”候选人塞巴斯蒂安·皮涅拉以52%的得票率当选智利总统，成为智利52年来首位通过投票当选总统的右翼党派总统。\n\n2017年12月17日晚，智利选举服务局宣布，根据对总统选举第二轮投票99.62%选票的统计，前总统塞瓦斯蒂安·皮涅拉获得54.57%的选票，当选下任智利总统。\n此次选举是自1990年智利军政府“还政于民”以来举行的第七次总统选举。新总统于2018年3月11日就职。\n\n2022年10月11日，当选为联合国人权理事会新成员，于2023年1月1日就任。\n\n## 地理环境\n\n### 区域位置\n\n智利位于南美洲西南部，安第斯山脉西麓。南纬18度与57度，西经81.5度~68.5度之间。东同阿根廷为邻，北与秘鲁、玻利维亚接壤，西临太平洋，南与南极洲隔海相望。\n海岸线总长约1万公里，南北长4352公里，东西最窄96.8公里、最宽362.3公里，是世界上地形最狭长的国家。智利国土面积756715平方公里（其中陆地面积756253平方公里，岛屿面积373平方公里），在南美国家中居第七位。\n南美洲的智利，它像一支又瘦又长的毛笔，从北到南长达4270公里。如果把它放在中国地图中，就要从黑龙江省最北部一直伸到西沙群岛。而国土东西之间的宽度平均只有180公里，不过相当于上海到杭州的距离，仅为国土长度的二十四分之一，堪称世界上领土最狭长的国家。\n\n### 地形地貌\n\n智利东为安第斯山脉的西坡，约占全境东西宽度的1/3；西为海拔300～2000米的海岸山脉，大部分地带沿海岸伸展，向南入海，形成众多的沿海岛屿；中部是由冲积物所填充的陷落谷地，海拔1200米左右。境内多火山，地震频繁。位于智利、阿根廷边境上的奥霍斯－德尔萨拉多峰海拔6885米，为全国最高点。全国有河流30余条，较重要的有比奥比奥河等。主要岛屿有火地岛、奇洛埃岛、惠灵顿岛等。\n大致上智利可分三个区域：\n北部多山，许多山峰在6000米以上。在安第斯山脉的两条山脊之间是阿塔卡马沙漠。这是地球上最干燥的地方，往往终年无雨。过去这里有硝酸矿被开发，当今是铜矿开采。这个地区较大的城市是安托法加斯塔（219000居民）及伊基克。\n中部气候类似地中海气候。这个区域土地非常肥沃，人口众多。首都圣地亚哥（约五百万居民）就在这里。除此之外还有瓦尔帕莱索（港口，280000居民）和康塞普西翁（工农业中心，350000居民）是重要城市。智利阿塔卡马沙漠附近的塔拉尔盐湖南部人烟稀少，降雨极丰富。海岸前有许多岛屿。大陆南方有火地岛，智利和阿根廷各占一半。火地岛前的一个岛上的合恩角是智利和南美洲的最南点。\n从西向东首先是一条狭窄的海岸，然后是山脉，然后是比较宽的高原。在中部这个高原很肥沃，可以被用作耕地和牧场。智利和玻利维亚和阿根廷的边界线是安第斯山脉的东山脊。\n除此之外太平洋中的胡安·费尔南德斯群岛和复活节岛也属智利。\n\n### 气候特征\n\n由于国土横跨38个纬度，而且各地区地理条件不一，智利的气候复杂多样包括多种形态，使得很难用一句话总结智利全国的气候状况。气候可分为北、中、南三个明显不同的地段：北段主要是沙漠气候；中段是冬季多雨、夏季干燥的亚热带地中海型气候；南为多雨的温带阔叶林气候。按照柯本气候分类法，在智利国境内至少包括了七种主要的气候亚类型，包括有北部的沙漠到东部和东南部的高山苔原和冰川，复活节岛上的湿润亚热带性气候，智利南部的海洋性气候以及智利中部的地中海气候。全国大多数地区有四个季节：夏季（12月至2月），秋季（3月至5月），冬季（6月至8月）和春季（9月至11月）。\n\n### 自然灾难\n\n世界上最干燥的地区之一，智利的阿塔卡马（Atacama）沙漠于2015年4月1日，遭遇一场罕见猛烈暴风雨的袭击。暴风雨引发的洪水已致24人遇难，140人失踪。洪水以迅雷不及掩耳之势，横扫山谷，掩埋山庄，摧毁建筑，将摩托车裹挟着带出好几千米。根据路透社消息，智利总统米歇尔·巴切莱特（Michelle Bachelet）称需耗费15亿美元（约合人民币93亿）来修复洪水和塌方所造成的损失\n\n1960年5月22日，智利南部瓦尔迪维亚发生9.5级地震，是有科学记录以来震级最高的地震。地震引发海啸，波及菲律宾东部沿海。地震和海啸约造成2000人死亡，200万人受灾。\n\n2020年5月22日，智利各界举办不同形式的活动，纪念瓦尔迪维亚9.5级大地震60周年。\n\n## 自然资源\n\n智利有着富饶的矿产资源，特别是硝石和铜矿曾先后在智利经济发展史上占有重要地位。16世纪智利发现金矿，17世纪发现银矿，18世纪发现铜矿，此后智利矿业不仅在拉美，甚至在世界上也都占有重要地位。\n铜矿业是智利经济的重要支柱。2011年智利铜的储量达1.5亿吨左右，占世界储量的近30%，排名第一位，大大超过排名其后的秘鲁（12%）、墨西哥（7%）、美国（7%）和中国（6%）。其中，智利国家铜公司拥有的储量约为10%。铜的生产占世界产量的三分之一，2010年产量达到540万吨，远远超过秘鲁、美国、中国、俄罗斯和澳大利亚，这些国家产量占世界产量比重都不足10%。\n智利的铜资源绝大多数集中在中、北部的斑岩型铜—钼—金矿化带中，走向南北延续2000多公里，北起安第斯高原山脉向南延伸到中部圣地亚哥以南的海岸山脉，再向东延伸到接近阿根廷边界。矿带相当于智利领土长度的二分之一，位于秘鲁—智利—阿根廷安第斯斑岩铜矿带。智利共有矿床400多个，其中大型和超大型矿床10多个，如世界驰名的丘基卡马塔（Chuquicamata）矿、厄尔特尼思特（El Teniente）矿、厄尔萨尔瓦多（El Salvador）矿、安迪纳（Andian）矿、埃斯贡地达（Escondida）矿、洛斯布隆塞斯（Los Bronces）矿等。矿床覆盖岩层较薄，水文地质条件好，易采易选。矿石含铜量较高，铜品位在0.55~5%之间，平均品位为0.94%。\n智利硝石储量，智利是世界上唯一生产天然硝石的国家，主要产在北方的阿塔卡马沙漠地区。自从发现硝石，这块荒漠就成为智利历史上最富庶的地区。智利的硝石矿分布区域十分广阔，在沿海高原后面，秘鲁边界与安托法加斯塔省之间，硝石矿带长750多公里，宽25~30公里。在离地面0.5~2米的地下，埋藏着1~3米厚的硝石层。硝石是提炼氮、钾、钠、硫等肥料及碘元素的天然原料，也是军事工业必不可少的原料。此外，在炼铜时加入一定比例的硝石可以使铜的纯度提高。\n根据智利古斯塔夫·拉戈斯天主教大学矿业中心2012年的研究报告，世界已探明锂矿储量在400万吨至3000万吨之间，而总储量在800万吨至5600万吨之间，而智利储量约占世界总量17.8%。2011年澳大利亚才取代智利成为锂矿产量最大的国家（产量6.2万吨）。智利退居世界第二位，产量为5.9万吨，占世界总产量37%。\n智利锂矿藏主要集中在北部的塔拉帕卡, 安托法加斯塔和阿塔卡马等大区，共有约60个盐湖和咸水湖。Atacama盐湖面积2800平方公里，是世界上知名的最大盐湖，估计储量为4000万公吨，其余6600平方公里的盐湖面积从0.5平方公里至253平方公里不等，这些盐湖大部分没有进行系统的勘探。\n\n智利还是第一大铼生产国，第三大钼生产国，第七大银生产国和第十四大金生产国，随着一个投资90亿美元的金矿投产，智利很快将跻身十大产金国之列；在非金属矿产方面，智利在碘的生产中排名世界第一。\n\n除上述矿产外，智利还有铁、煤、铅、锌、锰、水银和石油等矿藏。尤其是铁矿石，其品位很高（含铁量在60%以上），可以跟瑞典铁矿石媲美。\n\n## 行政区划\n\n### 区划\n\n智利共分为16个大区（Región），下设54个省（Provincia）和346个市（Comuna）。大区主席和省长由总统任命，市长由直接选举产生，任期4年，可连任。各大区名称如下：阿里卡和帕里塔戈塔（第十五大区）、帕拉帕卡（第一大区）、安托法加斯塔（第二大区）、阿塔卡马（第三大区）、科金博（第四大区）、瓦尔帕莱索（第五大区）、解放者奥希金斯将军（第六大区）、马乌莱（第七大区）、比奥比奥（第八大区）、阿劳卡尼亚（第九大区）、洛斯·理约斯（第十四大区）、洛斯·拉格斯（第十大区）、伊瓦涅斯将军的艾森（第十一大区）、麦哲伦（第十二大区）、圣地亚哥首都大区。\n\n### 主要城市\n\n圣地亚哥\n圣地亚哥·德·智利（西班牙语：Santiago de Chile），是智利共和国的首都和最大城市，人口685.69万，南美洲第五大城市。位于国境中部，坐落在马波乔河畔，东依安第斯山，西距瓦尔帕来索港约100公里。夏季干燥温和，冬季凉爽多雨雾，碧波粼粼的马波乔河从城边缓缓流过，终年积雪的安第斯山仿佛一顶闪闪发光的银冠，天然山水给增添了动人的风韵。圣地亚哥市所在的地区夏季（10月至次年3月）气温并不太热，最热的1月份平均温度是20℃左右；冬天也不太冷，最冷的7月份平均温度也有8℃左右。\n圣地亚哥是一个由多个市镇构成的城市，虽均属圣地亚哥首都大区管辖，严格上并没有一个统一的市政机构；大部分市镇位于圣地亚哥省境内，其中最核心的市镇亦称为“圣地亚哥”。圣地亚哥虽是智利首都，但智利国会却设于该市以西120公里的海滨城市瓦尔帕莱索。圣地亚哥是智利工业与金融中心，城市贡献了智利全国45%的GDP。\n瓦尔帕莱索\n南美洲太平洋东岸重要海港，智利阿空加瓜区（第五大区）和瓦尔帕莱索省首府。位于瓦尔帕莱索湾南岸，东南距圣地亚哥约130公里。人口80.3万（2010）。始建于1536年。屡遭海盗、风暴、大火、地震毁坏，现市区大多为1906年地震后重建；港湾开阔，筑有坚固的防波堤以及现代化的港口设施。智利最大贸易港，其中输入占全国进口总值的半数以上。工业约占全国五分之一，有纺织、金属加工、化工、炼油、制糖、服装、制革、油漆等。气候宜人，风景秀丽，为旅游胜地。有多所大学和博物馆。\n横贯安第斯山国际铁路的西部终端站，与首都电气火车相通。城市居民多为欧洲移民尤其是英德法意移民的后裔，城市同时也是智利国民议会、智利文化部和智利海军司令部的所在地。\n康塞普西翁\n康赛普西翁是智利比奥比奥大区的首府，大康赛普西翁地区的中心。始建于1550年。屡遭地震、海啸破坏，屡迁城址，1754年迁现址。周围农产丰富，水力资源充足。附近产煤，煤矿占全国的90%以上，为国家重要工商业中心之一。农业发达，是葡萄酒和谷物的贸易中心。工业有纺织、面粉、制革、玻璃、陶瓷、制糖、钢铁、造纸、炼油等。有铁路通圣地亚哥。设有康塞普西翁大学。交通十分便利。\n\n## 国家象征\n\n### 国名\n\n智利共和国（英语：The Republic of Chile；西班牙语：República de Chile）简称智利。\n\n### 国旗\n\n智利国旗启用于1817年10月18日，国旗呈长方形，长宽之比为3:2。旗面由蓝、白、红三色组成。上半部左角为蓝色正方形，其中央绘有一颗白色五角星。右侧为白色长方形。下半部为红色长方形。白色部分等于红色部分的2/3。红色象征为了智利的独立和自由，为了反抗西班牙殖民军的统治，在兰卡瓜英勇牺牲的烈士鲜血。白色象征安第斯山高峰的白雪。蓝色象征海洋。智利国旗是在独立之初，以美国星条旗为本而设计的。红色代表为脱离西班牙而流的鲜血。蓝色代表智利的天空与海洋颜色，正方形据说是取自印第安徽章。白色是安地斯山的雪。星星指南天光辉的星星，表示国家统一。\n\n### 国徽\n\n智利国徽为五角星象征光明照耀前进的道路。顶端蓝、白、红三根鸵鸟羽毛代表特有的美洲鸵鸟；左侧是安第斯山地区特有的棕鹿；右侧是安第斯山秃鹰；底部的戈比爱野百合花象征人民争取独立自由的民族精神；白色饰带上为1810年反抗西班牙殖民统治的斗争口号：“依靠公理和武力”。\n\n### 国树\n\n阿劳乌卡利亚松是世界稀有树种，有“黑色金字塔”之称。别名有诺福克南洋杉、小叶南洋杉。树形端正，有树脂，树干通直。树皮略灰色，裂成薄片状。树冠塔形。大桂平伸，长达15米；小枝干展或下垂；侧校常成羽状排列，下垂。叶二型。\n\n### 国花\n\n智利国花是“科皮乌埃”（COPIUE），又名“红铃兰”。该花是一种野生百合花，花期长达8个月，花朵多为红色，还有蓝色和白色的。此花在智中、南部地区随处可见，深受智利人的喜爱。传说，此花以前只有蓝色白色两种，智土著人阿拉乌干人为反对西班牙殖民者的统治和压迫揭竿而起，同殖民军进行了英勇的斗争，后来起义的几万名将士全部战死疆场，起义失败的第二年春天鲜红的科皮乌埃花开遍了英雄们战死的战场，智利人就视此花为英雄们的英灵，从而将此花作为智国花。\n\n### 国鸟\n\n智利国鸟为“孔多尔”（CONDOR），是一种安第斯山秃鹰，它长年栖息在海拔数千米的安第斯山脉，属食肉鹰鹫猛禽类。它体大、凶猛，多呈深灰色，飞行高而快，寿命也长。智利国徽、军徽上都有它的图案，作为智捍卫祖国的力量、勇气和决心。\n\n### 国歌\n\n《亲爱的祖国》。\n歌词大意：流血的斗争已经平静，昨天的暴君成了弟兄；过去遭受的奴役和凌辱，已经在战场上洗清。长期遭受重重迫害的奴隶，今天享受自由和胜利，自由是勇士们留下的遗产，它使被奴役的人们获得权力。\n\n## 人口民族\n\n### 人口\n\n智利全国总人口1949万，其中城市人口占86.9％。白人和印欧混血种人约占89%，印第安人约占11%。官方语言为西班牙语。在印第安人聚居区使用马普切语。15岁以上人口中信仰天主教的占67%，信仰福音教的占15%。\n\n### 民族\n\n白人和印欧混血种人约占89%，印第安人约占11%。\n南部阿劳卡尼亚大区印第安人比较集中。\n大约19世纪上半叶华人到达智利，华人华侨人数一直较少，在当地影响较小。在智利华人华侨中，老华侨一半经营中餐馆，新华侨以从事进出口贸易、零售业为主，有少部分华侨在当地企业工作。\n\n## 政治\n\n### 政体\n\n智利实行单一总统制，自军人“还政于民”以来，智政局保持稳定。中左政党联盟连续执政20年，历经四届政府。2010年1月，中右翼联盟总统候选人皮涅拉在大选第二轮投票中当选总统，于2010年3月11日就职，任期4年。因2010年2月27日智中南部地区发生特大地震，皮就职后重点开展灾后重建工作，同时加大对民生的投入。2011年以来，频繁发生游行示威活动，要求改革政治、教育、财税制度，皮涅拉民意支持率下挫。2012年10月，中右翼执政联盟在市政选举中失利。2017年12月，中右翼联盟“智利前进”候选人、前总统皮涅拉赢得大选，于2018年3月就职。皮上任后，积极推进政治民主改革，出台提振经济举措，实行多元、务实的对外政策。智经济社会形势总体保持稳定。\n\n### 宪法\n\n现行宪法于1981年3月11日生效，后经过1989年、1991年、1993年、2005年四次修改。宪法规定，总统是国家元首和政府首脑。2005年修宪将总统任期改为4年，并取消了终身参议员和指定参议员。2020年10月，智利制宪公投以压倒性优势获得通过，2021年5月，制宪大会代表选举顺利举行。7月，制宪大会正式组建并召开首次会议。2022年7月，制宪大会提交新宪法草案。9月，新宪法草案在公投中未获通过。12月，朝野各方经长时间协商就重启制宪进程达成一致。\n\n### 议会\n\n国民议会（Congreso Nacional）实行参、众两院制。议会由直接选举的50名参议员、155名众议员组成。参议员任期8年，每四年改选其中1/2；众议员任期4年。1973年军事政变后议会被解散，1990年3月11日恢复。现任参议长为阿尔瓦罗·埃利萨尔德（Alvaro Elizalde），众议长为弗拉多·米洛舍维奇（Vlado Mirosevic），于2022年11月当选。主要党派在议会中所占席位如下：\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 参议院 | 众议院 |\n| 智利我们行 | 24 | 53 |\n| 新社会契约 | 18 | 37 |\n| 尊严制宪 | 5 | 37 |\n| 基督教社会阵线 | 1 | 15 |\n| 人民党 | 0 | 6 |\n| 此刻的尊严 | 0 | 3 |\n| 绿色生态党 | 0 | 2 |\n| 其它 | 2 | 2 |\n| 总计 | 50 | 155 |\n\n### 政府\n\n智利本届政府于2022年3月11日组成，共设24个部委。主要成员有：内政部长卡罗琳娜·托阿（Carolina Tohá），外交部长阿尔韦托·范克拉韦伦（Alberto van Klaveren），国防部长玛雅·费尔南德斯（Maya Fernández），财政部长马里奥·马塞尔（Mario Marcel），政府秘书部部长卡米拉·巴利霍（Camila Vallejo），经济部长尼古拉斯·格劳（Nicolás Grau）。\n\n### 司法\n\n智利司法独立。全国设最高法院、17个上诉法院和1个军事法庭。最高法院院长胡安·爱德华多·富恩特斯·贝尔马尔（Juan Eduardo Fuentes Belmar），2022年1月6日任职。1999年成立检察院，国家检察长暂时空缺，国家检察长为安赫尔·巴伦西亚（Ángel Valencia）。\n\n### 政党\n\n智利实行多党制，主要政党分为新兴左翼、中左翼和中右翼三大阵营。\n1、新兴左翼执政联盟“尊严制宪”（Apruebo Dignidad, AD）：由新兴左翼联盟“广泛阵线”和左翼联盟“尊严智利”组成，2020年，两大联盟宣布结盟参加2021年地方和制宪大会代表选举，并于2021年7月推选博里奇作为联盟唯一候选人参加大选。\n（1）广泛阵线（Frente Amplio，FA）：成立于2017年。现由社会融合党、民主革命党、团结运动等5个左翼政党和社会运动组成，主张社会公平，消除贫富分化，改善公共服务和战略行业国有化。\n（2）尊严智利（Chile Digno,CD）：成立于2017年。由智利共产党、地区主义社会绿党和人道主义行动党等组成。智利共产党（Partido Comunista，PC）成立于1912年。党员4.7万人。原名社会主义工人党，1922年改为现名。1970—1973年与社会党等联合执政。1979年提出“人民造反”路线，要求立即结束军政权。1983年同社会党阿尔梅达派等组成“人民民主运动”。1985年被宪法法庭宣布为非法。1990年10月恢复合法地位。2010年首次进入国会。现任党主席吉列尔莫·泰列尔（Guillermo

对外关系\n\n同中国的关系\n中智于1970年12月15日建交。智利是第一个同中国建交的南美洲国家。建交50多年来，两国关系发展顺利。双方高层交往频繁，在国际多边领域保持良好合作。智政府坚定奉行一个中国原则。\n\n2014年3月10日至13日，交通运输部部长杨传堂作为国家主席习近平特使出访智利，出席智利总统权力交接仪式。期间，杨传堂会见了智利卸任总统皮涅拉、新任总统巴切莱特。\n\n2014年7月16日，国家主席习近平在出席金砖国家同南美国家领导人对话会期间，在巴西利亚会见智利总统巴切莱特。\n\n2016年11月22日至23日，应智利共和国总统米歇尔·巴切莱特·赫里亚邀请，国家主席习近平对智利进行国事访问，双方共同发表了《中华人民共和国和智利共和国关于建立全面战略伙伴关系的联合声明》。\n\n两国签有贸易、科技、文化、互免外交和公务签证、投资保护、文物保护、检验检疫、民航运输等协议。2018年11月，中智签署《中华人民共和国政府与智利共和国政府关于共同推进丝绸之路经济带和21世纪海上丝绸之路建设的谅解备忘录》。1988年，两国建立外交部间政治磋商制度，迄今已举行15次磋商。2005年，两国建立中智议会政治对话委员会，并于2006年举行第一次会议，迄今已举行13次会议。2017年4月，中智政府间常设委员会举行第一次会议。目前，两国有17对友好省市关系。中国在智利伊基克设有总领事馆，智利在沪、穗、蓉、港设有总领事馆。\n\n中智经贸合作发展顺利。智利是第一个就中国加入世界贸易组织与中国签署双边协议、承认中国完全市场经济地位、同中国签署双边自由贸易协定、同中国签署自贸协定升级议定书的拉美国家。两国建有政府间经贸混委会，迄今已举行20次会议。两国建有经济合作与协调战略对话机制，迄今已举行4次会议。近年来，双边经贸关系保持快速增长势头。据中国海关统计，2022年，双边贸易额670亿美元，其中出口225亿美元，进口444美元，同比分别增长1.8%、-14.2%、12.4%。2023年1至3月，双边贸易额179亿美元，其中出口46亿美元，进口132亿美元，同比分别增长-1.5%、-17.6%和5.7%。目前，中国是智利全球第一大贸易伙伴、第一大出口目的地国和第一大进口来源国，智利是中国在拉美第三大贸易伙伴和进口铜的最大来源国。中国人民银行与智利央行签有关于人民币清算安排的谅解备忘录和本币互换协议。2016年6月，中国建设银行智利分行作为拉美首家人民币清算行正式开业。智利银行、智利信贷和投资银行在华设有办事处。2017年5月，中国证监会同智利保险监管机构签署资本市场信息交流合作谅解备忘录。2021年7月，智利正式加入亚洲基础设施投资银行。10月，中国与智利海关“经认证的经营者”(AEO)互认安排正式实施，智利成为南美洲第一个与中国实施海关AEO互认安排的国家。\n\n中方对智主要出口机电产品、纺织品、钢材、家电等，从智主要进口铜、铁矿砂、纸浆、鱼粉、水果、葡萄酒等。\n\n中智签有文化和科技合作协定。两国文化交流始于上世纪50年代。中国国家汉办同智利圣托马斯大学、天主教大学和边境大学在智利建有3所孔子学院。2014年5月，孔子学院拉丁美洲中心在智利首都圣地亚哥成立。2016年11月，双方签署在智设立中国文化中心的谅解备忘录。两国建有政府间科技混委会，迄今已举行10次会议。多年来，智方为中方在南极开展科考工作予以协助。2015年12月，外交部部长助理孔铉佑率团视察智费雷站等4国南极科考站。2017年1月，全国政协副主席、科技部部长万钢访智。双方在地震和天文领域的交流与合作进展顺利。2013年10月，中国首个海外天文研究机构——中国科学院南美天文研究中心暨中智天文联合研究中心在智成立。2015年7月，中智便利两国人员往来签证安排正式实施。9月，中智天文大数据中心正式揭牌。2016年11月，双方签署在智联合建设和运行天文观测基地的谅解备忘录。智利为中国公民出境旅游目的地国。据智利官方统计，2020年赴智中国游客数量为5798人。\n\n同拉美和加勒比国家关系\n智政府强调立足拉美，优先巩固和加强同拉美国家，特别是周边邻国的关系。重视地区国家间的政治磋商与协调以及经贸技术合作，积极推动地区一体化，维护地区民主与和平。近年来，主办第6届和第17届伊比利亚美洲首脑会议、第2届美洲国家首脑会议、第33届美洲国家组织大会及2008年南美国家联盟首脑特别峰会等。2011年4月，与秘鲁、哥伦比亚、墨西哥宣布成立拉美“太平洋联盟”，以推动实现沿太平洋国家经贸合作和一体化。2011年12月，拉美和加勒比国家共同体成立，智利担任首任轮值主席国，任期1年。2012年6月和9月，智先后成功举办拉美太平洋联盟第4届峰会和拉美和加勒比国家共同体外长会。2016年7月，智举办第11届拉美太平洋联盟首脑峰会，并接任轮值主席国，任期1年。2018年1月，在圣地亚哥举办中拉论坛第二届部长级会议。2019年，智利、哥伦比亚提议建立南美进步论坛，并于3月在圣地亚哥举行南美进步论坛首次峰会。2020年12月，智利主办太平洋联盟和南美进步论坛线上峰会。2022年4月，智利正式宣布中止在南美进步论坛的活动；同月，博里奇总统对阿根廷进行国事访问。8月，博里奇总统出席哥伦比亚新任总统佩特罗就职仪式。2023年1月，博里奇总统出席在阿根廷举行的拉美和加勒比国家共同体第7届峰会。2023年3月，博里奇总统出席在多米尼加举行的第28届伊比利亚美洲国家首脑会议。4月，阿根廷总统费尔南德斯访智。\n\n同美国的关系\n智美1823年建交。美国一直是智最主要的经贸伙伴和投资国之一。智民选政府执政后同美关系实现正常化，视对美关系为外交重点，美视智为在拉美优先合作伙伴之一，恢复给予智“普惠制”待遇，允智重新加入美海外投资保险体系，取消了禁止向智出口武器和提供军援的“肯尼迪修正案”。智美建有政治、国防等磋商机制。2021年12月，当选总统博里奇同美国总统拜登通电话。2022年6月，博里奇总统赴美国加利福尼亚出席第九届美洲峰会。9月，博里奇总统赴美国纽约出席第77届联合国大会一般性辩论，会见美国前总统奥巴马并在美洲理事会总部会见企业家。10月，美国国务卿布林肯访问智利。\n\n同欧盟的关系\n巩固和加强同欧盟的传统关系是智的既定方针。欧盟是智重要的贸易伙伴和出口市场。1999年，智欧开始商谈自由贸易协定。2002年双方签署政治、经济伙伴与合作协议，智成为同欧盟签署自贸协定的第二个拉美国家。协议于2003年1月1日起生效。2010年，智与欧盟签订发展和创新伙伴关系协议。2013年1月，智成功举办拉美和加勒比国家共同体和欧盟国家第一次首脑会议。2017年11月，欧盟同智利谈判升级现有的自由贸易协定。2022年4月，博里奇总统同英国首相约翰逊通电话。同月，博里奇总统会见来访的欧盟外交与安全政策高级代表博雷利，表示愿推动欧盟与智升级版伙伴关系协定尽早完成签署。5月，博里奇总统与法国总统马克龙通电话。9月，博里奇总统出席第77届联合国大会一般性辩论期间会见欧盟委员会主席冯德莱恩、法国总统马克龙、德国总理朔尔茨、西班牙首相桑切斯等。2023年1月，德国总理朔尔茨访智。\n\n同亚太国家的关系\n智政府把加强同亚太地区的关系放在其外交的重要位置，认为加强同亚太国家的经贸关系符合其外交多元化和多样化的总目标，对智当前和长远经济发展具有重要战略意义。亚太地区国家是智最大贸易伙伴。1994年11月，智正式加入亚太经合组织。2004年，智作为东道国成功主办了亚太经合组织会议。智积极参与亚太区域经济安排，分别于2007年3月、2008年7月、2010年11月同日本、澳大利亚、马来西亚签署自贸协议。2015年10月，由智利、新加坡、文莱、新西兰发起的跨太平洋伙伴关系协定（TPP）在美国达成。2017年3月，智利主办亚太经济一体化高级别对话会，邀请TPP成员国和中国、韩国、哥伦比亚参加，共同探讨新形势下亚太区域经济一体化走向。2017年11月亚太经合组织第25次领导人非正式会议期间，TPP协定11国宣布就协定核心内容达成一致，并改名为“全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定”（CPTPP）。2018年3月，TPP协定11国在智利正式签署CPTPP。2020年6月，智利同新西兰、新加坡签署数字经济伙伴关系协定（DEPA），2021年8月，智利参议院批准该协定。2022年4月，智利外长乌雷霍拉就太平洋联盟成立11周年视频致辞，表示智利将继续支持太平洋联盟致力于地区一体化的各项工作，将立足性别平等积极参与联盟各项议程。9月，博里奇总统出席第77届联合国大会一般性辩论期间会见新西兰总理阿德恩。11月，博里奇总统出席亚太经合组织第二十九次领导人非正式会议。2023年2月，智利正式成为CPTPP第十个成员国。\n\n同俄罗斯和东欧国家的关系\n近年来，智同俄罗斯和东欧国家双边政治交往有所增加，经贸领域的互惠合作有所发展。智将东欧地区视为进一步开拓出口产品市场的重点地区之一。与匈牙利签署了鼓励和相互保护投资协定，与乌克兰和俄罗斯签署了空间技术合作协定。2010年，智同俄罗斯建立战略合作伙伴关系。2022年，乌克兰危机爆发以来，智政府多次对俄罗斯“入侵”乌克兰表示强烈谴责。2023年4月4日，乌克兰总统泽连斯基向智利国会议员发表在线演讲。\n\n## 旅游\n\n智政府重视发展旅游业。智利著名的旅游地有首都圣地亚哥，神秘的复活节岛等。除原有的沿海海滨和南部的风景区外，近几年又投资开辟了一些新的旅游景点，进一步完善旅游服务设施，如建造滑雪中心，组织南极观光和国际音乐会等。\n\n### 景点\n\n圣地亚哥\n圣地亚哥座落于智利中部的中央谷地，全名“圣地亚哥－德智利”，是智利的首都和最大城市，也是圣地亚哥首都大区的首府。该城市为南美洲第四大城市，是智利全国政治、经济、文化和交通中心。\n圣地亚哥为智利的天然旅游城市，拥有众多的旅游资源，博物馆、美术馆、公园众多，圣卢西亚山是观赏整个城市的最佳地点。\n圣卢西亚山\n圣卢西亚山为智利著名的风景区，山高230米，为锥形山岗。与其说圣卢西亚山是一座山，不如说是一个依山建筑、精巧别致的花园。山脚下的入口处有深红色宫殿式大门，附近矗立着一座印第安反殖民统治战争中的英雄的塑像。一条弯弯曲曲的山路盘旋而上，直通山顶。山上有古希腊雅典式的白石门廊，门廊两侧是古朴、苍劲的巨型壁画。\n圣卢西亚山满山都是茎干肥硕、形态各异的仙人掌，色彩艳丽的花草点缀其间。山腰有一处“石泉”，泉水缓缓从造型优美的石雕顽童怀抱的罐子中流淌出来，在郁郁葱葱的林木中形成一潭碧水。小平台上点燃着长明火把，山坡上还建有美洲民间艺术博物馆。山顶修有七角古堡，从古堡顶上可俯瞰全市。古堡、雉堞和铜炮年代久远，迄今保存完好。站在古堡前俯视全市，长3公里、宽100米的奥希金斯大街横贯全城，公路上汽车川流不息，两侧高楼大厦林立；解放广场、宪法广场、巴格达诺广场等历历在目。古堡附近有曲径盘旋的假山以及飞洒的喷泉，景色秀美多姿，有“空中花园”之称。山顶还建有西班牙殖民者1540年建造的南美洲第一座炮台——克鲁普炮台。\n阿塔卡马沙漠\n阿塔卡马沙漠是南美洲智利北部的沙漠，是最干旱的地方之一。介于南纬18°～28°之间，南北长约1100公里，从沿海到东部山麓宽100多公里。在副热带高气压带下沉气流、离岸风和秘鲁寒流综合影响下，使本区成为世界最干燥的地区之一，且在大陆西岸热带干旱气候类型中具有鲜明的独特性，形成了沿海、纵向狭长的沙漠带。气候极端干旱，少雨多雾；相对湿度较高，可达70%以上；年雨量一般在50毫米以下，北部尚不到10毫米，且变率很大；有些地方曾多年不雨。多盐沼。铜和硝石藏量丰富，南回归线北侧的丘基卡马塔（Chuquicamata）有世界著名的露天大铜矿，沿海有帕波索（Paposo）的铜矿，北部沙漠区有闻名世界的天然硝石矿。\n沿岸由秘鲁寒流带来南极冷水，使空气下冷上暖，造成逆温层，亦不利于成雨。在一个世纪中，伊基克（Iquique）和安托法加斯塔只下过2～4次大雨。温度较低，安托法加斯塔平均夏温18℃（65℉）。这片沙漠在19世纪本分属智利、玻利维亚和秘鲁三国，它们为争夺资源经常发生冲突。1879～1883年的太平洋战争，智利获胜，遂永久占有这块地区。从19世纪中叶以后开采硝石。第一次世界大战前智利硝石垄断世界市场，年产量达300万吨。自从人工合成氮出现后，硝石市场大为缩小，当地繁荣一落千丈。\n拉帕努伊国家公园（复活节岛）\n拉帕努伊国家公园位于复活节岛上，复活节岛是世界上最与世隔绝的岛屿之一，拉帕努伊国家公园也成为最与世隔绝的公园之一。此公园具有独特的巨型雕刻和建筑。从十世纪到十六世纪期间，建筑了神殿并树立起了巨大的石像，称为莫阿伊，它们至今仍是一道无与伦比的文化风景，使整个世界为之着迷。\n拉帕努伊国家公园因有巨石雕像而闻名于世，与巨石人像一起流向人世的还有无数不解之谜，比如朗戈木板之谜。拉帕努伊国家公园里最著名的是巨大的石雕像，已发现的约有1000尊，此外还有大石城遗迹。这些巨大的石雕像大多在海边，有的竖立在草丛中，有的倒在地面上，有的竖在祭坛上。石像一般7～10米高，重约90吨，它们的头较长、眼窝深、鼻子高、下巴突出、耳朵较长，没有脚，双臂垂在身躯两旁，双手放在肚皮上。这些石雕像是用淡黄色火山石雕刻成的。有的石雕像身上还刻着符号，有点像纹身图案。在石像附近曾经发现过刻满奇异图案的木板，人称“会说话的木板”， 但这些木板后来遭遇了“文明者”带来的浩劫。\n\n### 签证\n\n1、须持有最短6个月的有效护照。\n2、须持有智利方面的邀请函正本（应注明邀请人的住所、电话和传真号码，以及被邀请人的姓名、出生日期、护照号码和旅行的原因），并经过公证和智外交部及中国大使馆的认证。\n3、须持有所在中方单位出具的在职证明（附译文并注明单位地址、电话和传真号码）。证明中需说明旅行的原因。如系商务等团组，应提供全团名单。如系在校学生或未成年人，须提供学习证明。", "## 智利\n智利共和国（República de Chile），通称智利（Chile），是位于南美洲的国家。该国别称丝带国。智利西部与南部濒临太平洋，北靠秘鲁，东邻玻利维亚及阿根廷。该国为南美洲国家联盟的成员国，在南美洲与阿根廷及巴西并列为“ABC强国”。除此之外，智利与厄瓜多尔同为不与巴西相接的南美洲国家。\n智利地处美洲大陆的最南端，与南极洲仅隔德雷克海峡相望，为全球最南端的国家（对南极洲的主权申索不计算在内），因此智利人经常称自己的国家作“天涯之国”。智利人口约有1,800万，种族以白人、混血族群居多，与另一国家阿根廷同样，几乎没有非洲裔人口，其他则以本土原住民少数族群相对为多。智利教育高度发达，其教育素质与水准在发达国家获普遍承认。智利在新闻自由、人类发展指数、民主发展等方面也取得很高的排名，可与南欧国家相媲美。社会方面，智利约相当于经济处于已开发阶段的北美洲及欧洲国家。近年来，有不少亚裔移民专程跨越太平洋移居智利。\n智利拥有非常丰富的矿产资源、森林资源，以及渔业资源，北部安托法加斯塔大区的埃斯孔迪达铜矿是目前全球年产量最高的露天铜矿。其境内的阿塔卡马沙漠是世界旱极，藏有大量的铜和锂资源；中部则是文化和政治中心；森林资源主要集中在南部。在智利的南海岸有着错综复杂的由峡湾、湖泊、运河和岛屿组成的迷宫。智利也是世界上绝大多数天然硝石矿的生产国。\n## 名称来源\n16世纪的西班牙作家迭戈·德·罗萨莱斯（ Diego de Rosales）的著作里最先出现「Chile」这个名称，是由当地印第安人土著的克丘亚语“奇里”演化而来的，“奇里”就是他们说的“寒冷”的意思\n其他理论认为，智利的名字可能来自印加人单词，意思是“地球的尽头”或“海鸥”。\n## 历史\n智利北部在西班牙征服者到达以前是印加帝国的一部分。自16世纪起西班牙人开始征服智利（1541年圣地牙哥建城）。南方的马普切人顽强反抗西班牙人的入侵。这里一直到19世纪中才成为智利的一部分。\n1810年9月18日，以被罢黜的西班牙国王斐迪南七世之名成立了临时军政府，自此开启智利独立运动，故此日成为智利国庆日。\n1818年2月12日智利在贝尔纳多·奥希金斯的领导之下宣布独立。19世纪内西班牙外的许多欧洲裔移民到智利。在1879年到1883年的硝石战争中智利占领了那时属于秘鲁和玻利维亚的阿他加马沙漠。\n1930年的世界经济大萧条对智利造成十分严重的打击。铜和硝石的价格巨跌。从1930年代后经济逐渐得到恢复。\n1960年5月22日发生智利大地震。\n1970年，社会主义政党人民团结阵线的领袖萨尔瓦多·阿连德被竞选为总统。其社会主义改革政策使许多产业（如铜矿）被国有化，支援在秘鲁发动军事革命的贝拉斯科政权，并与古巴重新建立外交关系。另一方面，担心智利成为西半球的第二个古巴的美国利用中情局支援其国内反对派，世界银行大幅度削减了给予智利政府的贷款。\n1973年9月11日，智利陆军首长奥古斯托·皮诺切特发动政变。拒绝下台的阿连德自杀，皮诺切特成为国家元首。在接下来的1974年，皮诺切特奠定了以自己为首的军事独裁制度，秘密警察的活动导致上千人被杀，包括人民团结阵线在内的许多持不同政见者都受到镇压，上百万阿连德的支持者被迫流离。\n皮诺切特政府上任后推行一系列市场经济政策，进行一系列减税和私有化改革，创造了智利奇迹，但经济波动较大。\n1988年全民表决中，大多数人反对皮诺切特继续任职。\n1989年自由选举，基督教民主党人帕特里西奥·艾尔文·阿索卡尔被选为总统，1990年3月11日就职，结束了皮诺切特17年的统治。\n1994年至2000年间，基督教民主党人爱德华多·弗雷当选总统。1998年皮诺切特从陆军首长职务退位，同年在英国被捕。其后他被软禁。2000年，由于身体健康的原因被释放。2000年起社会民主党人里卡多·拉戈斯·埃斯科瓦尔当选总统。\n2006年1月15日，米歇尔·巴切莱特在选举中获胜，当选该国历史上第一位女总统。3月11日，巴切莱特在瓦尔帕莱索宣誓就职为智利共和国第47位总统。\n2010年2月27日凌晨3时34分，智利南部的康赛普西翁发生里氏规模8.8地震。地震在智利全国造成至少750人死亡，200多万人不同程度受灾。地震灾区交通中断，房屋倒塌严重。\n2010年3月10日，塞巴斯蒂安·皮涅拉就任智利总统，标志近20年来智利右派重新夺回总统的宝座。\n2014年3月11日，米歇尔·巴切莱特再次就任智利总统。\n2018年3月11日，塞巴斯蒂安·皮涅拉再次就任智利总统。\n2022年3月11日，加夫列尔·博里奇以35岁之龄就任智利总统，成为智利史上最年轻的国家元首。\n## 地理\n智利南北距离4300多公里，位于安第斯山脉与太平洋之间，东西平均距离却只有200公里（最宽处大约400公里左右），令国土看起来相当狭窄，几乎成为全世界国土最狭长的国家之一，因此智利亦有“丝带国”称号。\n大致上智利可分三个区域，或可细分为五个自然区域。\n从西向东首先是一条狭窄的海岸，然后是山脉，然后是比较宽的高原。在中部这个高原很肥沃，可以被用作耕地和牧场。智利和玻利维亚和阿根廷的边界线是安第斯山脉的东山脊。\n除此之外太平洋中的胡安·费尔南德斯群岛和复活节岛也属智利。\n年平均降雨量在智利北部的安托法加斯塔为12.7毫米，在圣地牙哥为375毫米，在南部的火地岛为5800毫米。\n### 气候\n由于国土横跨38个纬度，而且各地区地理条件不一，智利的气候复杂多样包括多种形态，很难用一句话总结智利全国的气候状况。按照柯本气候分类法，在智利国境内至少包括了七种主要的气候亚类型，包括北部的沙漠和东部及东南部的Alpine tundra和冰川，复活节岛上的湿润亚热带性气候，智利南部的海洋性气候以及智利中部的地中海气候。全国大多数地区有四个季节：夏季（12月至2月），秋季（3月至5月），冬季（6月至8月）和春季（9月至11月）。\n### 时区\n由于智利本土和复活节岛之间的距离遥远，因此智利全国使用4种不同的UTC时间：\n## 行政区划\n智利全国分为16个大区（regiones）。每个大区都有一个区域首长（Intendant），由智利总统委任。大区之下为省份，全国共有54个省份。从前，大区名称的字首都有罗马数字，以示其区号。2018年2月颁布的《加强区域法》（第21074号法律）删除了该区号。\n### 城市\n重要城市有圣地牙哥、康塞普西翁、瓦尔帕莱索、伊基克、蒙特港、蓬塔阿雷纳斯等。\n## 人口\n2012年智利人口普查16,341,929人。由于1990年代以来的出生率下降，智利人口增长率一直在下降，预计2050年前后人口会达到2,020万，并且会出现人口负增长。\n智利是一个多民族的社会，这意味着这个国家的人是由许多国家移民后裔以及印第安人、各种混血人组成的。在智利，59％的人口认为自己是欧洲白人后裔，25％的人口认为自己是麦士蒂索人（欧洲白人后裔和印第安人通婚形成的混血种人），其余为非洲黑人后裔、印第安人等其他民族。智利的白人主要由西班牙殖民者后裔组成（主要是西班牙人，安达卢西亚和巴斯克人），还有从葡萄牙、意大利、爱尔兰、法国、希腊、德国、英国、荷兰、克罗地亚、俄罗斯、波兰、匈牙利等国移民到智利的，当然也有这些欧洲民族之间的混血人和从中东到智利的阿拉伯人后裔。非洲裔人口一直比较少，约占智利人口1.5%。多年来，智利亦接受了来自玻利维亚、厄瓜多尔、哥伦比亚、巴西、委内瑞拉、墨西哥、加拿大、美国、中美洲、乌拉圭、加勒比地区、巴拉圭、秘鲁、中国大陆、日本、台湾、韩国的移民。根据2011年人口普查，智利的8％的人口认为自己是原住民。\n###语言\n智利通用西班牙语（但是当地西班牙语颇具自己的特点，例如“Chile”念做ˈʃiːle）。马普切语、南玻利维亚克丘亚语、艾马拉语、拉帕努伊语是土著语言。在智利南部部分地区，也有人使用德语。\n## 政治\n智利是总统制共和国，其宪法（由奥古斯托·皮诺切特制定的）是1980年制定的。但许多重要的基本法是1989年才制定的。\n总统每4年选举产生，不可连任。国会由两个院组成。参议院有50名成员，众议院有155名成员。\n智利从1987年起开放党禁。其中最重要的有：基督民主党（Partido Demócrata Cristiano, PDC）；社会民主党（Partido por la Democracia, PPD）；保守民族革新党（Renovación Nacional, RN）和社会主义党（Partido Socialista, PS）。\n##军事\n智利军队包括了陆、海、空三军。智利总统是其最高统帅，并且通过国防部制定政策。近几年经过几次大的装备更新，智利军成为拉丁美洲一支技术最精良、最专业的军队。武器装备主要来自德国、美国、以色列、法国和西班牙。\n## 经济\n2010年，智利全国总劳动人口约为7,580,000人。2005年，13.2％的劳动力从事农业，23％工业和63.9％服务业。\n2013年，名义计算国内生产总值约为2,857.03亿美元，人均国内生产总值17,048美元，已经接近发达国家水平。而购买力平价的人均GDP，则超过20,000美元。\n智利农业发达，主要种植苹果、葡萄、玉米、洋葱、小麦、大蒜、豆类等作物，葡萄酒产量高。2006年智利捕鱼量4,442,877吨。\n工矿业是智利国民经济命脉。1991年，智利出口的物品里48%为矿产品。智利是全球最大铜矿产品生产国，铜给智利带来了滚滚财富。例如，埃斯孔迪达铜矿（Escondida），生产全球8%的矿石产铜。\n智利拥有南美洲各国最高的经济自由度指数（排全球第七）、清廉指数，被世界银行集团视为高收入经济体，按照部分评判标准（例如人类发展指数）它又可以算作发达国家。2010年，智利成为南美洲第一个OECD成员国。虽然是拉美最富有的国家之一，惟贫富悬殊问题严重，社会对当地的税制、劳工法和养老金制度等均有改革呼声。\n智利官方货币为智利比索。\n##交通\n智利的交通主要靠公路，但由于该国最南端并没有直接通过公路与中部相连，故水路运输也在那里发挥了作用。铁路在智利历史上曾具有重要地位，但现在该国的运输系统中所起的作用相对较小。由于该国的地理位置和主要城市之间的距离很远，航空业也很重要。\n##外交\n智利与世界上172个国家建立有外交关系。智利是南美国家联盟、美洲国家组织、拉美和加勒比国家共同体、亚太经合组织、Pacific Economic Cooperation Council、Pacific Basin Economic Council、不结盟运动、Group of 15等国际和地区组织的成员国和南方共同市场的联系国。\n## 文化\n智利文化集成欧洲移民传统，融合印第安人风俗，吸收北美潮流，因此智利文化既有别于世界各文化，又有相似之处。\n### 文学\n智利被誉为诗人的国家（un país de poetas）。1945年，加夫列拉·米斯特拉尔是拉丁美洲第一位诺贝尔文学奖得主，也是至今唯一来自拉丁美洲的诺贝尔文学奖女性得主；另一名著名的智利诗人是巴勃罗·聂鲁达，他于1971年获得诺贝尔文学奖，并因其关于爱情和政治的大量作品而闻名于世。\n### 音乐\n智利民间音乐的特点是与那些从西班牙带来了印度传统的声音的混合。该苦厄嘉（La cueca），自1979年以来的民族舞蹈，就是一个很好的例子：它有其自身的特点根据国家的区域代表。\n### 饮食\n智利人以面食为主，他们喜欢吃海产品、牛肉、羊肉等。智利的名菜以海鲜闻名，Caldillo de Congrio是一种鱼汤；Chupe de Mariscos是用牡蛎或用鲜鱼炖成的菜。其他菜有\n鸡肉蔬菜汤（Cazuela de ave）、辣味玉米粽子（Humitas）、牛排米饭（Bife Lomo）、瓦锅蒸牛排面（Tallarines con Lomito）等。\n智利人喜欢一种小食称为Empanada，外观类似中国“韭菜盒子”，填充馅可为各种食材，如牛肉、鸡蛋、起士、火腿等等。\n### 宗教\n70%的人信仰天主教，15%信仰新教，3.3%信仰后期圣徒运动，1%信仰耶和华见证人，8.3%的人为无神论者。\n### 体育\n智利最受欢迎的运动是足球。其中包括举办过1962年世界杯，该年智利国家足球队获得第三名，另外智利曾获得两次美洲杯冠军（2015年和2016年）。\n在夏季奥运会上，智利共获得两枚金牌（网球）、七枚银牌（田径、马术、拳击、射击和网球）和四枚铜牌（网球、拳击和足球）。\n## 教育\n智利教育高度发达，其教育在发达国家普遍承认。大部分的大学都和世界著名大学在大学部和研究生学习上拥有协议，其中有在美国，中国，德国，瑞典，澳大利亚，巴西，芬兰，日本，西班牙和英国等等的著名大学。比如，智利天主教大学每年接收将近1350名外国留学生，基本来自于美国，欧洲和新西兰。\n目前在校学生为425万，其中6至18岁的学生为360万，大学生65万。成人识字率为95.79%，文盲率为4.09%左右。人均受教育时间为9.25年。2002年教育经费支出为19585.44亿比索（约合28亿美元）。著名大学有：智利天主教大学、智利大学、康塞普西翁大学。其中智利天主教大学是全南美排名第二、世界排名第228位的大学（据美国时代周刊2006年世界大学排行榜资料显示），其学校和与著名高校比如斯坦福大学合作密切互相认可。"],

区划沿革\n\n1940年7月，“河北18村”划属清江县，其他境域未变。\n1943年7月，原冠县的第六、八区（张庄和清水区）划属冠堂边办事处；同年11月，冠堂边办事处撤销，第六区划属武训县，第八区及冠、馆路以北划属永智县。时县域北界为冠堂路和冠馆路，西界至唐寺，东界和南界为原县境，时境域最小。\n1945年8月，撤销武训县，永智县和冠县合并称永智县，是年12月，恢复冠县称谓。县域东界辛集的刘八寨，西界漳卫河东岸的南馆陶和北馆陶，南界、北界未变。\n1946年3月，南馆陶区、北馆陶区回属馆陶县，县境与1940年前县属河南境域大体相当。\n1956年3月，原堂邑县的柳林区、辛集区和温集区的定远寨、范王庄、黑周3个乡划属冠县，县域扩大。\n1958年12月，馆陶县全部、莘县的燕店和王奉两公社划归冠县，时县境南北长50公里，东西宽52.5公里，面积2127.8平方公里1961年7月，冠县、馆陶县两县分治，原馆陶县地回属馆陶，原莘县燕店、王奉公社回属莘县。\n1965年3月，馆陶县属漳卫河东岸南馆陶区的张庄、么庄、东古城、乜村和北馆陶区的杨召、万善、肖城、许庄、城关等9个公社再次划归冠县，至今境域未变。\n\n### 区划详情\n\n2021年，冠县共有3个街道（清泉、崇文、烟庄），12个镇（东古城、北馆陶、清水、柳林、桑阿镇、贾镇、店子、定远寨、辛集、梁堂、范寨、甘官屯），3个乡（斜店、兰沃、万善）；\n一个经济开发区属非行政区域。县政府驻清泉街道红旗北路109号。\n\n## 地理环境\n\n### 位置境域\n\n冠县地处山东西部边陲，位于东经115°16′～115°47′、北纬36°22′～36°42′之间。东临东昌府区，北界临清市，南接莘县，与河南省范县仅有一县之隔，西隔漳卫河与河北省馆陶县和大名县相望。全境南北长35公里，东西宽45公里，总面积1161平方公里。\n\n### 地形地貌\n\n冠县全境处于鲁西北黄泛平原，系华北平原的一部分。地势开阔平坦，但略有起伏。地形自西南向东北倾斜，地面坡降为1/6000～1/7000。海拔高程一般为42.5～35米，最高点在西南部斜店乡的樊楼村，高达54.8米；最低点在东部史庄乡的花园村，仅34.6米。由于历史上古黄河不断改道、决口，淤积、沉淀大量泥沙物质，境内形成了岗、坡、洼相间的微地貌差异。\n\n### 气候\n\n冠县境内属暖温带季风区域大陆性半干旱气候，四季分明，光照充足，无霜期较长。春旱多风，雨热同步，盛夏、初秋多雨，晚秋易旱，冬季干冷为四季气候的主要特点。县境内年平均气温为13.1℃，境内多年降水量平均值576.4毫米，境内气压的年变化属大陆基本型，年平均气压为1012百帕。\n\n### 水文\n\n冠县境内主要河流分漳卫运河与马颊河两大水系，均属于海河流域。漳卫运河为冠县西部边界，境内全长39.51公里，流域面积270平方公里。马颊河从县境东南边界通过，与境内京杭运河连接，全长20公里，流域面积882平方公里，是季节性河流。横贯境内连接漳卫运河与马颊河之间的人工干渠有七条：①一干渠，全长42.05公里，流经县城区；流域面积264平方公里，②老二干渠，全长20.3公里，流域面积84.6平方公里；③新二干渠，全长28.3公里，流域面积206平方公里；⑤青年渠，全长29.9公里，流域面积153平方公里；⑥位山三干渠，沿境内东北角穿过，全长189公里，流域面积90平方公里，是引黄济津的主渠道；⑦长顺渠，全长27.29公里，流域面积269平方公里。\n\n##

发展历程\n\n关东管领上杉家的威信在1546年被北条家大败后便急速下降，关东的很多势力都投奔到北条家。北条氏康于1551年将上杉宪政赶到越后，并收纳了厩桥，沼田城等势力。另一方面，继承上杉家名的上杉谦信于1560年出兵上野沼田，厩桥等城，夺回两城，关东武士团又投奔上杉氏。谦信攻略小田原城未果，于鹤冈八幡宫举行就任关东管领的仪式后便返回越后，逐渐关东武士团又脱离上杉家的支配。但谦信令厩桥的北条高广，那波的长尾谦忠，武藏松山的上杉宪胜，于1562年夺取馆林城，决定了对上野的支配权。1563年武田家入侵上野，在真田幸隆的奋战下攻落仓贺野城，收取了吾妻郡。之后武田军又攻击安中，松井田等城，为牵制信玄，谦信出兵信浓，但最终东上野诸势力要夺回西上野的企图失败。1566年箕轮城落城，西上野完全落入武田家，上野国人众又倒向武田家，决定了上杉势力在上野的衰退。厩桥城代北条高广也开始私通北条家。今川义元战死后的1568年，武田信玄入侵今川领地导致甲相骏同盟破裂，之后北条家与上杉家结盟。上野国大致形成了，上杉以厩桥为中心控制中东部的，群马，势多，利根，那波，四郡；北条以馆林为中心控制东南部的邑乐，新田，山田，佐位，四郡；武田以箕轮为中心控制上野国剩下的西部，西南部六郡；的形式。而北条氏康死后氏政再次连结武田，上野在上杉，武田，北条势力争来争去。武田信玄死后，上野的诸势力争相扩张地盘，最后由良氏取得胜利。次年，谦信出兵与北条家作战，无果后撤退。1578年，谦信和由良成繁相继死去，在长筱之战大败而采取守势的武田家企图入侵东上野，但1582年被织田氏所灭，上野逐渐归于织田家势力范围。信长令泷川一益以厩桥城作为关东攻略的据点。信长死后，一益势力衰退。厩桥的北条高广和沼田的真田昌幸等城再次从属于北条家。后真田家背叛北条氏，在沼田展开了北条和真田的攻防战，随后由羽柴秀吉调停。但由于1590年的名胡桃城事件，北条和真田再次对立，也给了丰臣家讨伐北条的口实。前田利家率兵进入上野，驱逐北条家势力。战后，德川家康受封上野，将平岩，本多，井伊，神原等谱代配置于此，江户幕府成立后，形成了诸藩分割统治的体制。\n\n##

"InternLM_answers": ["上野国位于关东地区，国内有大量的豪族势力，其中包括沼田氏，馆林氏，赤岩氏，新田氏，厩桥氏等等。这些豪族势力在关东管领上杉氏的统治下，大多数时候都保持着相对的稳定。在上杉氏的统治下，这些豪族势力被任命为国内的守护，管理国内的政务。同时，这些豪族势力也被赋予了一定的军事权力，负责保护国内的安全。在上杉氏的统治下，这些豪族势力之间的关系相对稳定，没有出现大规模的争斗和冲突。然而，在上杉氏衰退之后，上野国的势力发生了很大的变动。由于上杉氏的衰落，国内的豪族势力开始逐渐崛起，争夺国内的控制权。其中，最为强大的是沼田氏和馆林氏。这两个家族在国内的势力非常强大，控制了大量的领土和人口。同时，这两个家族之间的关系也非常紧张，经常发生争斗和冲突。在这种情况下，上野国的政治局势变得非常不稳定，经常出现内乱和战争。", "上野国在日本历史上发生过许多重要的战争和事件，包括但不限于：\n\n1. 武藏国入侵事件：公元8世纪初，武藏国的大军入侵上野国，并在赤城山附近展开了激烈的战斗。最终，上野国的军队在赤城山之战中击败了武藏国的入侵者，保卫了国家的安全。\n2. 上野国的建立：公元713年，日本天皇下令将上野国从武藏国中分离出来，成为一个独立的国家。这标志着上野国正式建立。\n3. 上野国的文化繁荣：在江户时代，上野国成为了日本文化的中心之一。许多著名的文化人物，如歌舞伎演员、画家、诗人等，都在上野国活动，为当地的文化繁荣做出了贡献。\n4. 上野国的政治动荡：在江户时代，上野国也经历了一些政治动荡。例如，1868年，上野国的领主被废黜，国家被并入了新的群马县。这一事件标志着上野国作为一个独立的国家的历史结束了。\n5. 上野国的自然灾害：上野国也经历过一些自然灾害，如地震、洪水等。其中，1964年的新潟地震对上野国造成了巨大的破坏，许多人失去了家园和生命。",

{"name": "康斯坦察县", "documents": ["# 康斯坦察县\n\n康斯坦察县（Constanţa）是罗马尼亚的一级行政单位，首府和最大城市为康斯坦察。康斯坦察县位于罗马尼亚东南部，东临黑海，西隔多瑙河与雅洛米察县和克勒拉希县相望，南与保加利亚的多布里奇区和锡利斯特拉区接壤，面积为125平方公里，人口28万。\n\n天津市与罗马尼亚康斯坦察县于1995年3月7日正式签订友好交流与合作意向书。\n\n## 城市状况\n\n县（单数judet，复数judete）是东欧国家罗马尼亚的一级行政单位，总人口为715,172（2002年），康斯坦察县首府为康斯坦察（Constanţa）。\n康斯坦察县面积7071.3平方公里，人口74.8万。其中罗马尼亚族占91.6%、土耳其族和鞑靼族各占3.2%、俄罗斯族占0.7%、其他民族占1.3%。属温带气候。\n\n康斯坦察县具有悠久的历史，由古希腊人创建于公元前6世纪，时称托米斯，是罗马尼亚最古老的地区之一。2001年是康县诞生2510周年，有文字记载的历史为2260周年。下辖康斯坦察市、梅迪吉亚市和曼加利亚等11个市、52个镇、189个村。\n康县是罗马尼亚经济最发达的地区之一，经济多元化，包括农业、旅游、港口与海上运输、机械制造、化学、石油化学、电力、木材加工、造纸等。\n康县文化、教育、娱乐、医疗卫生设施齐全，有298家图书馆、19座博物馆和7座剧院，还有5所大专院校。有8家医院。\n康县交通便利，海滨地区铁路线长406公里，有2条欧洲公路E60和E87，2个航空港。\n康斯坦察港是罗马尼亚主要港口，黑海最大港，不仅连接东西欧洲，而且还连接北非、中东和亚洲。面积3,626公顷，其中陆地面积1784公顷、水域面积1842公顷，年吞吐能力可达2.55亿吨。\n\n## 城市港口\n\n位于罗马尼亚东南部黑海之滨的康斯坦察港，东临黑海，西靠多瑙河，南面就是保加利亚，北面接近俄罗斯。早在公元前6世纪，该处就筑有古希腊城堡，建港历史长达2000余年。\n\n早在1998年，康斯坦察港的集装箱码头吞吐能力就已经达到饱和状态。到了2001年，康斯坦察港集装箱码头的压箱、压船和压港状态，已到了不堪忍受的地步。为了解决康斯坦察港在发展中出现的问题，罗马尼亚政府交通部根据对今后20年该港吞吐量增长率的预测，提出了在康斯坦察南部开发新港口的宏大计划，并获得了日本政府海外经济合作基金组织的大力支持。1998年2月27日，罗马尼亚政府和日本海外合作基金组织在东京签署了专门用于康斯坦察南部新港第一期开发工程的128亿日元的贷款协议，此项贷款占到第一期工程全部投资的75%，其余25%的投资则来自于罗马尼亚的私人资金和自筹资金。这项工程分成3期，已经于2001年竣工的第一期主要是基础设施，如港口码头、公路、铁路、港口大门和面积5,000平方米的集装箱货运站、管理大楼、港口服务设施等。一期工程的设计年吞吐能力为33万标准箱，到2008年将达到80万标准箱。第二期的设计年吞吐能力为55万标准箱，第三期的设计年吞吐能力为90万标准箱。日本政府肯如此慷慨解囊，再次显示了康斯坦察港的战略意义，即意图把康斯坦察港变成日本面向欧洲的集装箱运输配送中心，通过铁路、公路甚至多瑙河的驳船水运，集装箱运输可从黑海一直延伸到欧洲全境。\n康斯坦察南部新港的发展潜力十分惊人，第三期工程完工后的码头，将可以停靠载重量高达20万吨的货船。此外，在新码头的附近，又吹填出大约90公顷的土地，可以扩建为新的集装箱深水码头。现已完工的第一期工程集装箱码头线长625公尺，可以靠泊65,000至100,000总吨的船舶，即相当于3,000标准箱位的集装箱船舶。待第二期工程完工后，集装箱码头线长度将延伸到1,800公尺，泊位吃水将深达14.5至16.5公尺，配备3台岸边桥吊、2台铁路集装箱门吊和8台集装箱堆高机，适合于超巴拿马型集装箱船舶靠泊。\n进入21世纪后，康斯坦察港正在发生巨大的变革。地处多瑙河－黑海交通道口的战略要地，一边是浩瀚无比的亚洲市场，另一边则是中欧和东欧的工业地区。从黑海出发，经过博斯普洛斯海峡和达达尼亚海峡，进入地中海，就可通向全球各大海洋。康斯坦察港已不仅是罗马尼亚的重要口岸，而且成了欧洲地区的“东大门”，迄今已成为欧洲地区的第四大港。\n但是，随着东欧地区加入欧盟和欧洲市场一体化贸易进程的加快，康斯坦察港已受到了日益严重的市场竞争压力。有专家指出，在提高康斯坦察港竞争力的同时，也必须提高康斯坦察市的国际吸引力，其中包括高质量的码头基础设施、达国际水平的城市基本建设、现代化的环境保护、具国际标准的港口服务水平，以及现代化城市应有的商贸经济人文氛围和与国际标准接轨的城市管理模式。", "## 康斯坦察县\n康斯坦察县（Județul Constanța）是罗马尼亚东南部的一个县。东临黑海，南界保加利亚。面积7,071平方公里，2002年人口715,151。首府康斯坦察。\n下设3市、9镇、58乡。"], "selected_questions": ["康斯坦察县的经济主要包括哪些行业？", "康斯坦察港的发展计划中包括哪些工程？第一期工程的主要内容是什么？", "康斯坦察县是罗马尼亚的哪个方位的县？"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["康斯坦察县的经济主要包括农业、旅游、港口与海上运输、机械制造、化学、石油化学、电力、木材加工和造纸等行业。", "康斯坦察港的发展计划包括三个阶段的工程。第一期工程的主要内容是基础设施建设，包括港口码头、公路、铁路、港口大门和集装箱货运站等设施的建设。", "康斯坦察县是罗马尼亚的东南部的一个县。"], "InternLM_answers": ["康斯坦察县的经济主要包括农业、工业、建筑业、运输业、通信业、贸易、酒店和餐饮业、金融业、房地产和商业服务业等行业。", "康斯坦察港的发展计划包括四期工程。第一期工程主要内容包括新建一个多用途码头和一个散货码头，并配套建设相应的堆场、仓库、道路、铁路等附属设施。\n\n第一期工程将由中方企业承建，建设资金由中方提供。中方将通过“两优”贷款支持康斯坦察港项目建设。", "康斯坦察县是罗马尼亚东南部的一个县，位于罗马尼亚的东南部，毗邻黑海。"], "human_GPT3.5_answers_D_ann": [["<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考0：康县是罗马尼亚经济最发达的地区之一，经济多元化，包括农业、旅游、港口与海上运输、机械制造、化学、石油化学、电力、木材加工、造纸等"], ["<幻觉>无法验证\n<参考>参考0：为了解决康斯坦察港在发展中出现的问题，罗马尼亚政府交通部根据对今后20年该港吞吐量增长率的预测，提出了在康斯坦察南部开发新港口的宏大计划，并获得了日本政府海外经济合作基金组织的大力支持。1998年2月27日，罗马尼亚政府和日本海外合作基金组织在东京签署了专门用于康斯坦察南部新港第一期开发工程的128亿日元的贷款协议，此项贷款占到第一期工程全部投资的75%，其余25%的投资则来自于罗马尼亚的私人资金和自筹资金 <SEP>参考0：这项工程分成3期，已经于2001年竣工的第一期主要是基础设施，如港口码头、公路、铁路、港口大门和面积5,000平方米的集装箱货运站、管理大楼、港口服务设施等。一期工程的设计年吞吐能力为33万标准箱，到2008年将达到80万标准箱。第二期的设计年吞吐能力为55万标准箱，第三期的设计年吞吐能力为90万标准箱。\n<改正>无", "<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考0：已经于2001年竣工的第一期主要是基础设施，如港口码头、公路、铁路、港口大门和面积5,000平方米的集装箱货运站、管理大楼、港口服务设施等"], ["<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考0：康斯坦察县（Constanţa）是罗马尼亚的一级行政单位，首府和最大城市为康斯坦察。康斯坦察县位于罗马尼亚东南部，东临黑海"]], "human_InternLM_answers_ann": [["<幻觉>矛盾\n<参考>参考0：康县是罗马尼亚经济最发达的地区之一，经济多元化，包括农业、旅游、港口与海上运输、机械制造、化学、石油化学、电力、木材加工、造纸等\n<改正>“工业、建筑业、运输业、通信业、贸易、酒店和餐饮业、金融业、房地产和商业服务业等行业”改为“旅游、港口与海上运输、机械制造、化学、石油化学、电力、木材加工、造纸等”。"], ["<幻觉>矛盾\n<参考>参考0：这项工程分成3期，已经于2001年竣工的第一期主要是基础设施，如港口码头、公路、铁路、港口大门和面积5,000平方米的集装箱货运站、管理大楼、港口服务设施等\n<改正>“四期工程”改为“三期工程”。", "<幻觉>矛盾\n<参考>参考0：这项工程分成3期，已经于2001年竣工的第一期主要是基础设施，如港口码头、公路、铁路、港口大门和面积5,000平方米的集装箱货运站、管理大楼、港口服务设施等\n<改正>“新建一个多用途码头和一个散货码头，并配套建设相应的堆场、仓库、道路、铁路等附属设施”改为“基础设施，如港口码头、公路、铁路、港口大门和面积5,000平方米的集装箱货运站、管理大楼、港口服务设施等”。", "<幻觉>矛盾\n<参考>参考0：罗马尼亚政府和日本海外合作基金组织在东京签署了专门用于康斯坦察南部新港第一期开发工程的128亿日元的贷款协议，此项贷款占到第一期工程全部投资的75%，其余25%的投资则来自于罗马尼亚的私人资金和自筹资金\n<改正>“第一期工程将由中方企业承建，建设资金由中方提供。”改为“第一期工程的建设资金的75%主要由日本海外合作基金组织提供，剩余的25%由罗马尼亚的私人资金和自筹资金投入。”", "<幻觉>矛盾\n<参考>参考0：参考文档中提到的是日本政府和罗马尼亚政府签署的贷款协议，而非中方的贷款支持\n<改正>“中方将通过“两优”贷款支持康斯坦察港项目建设。”改为“”。"], ["<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考0：康斯坦察县（Constanţa）是罗马尼亚的一级行政单位，首府和最大城市为康斯坦察。康斯坦察县位于罗马尼亚东南部，东临黑海"]], "language": "zh"}
{"name": "布鲁日", "documents": ["# 布鲁日\n\n布鲁日（Bruges），位于比利时西北部，是比利时西佛兰德省省会，也是比利时著名的文化名城、旅游胜地。“布鲁日”在佛兰德语中有“桥”的意思，由流经市内的莱伊河上的一座古罗马桥梁而得名。14世纪为欧洲最大的商港之一。同时也有球队和人以此命名。\n\n## 基本介绍\n\n布鲁日历史中心是典型的中世纪古城，保存着大量数世纪前的建筑。早期，哥特式建筑已经成为城市特色的一个部分。作为欧洲的重要贸易中心和文化中心，布鲁日和世界上其他地方有文化上的联系，比如布鲁日与佛兰芒原始绘画流派(Flemish Primitives)有着密切的关系。2000年被列入世界文化遗产。\n这座始建于中世纪的城市是比利时最受欢迎的旅游目的地，尽管人多，也不能不去。14世纪时，布鲁日是欧洲主要商业中心之一。但在随后的世纪中，这座城市与海洋的水路淤塞了。尽管后来人们修建了一条新的运河，它的辉煌已经不再。布鲁日能唤起人们对遥远年代的追思和梦想。然而，说它是一座保存完好的古代城市，却有部分虚构的成分。这座城市的很大一部分是19世纪和20世纪建造的，仿造中世纪的风格而已。\n\n##

历史追述\n\n19世纪末叶，开始了大规模的港口疏浚和修建工程。20世纪初，连接外港泽布腊赫的运河通航，工商业发展兴起。素有“北方威尼斯”、“比利时艺术圣地”、“佛兰德珍珠”等美称。市内河渠如网，风光旖旎，古式房屋鳞次栉比，市容仍保留有浑厚的中世纪风貌。城区河道环绕，水巷纵横，并有运河通往北海岸外港。每当旅游季节到来，游人络绎不绝，他们乘坐小艇观赏水城全貌。\n在比利时发展的历史中，1815年前，在布鲁塞尔以南名为滑铁卢的小镇附近，英、普联军与法军展开决战，这就是震撼世界的“滑铁卢之战”。布鲁日隔英吉利海峡与伦敦相望，西接海滨旅游城市奥斯坦德(Oostende)，东连弗兰德故都根特和首都布鲁塞尔，北邻荷兰，南傍法国。到布鲁日旅游，巴士、游船、马车和出租自行车不仅走遍全城，而且能载你去远郊的泽布鲁日海滨浴场地丹姆(Damme)田园小城。\n在美丽而娇小的布鲁日，最好的游览方式莫过于步行。小城四周有城墙环绕，城门耸立，有的门边还有风车。从地图上看起来城区状如鹅卵，中心有两个紧邻的广场：布鲁日大市场(Markt)和博格（Burg)广场，邮局和银行都有这里，各游览路线也大多由此展开。\n起源\n前罗马的高卢时代所留下的人类活动痕迹非常少。公元一世纪时凯撒大帝征服门奈比（Menapii）后，建立了此地的第一个要塞以保护海岸免于海盗袭击。公元四世纪时法兰克人从高卢罗马人手上夺取此地并以弗兰德国（Pagus Flandrensis）之名治理之。公元九世纪时由于维京人的袭击，弗兰德伯爵博杜安一世再次强化了要塞的建设；布鲁日和英格兰以及斯堪地那维亚的贸易很快地又恢复进行。大约在此时首次出现了刻有布鲁日（Bryggia）之名的货币，这个名称可能源自于挪威城市布吕根（Bryggen）。\n黄金时代（十二至十五世纪）\n布鲁日于1128年7月27日得到了设立城市的许可状，也建了新的城墙及运河。大约自1050年起，泥沙逐渐淤积使得这个城市不再能直接临北海，不过在1134年的一场暴风雨塑造出了一条天然海道可通往Zwin（今比利时沿海自然保护区）而达北海。这条新的海道延伸到临海城市丹姆，它于是成为了布鲁日贸易的前哨站。\n12世纪，随着城市生活再度旺盛，在弗兰德伯爵们的保护下，羊毛纺织业和布料贸易在此快速而安全地为布鲁日累积了财富。13世纪初，布鲁日已经成为弗兰德布料市场圈中的重要城市之一。城里的企业家门甚至向外经济殖民了英格兰和苏格兰的羊毛生产领域。英格兰的商人们带来了诺曼底的谷物与加斯科涅的葡萄酒，汉萨同盟的船只停满了港口，新式的大木船得要排到丹姆和斯鲁伊斯（Sluys）之间才有空间停放。1277年，从热那亚来的第一艘商船驶进了布鲁日，自此布鲁日成为连接地中海与北海贸易的第一个商业殖民地。这个发展不只是打开了从累范特来的香料贸易，也促进了商务和财政技术的发展，并快速地为布鲁日的银行业带来大量资本。1309年证券交易所开张，在十四世纪时成为低地国家最先进的金融市场，而威尼斯人直到1314年来到布鲁日后才学得了这个金融市场技术。\n不过如此的财富也造成了社会冲突，而在城市的许多地方掀起了严重的暴动。还好在1302年暴动的市民们加入了弗兰德伯爵的行列对抗法国入侵，最后于7月11日在科尔特赖克（Kortrijk）的金马刺之战中取得胜利。今日在市集广场上仍然可见暴动领袖扬·布雷德尔（Jan Breydel）和彼得·德·科宁克（Pieter de Coninck）的雕像。\n14世纪，布鲁日布料贸易的重要性逐渐丧失。1384年来自勃艮第的菲利普二世成为了弗兰德伯爵，他在布鲁塞尔、里耳以及布鲁日设立了他的宫殿，这为布鲁日从全欧洲吸引到了大量的艺术家、银行家以及其他重要人士。布鲁日的主要活动逐渐转变为银行业、奢侈品交易以及文化中心。1376年于城堡广场建了新的市政厅。\n在此，新弗兰德派以其油画技巧驰名天下。世界上第一本印刷的英文书也是在布鲁日由威廉·卡克斯顿（William Caxton）印制。英王爱德华四世与理查三世都在此度过他们的放逐岁月。14世纪无疑地是布鲁日的黄金时代，人口高达约四万六千人，这个数目直到19世纪都没有再超越过。\n16世纪至今\n大约从1500年开始，连那条曾为布鲁日带来繁荣的Zwin海道都开始淤积了，很快地布鲁日作为低地国经济龙头的地位就被安特卫普取代了。17世纪时，蕾丝产业终止了，布鲁日仍想方设法要恢复旧日荣光。1650年代时英王查理二世的行宫以及流亡时的行馆都设在这里。他们将旧的港湾设施现代化了，也建立了新的运河通往海岸，但是并不成功。布鲁日渐渐贫困了并从欧洲的舞台上淡出。乔吉斯·罗登巴赫（Georges Rodenbach）曾将这个沉睡的城市称为“沉寂的布鲁日（Bruges-la-Morte）”，并出版了同名著作。该书引起了各国人士对布鲁日保存的文化和艺术宝藏的兴趣。\n19世纪下半叶，布鲁日成为世界第一批观光胜地之一，吸引了富有的英国与法国观光客。直到20世纪下半叶这个城市才开始渐渐找回过往的荣光。新港口泽布吕赫（Zeebrugge）建于1907年，德军于第一次世界大战时用来停放U型潜艇，1970年代至1980年代早期，泽布吕赫港口扩建成为了欧洲最重要的现代化港口之一。20世纪末，国际观光业越来越蓬勃，在政府与市民的努力下，2000年布鲁日历史中心被联合国教科文组织登录为世界遗产，布鲁日也争取到了2002年欧洲文化之都的头衔。\n\n## 主要建筑\n\n主要古建筑有12世纪的圣约翰医院、13世纪的圣母院、14世纪的哥特式市政厅、15世纪的皇宫旧址、1887年的新哥特式邮政大楼以及始建于10世纪的古老教堂等。14到15世纪期间，这里被认为是佛兰德艺术的摇篮。现市内的教堂、公共建筑物和博物馆内珍藏许多布鲁日画派的大师们如扬·凡·爱克、汉斯·梅姆林和杰勒德·大卫等的绘画。圣母院内还藏有15世纪意大利文艺复兴盛期的大雕塑家和画家米开朗琪罗的《圣母像》。\n市中心的市场大厅上矗立着一座雄伟的钟楼，上有一台有46个钟铃的钟琴，琴声美妙悦耳。在布鲁日的大街小巷，常可以看到妇女们坐在自家门前，编织各种花边、台布等，这是当地的一种独特风俗。\n布鲁日（Brugge）也译作“布吕赫”是比利时著名的旅游城市，布鲁日位于比利时西北部弗兰德平原，距北海14公里。素有“小威尼斯”之称的布鲁日，它是欧洲游览胜地也是浪漫的观光客趋之若鹜的地方，BRUGGE荷语是“桥”的意思，布鲁日还是座水城，河道遍布城里，很多建筑是依河道而建，今日布鲁日有50座以上的桥是标准的水上都市，其建筑以哥德式的文艺复兴时期的式样为主体，布鲁日中世纪曾经是欧洲著名的港口城市和商埠；如今的布鲁日完整地保存了中世纪的城市整体风貌，护城河、城墙等，城市内很少有机动车和柏油路。\n\n## 历史记载\n\n据史书记载，公元9世纪建城，14世纪时已成为欧洲最大的商港。15世纪初，由于外国的竞争，弗兰德的羊毛工业逐渐衰落，其经济地位被安特卫普所取代，但布鲁日仍是仅次于安特卫普的欧洲主要输入港。到达布鲁日的第一个印象是城内河渠如网，河上游船如织，大小桥梁随处可见。在河道两旁，一幢幢中世纪的建筑掩映在绿树丛中，这旖旎的水乡风光，使游人恍如隔世，回到遥远的年代，在市中心广场，历史古迹比比皆是。建于公元1376年的市政厅，是比利时最古老的市政厅，正面六扇尖顶穹窿窗垂直排列，造型新颖，别具特色；市政厅的外墙上刻有浮雕，内容取材于圣经故事和历史人物，形象鲜明，生动传神，不远处，还有几座文艺复兴时期遗留下来的古老教堂，如圣桑大教堂，圣安娜教堂、圣雅各教堂、圣血教堂……其外形有哥特式、巴罗克式、拜占庭式，颇为壮观，教堂内保存着布鲁日画派大师们如扬·凡·爱克、汉斯·梅姆林和杰勒德·大卫等人的绘画珍品，其中圣血教堂内相传藏有1150年从圣地带回几滴基督血的金匣，圣约翰医院小教堂中藏有油画鼻祖扬·凡·爱克的多幅名作。圣母院是布鲁日最为著名的历史古迹，建于13世纪。这里珍藏的15世纪意大利雕塑大师米开朗琪罗的大理石雕塑“圣母像”是举世闻名的艺术佳作。\n布鲁日被誉为\"北方的威尼斯\"。\n\n## 著名建筑\n\n宗教建筑---教堂\n圣救世主教堂(The church of Saint-Sauveur)最早的记载是在988年，13世纪以法国哥特式风格重建，并于1834年成为布鲁日的主教堂(cathedral)。\n圣母教堂(The church of Notre Dame)最早在1089年作为教区教堂被记录下来，其尖塔高达120米，是全欧洲最高的钟楼。它保存着金羊毛骑士团(the Order of the Golden Fleece)1468年的完整徽章系列。\n圣安妮教堂(The churche of Sainte-Anne)和圣瓦布鲁教堂(The churche of Sainte-Walburge)是17世纪巴洛克风格的典范。\n圣马德莲教堂(The church of Sainte-Madeleine,1851-53)是新哥特式建筑(Neo-gothic archetecture)的重要一员。\n耶路撒冷礼拜堂(The Jerusalem Chapel)建于一次耶路撒冷朝圣之后(1471-72)，风格引用圣墓教堂(the church of Saint Sepulchre)。\n圣巴西勒双礼拜堂，或称圣血礼拜堂(the Chapel of the Holy Blood)建于12世纪中叶，礼拜堂下部还保持着罗马式的内部，而上部则在19世纪被重建。\n修道院\n原邓恩修道院(Abbey of Dunes)是布鲁日著名修道院之一，由西多会修士建于1628-42年。教堂是18世纪末期的古典式。\n原耶稣会修道院(Convent of the Jesuits)有两条建于17世纪的走廊(aisle)，从耶稣会被镇压时期起用作学校。\n葡萄园皇家修女院(Béguinage Princier de la Vigne)建于13世纪，其名意指法国国王腓力四世(Philippe le Bel)。其空间接合(spatial articulation)属典型的中世纪风格，并带有17世纪的晚期哥特风，自1927年起由本笃会使用。\n上帝之家(H&ocirc;tels-Dieu，即敬老院)是城中一大特色，其中46所留存至今。它们为老年人而建，大致分为两种类型：一种带有中央庭院，一种直面大街。其中最早的建于14世纪，如今被租给经济来源有限的老年人们，依然符合当年建造的初衷。\n圣让医院(H&ocirc;pital Saint-Jean)建于12世纪中叶。中世纪所建部分中有三个被保存下来，直到19世纪中叶被改为博物馆。而19世纪建造的部分则在1976年被改建为议会中心。\n世俗建筑\n建于13世纪的大厅和钟楼(Halls and the Belfry，高83米)，象征城市自治市政厅(Town Hall)大约建于1376-86年，是低地地区最古老的市政厅之一。布鲁日法兰克宫(Palace of Franc de Brugge)有着复杂的历史。在11世纪，此地是伯爵的住宅，但从14世纪起改为法院和市政部门。建筑在16世纪早期被改建，又在18世纪时增加了一些部分。从1795年至1984年这里仍是法院，而后则一直是市政部门。\n\n##

博物馆\n\n布鲁日钻石博物馆，在全世界仅有的五个钻石博物馆中是最年轻的，1999年成立于比利时西弗兰德尔省的首府布鲁日。布鲁日是钻石抛光技术的诞生地，由当地金匠路德维希.凡.伯克姆于15世纪发明。\n布鲁日钻石博物馆以独特的视角展示了钻石世界中通常不为世人所知的秘密。\n有记者以“布鲁日皇冠上的一颗明珠”来譬喻布鲁日钻石博物馆是再恰当不过了。\n布鲁日钻石博物馆展示了若干独特的主题，路德维希.凡.伯克姆的作坊内景；布鲁日手工制作的约克玛格丽特珍贵的王冠复制品；布鲁日在中世纪进出口的所有样品；原始的采矿设备和矿井，一个独一无二的用立方锆制成的表示全世界钻石产量的1比1模型；数百件在布鲁日的钻石业中曾使用过的加工工具，包括用来切割、研磨、抛光的真实的工具，当然还有几千颗真正的钻石。\n每天中午12：15，在博物馆的抛光间由钻石抛光师进行钻石抛光表演，该抛光间是完全按照中世纪的样子复原的。\n该博物馆是在专业团体和布鲁日市府共同努力下建成的，团体中的支柱人物是历史学家路德.范德姆，是《布鲁日钻石》一书的著者之一。\n在博物馆中漫步，犹如进行了一次穿越时空隧道的旅行：15世纪的布鲁日是世界钻石业的中心，在16世纪钻石业从布鲁日转移到安特卫普，17、18世纪到了阿姆斯特丹，20世纪南非发现开采钻石矿，如今布鲁日钻石业兴旺发达，钻石活动遍布世纪。", "## 布鲁日\n布吕赫（Brugge，Nl-Brugge.ogg），更为人熟知的是其法语名布鲁日（Bruges，LL-Q150 (fra)-Jules78120-Bruges.wav），是比利时弗拉芒大区西佛兰德省的一座港口城市，也是该省省会及最大城市，通行荷兰语，是弗拉芒社群的一部分，面积140.99平方千米，人口P1082人（P585）。布鲁日在欧洲也被誉为「北方的威尼斯」，其港口具有重要的经济意义，曾是世界主要的商业城市之一，该城以欧洲学院的所在地而闻名，这是一所研究欧洲的大学学院。\n## 历史\n### 起源\n前罗马的高卢时代所留下的人类活动痕迹非常少。公元一世纪时凯撒大帝征服梅纳皮（Menapii）后，建立了此地的第一个要塞以保护海岸免于海盗袭击。公元四世纪时法兰克人从高卢罗马人手上夺取此地并以法兰德斯帕古斯（Pagus Flandrensis）之名治理之。公元九世纪时由于维京人的袭击，佛兰德伯爵博杜安一世再次强化了要塞的建设；布鲁日和英格兰以及斯堪地那维亚的贸易很快地又恢复进行。大约在此时首次出现了刻有布里吉亚（Bryggia）之名的货币，这个名称可能源自于挪威卑尔根的布吕根区（Bryggen）。\n### 黄金时代（十二至十五世纪）\n布鲁日于1128年7月27日获得了设立城市的许可状，也建了新的城墙及运河。大约自1050年起，泥沙逐渐淤积使得这个城市不再能直接临北海，不过在1134年的一场暴风雨塑造出了一条天然海道可通往兹温（Zwin，今比利时沿海自然保护区）而达北海。这条新的海道延伸到临海城市达默，它于是成为了布鲁日贸易的前哨站。\n12世纪，随著城市生活再度旺盛，在佛兰德伯爵们的保护下，羊毛纺织业和布料贸易在此快速而安全地为布鲁日累积了财富。13世纪初，布鲁日已经成为法兰德斯布料市场圈中的重要城市之一。城里的企业家门甚至向外经济殖民了英格兰和苏格兰的羊毛生产领域。英格兰的商人们带来了诺曼底的谷物与加斯科涅的葡萄酒，汉萨同盟的船只停满了港口，新式的大木船得要排到达默和斯勒伊斯之间才有空间停放。1277年，从热那亚来的第一艘商船驶进了布鲁日，自此布鲁日成为连接地中海与北海贸易的第一个商业殖民地。这个发展不只是打开了从累范特来的香料贸易，也促进了商务和财政技术的发展，并快速地为布鲁日的银行业带来大量资本。1309年证券交易所开张，在十四世纪时成为低地国家最先进的金融市场，而威尼斯人直到1314年来到布鲁日后才学得了这个金融市场技术。\n不过如此的财富也造成了社会冲突，而在城市的许多地方掀起了严重的暴动。还好在1302年暴动的市民们加入了佛兰德伯爵的行列对抗法国入侵，最后于7月11日在科特赖克（Kortrijk）的金马刺之战中取得胜利。今日在市集广场上仍然可见暴动领袖扬·布雷德尔（Jan Breydel）和彼得·德·科宁克（Pieter de Coninck）的雕像。\n14世纪，布鲁日布料贸易的重要性逐渐丧失。1384年来自勃艮第的菲利普二世成为了弗兰德伯爵，他在布鲁塞尔、里耳以及布鲁日设立了他的宫殿，这为布鲁日从全欧洲吸引到了大量的艺术家、银行家以及其他重要人士。布鲁日的主要活动逐渐转变为银行业、奢侈品交易以及文化中心。1376年于城堡广场建了新的市政厅。\n在此，新佛兰德派以其油画技巧驰名天下。世界上第一本印刷的英文书也是在布鲁日由威廉·卡克斯顿（William Caxton）印制。英王爱德华四世与理查三世都在此度过他们的放逐岁月。14世纪无疑地是布鲁日的黄金时代，人口从四万六千人升到1400年的最少12.5万（也许还飙到20万人，仅次于欧洲第一大城巴黎的28万人口），这个数目直到19世纪都没有再超越过。\n### 16世纪至今\n大约从1500年开始，连那条曾为布鲁日带来繁荣的兹温海道开始淤积，布鲁日作为经济龙头的地位很快就被安特卫普取代。17世纪时，蕾丝产业终止了，布鲁日仍想方设法要恢复旧日荣光。1650年代时英王查理二世的行宫以及流亡时的行馆都设在这里。他们将旧的港湾设施现代化了，也建立了新的运河通往海岸，但是并不成功。布鲁日渐渐贫困了并从欧洲的舞台上淡出。乔治·罗登巴克（Georges Rodenbach）曾将这个沉睡的城市称为「沉寂的布鲁日（Bruges-la-Morte）」，并出版了同名著作。该书引起了各国人士对布鲁日保存的文化和艺术宝藏的兴趣。\n19世纪下半叶，布鲁日成为世界第一批观光胜地之一，吸引了富有的英国与法国观光客。直到20世纪下半叶这个城市才开始渐渐找回过往的荣光。新港口泽布吕赫（Zeebrugge）建于1907年，在第一次世界大战时曾被德军用来停放U型潜艇，1970年代至1980年代早期，泽布吕赫港口扩建成为了欧洲最重要的现代化港口之一。20世纪末，国际观光业越来越蓬勃，在政府与市民的努力下，2000年布鲁日历史中心被联合国教科文组织登录为世界遗产，布鲁日也争取到了2002年欧洲文化之都的头衔。\n## 气候\n布鲁日位于沿海造地与内陆沙地的交界处，海拔相当低，属于海洋性气候。\n## 城区概述\n###古城\n布鲁日大部分建造于中世纪的建筑完好无损，使其成为欧洲保存最完好的中世纪城镇之一，目前历史中心是典型的中世纪古城，保存着大量中世纪至近代的建筑。早期哥特式建筑已经成为城市特色的一个部分。作为过去欧洲的重要贸易中心和文化中心，布鲁日和世界上其他地方有文化上的交集，比如布鲁日与早期尼德兰绘画流派（Flemish Primitives）有着密切的关系。\n其历史城区的范围由城墙划定。城墙始建于1297年，并在17世纪初建起了一系列棱堡（bastion）。城墙长6800米，围起了410公顷的区域。1275年起的规划直到18世纪仍能适合城市发展，但在1782年至1784年间，一些防御工事被拆除。在19世纪，城墙被改成散步场所，四座城门与一座防御塔（defence tower）留了下来。城市核心部分的发展主要围绕两个中心：其一是伯爵城堡（Burg of the counts），一个16公顷的四方小岛；其二是老城堡（Oude Burg）的商人住宅区。老城堡是12世纪时该城最初的发展中心。以前城墙的走向可由城内运河来看出。\n布鲁日城区有大量交错的小巷与一个接一个的广场，其中以城堡广场（Burg）和市集广场（Grand-Place）尤为著名。前者原先的标志性建筑是圣多纳廷主教座堂（the cathedral of Saint-Donatien，在1799年至1800年间被毁）与公爵住宅，之后被圣巴西略双小堂取代。一千年来，城堡广场一直被视为宗教与市政当局联合的象征，也是一些公共机构的所在地。而市集广场上则以大会堂、钟楼等居多，象征城市自治。城市中心大多为富贵人家居住，劳动者聚集在外围。\n进入19世纪后，人口的增长带来了绿地的分配。只有新剧场周围的区域经过奥斯曼（Haussmann）式改建（始于1864年）。布鲁日市区部分的特色之一是运河，部分遵循天然河道，部分人工挖出。当地人称之为“雷耶”（Reie，大约意为人工加固过的河道，类似于码头）。在布鲁日城墙内，也有一些绿地被保存下来，但最靠内陆的地方没有。许多花园和公园都属于宗教机构。同时流行的建筑主要是砖造哥特式建筑，以及一种独特的被称作“布鲁日跨度”（travée brugeoise）的建筑风格。这一风格与德国北部的砖造哥特式相似，但由于两者发展的不同，一般区别划分。此风格在16世纪早期便已成型，之后稍有变化，直到17世纪仍被使用，并成为19世纪重建时的主要灵感来源。\n###入选世界遗产\n2000年，联合国教育科学文化组织世界遗产委员会第24次会议决定将「布鲁日历史中心」其收入世界遗产名录，编号第996号:\n### 建筑\n####

位置境域\n\n无锡市位于北纬31°07′—32°02′，东经119°33′—120°38′之间，地处江苏省东南部、长江三角洲江湖间走廊部分。东邻苏州市，距上海市128千米；南与浙江省湖州市隔太湖相望；西南与安徽省宣城市、浙江省湖州市长兴县、安徽省广德市交界；西接常州市，西北距南京市183千米；北临长江，与泰州市代管的靖江市隔江相望。全市总面积4627.47平方千米，市区面积1643.88平方千米（其中城市建成区面积350平方千米），山区和丘陵面积3687.85平方千米、水域面积939.61平方千米\n。\n\n### 地形地貌\n\n无锡市境内以平原为主，星散分布着低山、残丘。无锡市南部为水网平原；北部为高沙平原；中部为低地辟成的水网圩田；西南部地势较高，为宜兴的低山和丘陵地区。宜兴市山体均作东西向延伸，绝对高度500米以上，最高峰为黄塔顶，海拔611.5米。江阴市和无锡市区的山丘总体上呈北东、北东东走向，其高度由西南往东北逐级下降；最高峰为惠山三茅峰，海拔328.98米。\n无锡市的地貌雏形，形成于中生年代印支期（约1.8亿年前）的华夏系构造，它使无锡市褶皱成陆。而燕山运动（约1.5亿—7000万年前）因强烈的火山活动和新块褶皱构造的形成，使原来比较稳定的基底又生新复活升高。喜马拉雅运动（约2500万年前）以差异性升降运动为主，在老构造的基础上，又加强了东西间褶皱和断裂，使江阴市、宜兴市一线以东形成了以现代太湖为中心的坳陷盆地，即太湖盆地\n。\n\n### 气候\n\n无锡市属北亚热带湿润季风气候区，四季分明，热量充足，降水丰沛，雨热同季。夏季受来自海洋的夏季季风控制，盛行东南风，天气炎热多雨；冬季受大陆盛行的冬季季风控制，大多吹偏北风；春、秋是冬、夏季风交替时期，春季天气多变，秋季秋高气爽。常年（1981—2010年统计资料）平均气温16.2℃，降水量1121.7毫米，雨日123天，日照时数1924.3小时，日照百分率43%。一年中最热是7月，最冷为1月。\n2020年，无锡市气温异常偏高，降水偏多，日照正常。冬春季气温持续偏高，冬季为自1955年有气象记录以来同期最暖，春季则仅次于2018年，为历史同期第二暖。夏季降水异常偏多，仅少于1999年和1991年，为历史同期第三多，特别是出现的超长梅雨，梅雨量达常年的3.1倍，为仅次于1991年的历史第二多年份，发生严重洪涝灾害；8月出现长时间持续高温天气；台风影响轻\n。\n\n### 水文\n\n无锡市地处江南水乡，位于长江中下游太湖流域，水网纵横，水系发达。无锡市有京杭大运河、梁溪河、锡北运河等诸多河流。京杭大运河自北向南贯穿无锡市中心，在运河公园处分为东、西两条支流。其中，西路为20世纪50年代新挖掘的京杭大运河主航道，东路为江南古运河。江南古运河由“一环一弄堂”格局组成，环绕无锡市中心。梁溪河自东向西穿过无锡市，注入太湖，被誉为无锡的“母亲河”。无锡市共有村级以上（长度150米以上）河道5635条，总长度7328.4千米；其中市区2193条，总长度3261.5千米\n。\n无锡市地处太湖北部的梅梁湖区域，被称为太湖明珠。太湖内湖蠡湖呈葫芦状嵌入无锡市区，由北向南逐渐变窄，其南部狭窄处被称为长广溪\n。\n\n## 自然资源\n\n### 水资源\n\n无锡市地表水较丰富，外来水源补给充足。市区储量为6349万立方米，年补给量为6453万立方米。其中，太湖总蓄水量为44.28亿立方米，年平均量约52亿立方米。\n\n### 生物资源\n\n植物：无锡市除栽培植物外，拥有自然分布于地区内以及外来归化的野生维管束植物共141科、497属、950种、75变种。占全国的比例为：植物科数39.94%、属数15.61%、种数3.5%。植物种类中，草本植物有744种，占总数的78.32%；木本植物（包括竹类）有206种，占总数的21.68%。主要用材林有竹、松、杉，优良用材的树种有杉木、檫树、樟树、紫楠、红楠、麻栎、锥栗、榆树等。药用植物400多种\n。\n动物：无锡市鸟类有170多种；鱼类为90多种，太湖中的银鱼，白鱼，长江中的刀鱼、鲥鱼、河豚是名贵鱼类；兽类有30多种，主要有华南兔、穿山甲、黄鼬等\n。\n\n### 矿产资源\n\n无锡市具有开采价值的矿产资源，以黏土矿、石灰石、大理石、玻璃用石英砂岩、建筑石等非金属矿为主，其次为煤、泥炭等可燃性矿产及矿泉水。黏土矿以陶土为主，已探明工业储量5000余万吨。石灰石估算储量17亿吨。大理石估算储量5000万立方米。煤探明工业储量4000余万吨\n。\n\n## 人口\n\n截至2020年11月，根据第七次全国人口普查结果，无锡市常住人口7462135人，占全省常住人口的比重为8.81%。\n截至2020年，无锡市全市有汉族、蒙古族、回族、藏族、维吾尔族、苗族、彝族、壮族、布依族、朝鲜族、满族、侗族、瑶族、白族、土家族、哈尼族、哈萨克族、傣族、黎族、傈僳族、低族、备族、高山族、拉枯族、水族、东乡族、纳西族、景颇族柯尔克孜族、土族、达斡尔族、么佬族、羌族、布朗族、撒拉族、毛南族、亿佬族、锡伯族、阿昌族、普米族、塔吉克族、怒族、俄罗斯族、鄂温克族、德昂族、保安族、裕固族、京族、塔塔尔族、独龙族、鄂伦春族、赫哲族、门巴族、基诺族54个民族。户籍人口中汉族占99.4%，少数民族占0.6%。\n截至2022年末，无锡市户籍人口519.01万人，年人口增长率7.27‰。户籍人口城镇化率86.61%。年末全市常住人口749.08万人，比上年增长0.15%，其中城镇常住人口622.39万人，比上年增长0.39%，常住人口城镇化率83.09%，比上年末提高0.2个百分点\n。\n\n## 经济\n\n### 综合\n\n无锡市为中国十五个经济中心城市之一，是中国近代民族工商业、乡镇企业、苏南模式的主要发源地，被称为小上海。无锡市农业产量高，为中国四大米市之一，有鱼米之乡之称；无锡市制造业强劲，是长三角地区主要的制造业基地，有物联网、集成电路、生物医药、纺织、新能源汽车等代表性产业\n；无锡市金融业、服务业发展迅速，居民消费支出较大\n。2021年，无锡市人均地区生产总值（人均GDP）18.74万元，连续两年位居中国大中城市首位\n。\n无锡市自古以来经济发达。从元代开始，无锡（时为无锡县）就成为了江南地区的漕运中心，形成了米码头、布码头、丝码头和钱码头4大码头。清光绪年间，荣氏兄弟、杨氏兄弟，以及周舜卿、祝大椿等民族资本家在无锡县置办纱厂、面粉厂等，使无锡县成为了中国近代民族工商业的发源地之一。沪宁铁路通车后，无锡县加快与上海特别市、苏州市、南京市等地融合，经济飞速发展，民国二十五年（1936），无锡县地区生产总值达7726万元，仅次于上海市、广州市，居全国第三位。无锡县因此有小上海之称  。\n中华人民共和国成立以后，无锡县升为无锡市，成为了中国重要的工业城市。1981年，无锡市被列为全国15个经济中心城市之一。1984年，无锡市被列为全国第一批13个较大城市之一。1985年，经国家批准，无锡市成为对外开放地区。改革开放以后，无锡市，尤其是无锡市代管的江阴市，开设了一批乡镇企业，成为了中国乡镇企业的发源地、苏南模式的主要应用地。江阴市的华西村，大力发展乡镇企业，开发旅游业，有天下第一村之称\n。\n在20世纪末21世纪初，无锡市地区生产总值（GDP）长期居全国前十位。无锡市实行对外开放战略，以经济外向化、产权多元化、运行市场化为主导，实施二次创业和转型，太阳能、新能源、微电子等新兴产业陆续成为无锡市的主要产业\n。2008年以后，无锡市经济运行遭遇困境。纺织业连年亏损；太阳能、光伏产业龙头企业面临破产；太湖蓝藻问题爆发，太湖周边地区农业、工业、旅游业发展受到抑制

"## 蒲城县\n蒲城县是中国陕西省渭南市所辖的一个县。蒲城县位于陕西关中平原东北部。面积1564平方公里。人口75万人（2004年）。县城位于县境中心。\n## 地理\n蒲城县地处渭河平原东北隅。东与大荔县、澄城县相邻；西接富平县；南与临渭区接壤；北依白水县、西北与铜川市相望。东西长52.8千米，南北宽47千米。位于东经109°20′17″至109°54′48″，北纬34°44′50″至35°10′30″之间。\n## 历史\n蒲城于战国秦孝公十二年（前350）始设县治，名“重泉”，故址在今钤铒乡政府驻地附近。乡政府西南至今有重泉村，传说因其地原有二泉，高低有别，上下相重，故名。\n秦时四邻：东北为征（在今西头乡），北为衙（在今白水县东北彭衙村），南为下部（原在今渭南市故县村，后迁至下吉镇），西邻频阳（在今富平县美原镇），东南接临晋（在今大荔县）。\n汉代南邻的下邽县，分为莲勺、下邽二县；北邻衙县、粟邑县（在今白水县西北）。汉末并征（在今西头乡）入重泉。\n北魏太和十一年（487），撤重泉改设南白水。西临土门县（今富平县），东临五泉县（今澄城县南部），东北为三门县（在今澄城县安里乡），北为白水县，南邻下邽、莲勺二县。西魏恭帝元年（554），改南白水县为蒲城县，除东邻为武乡县（今大荔县）外，余均未变。\n隋代，南临的莲勺县并入下邽县，西临的土门县并入华原县（今耀县以东），后复设土门县，东邻的武乡县改为冯翊县（在今大荔县）。\n唐开元四年（716），蒲城改为奉先县。元和初（806）将神泉乡划归富平。元和十五年（820），将美原县（原土门县）的龙原乡、栎阳县（在今临潼县东北栎阳镇）的万年乡划归奉先。长庆四年（824），将富平县的丰水乡、下邽县的翟公乡、澄城县的抚道乡、白水县的会宾乡等划归奉先。时除西邻的土门县改为美原县（在今富平美原镇）外，四邻均未变动。\n北宋开宝四年（971），奉先县复名“蒲城”，四邻无变动。\n元至元元年（1264），下邽县并入渭南，南邻为渭南县；美原县并入富平县，西邻为富平县。至元六年（1269），冯翊县改为同州，东南邻为同州（在今大荔县）。\n明清两代及民国时期，蒲城四邻无变动。据清光绪《蒲城县新志》记载：“蒲境东西一百里，南北八十里”。\n新中国成立后，于1952年划白水县的上张、东庄子、蒋家山、前吴家、后吴家、西吴、腰怀、老城、东庙庄、西庙庄、姚家村归蒲城。1958年12月合白水、澄城、蒲城三县为蒲城县，县址仍设原蒲城县址，并将蒲城县的永丰公社划归大荔。此时，蒲城东邻韩城（合阳县并入），东南邻大荔，南邻渭南，北邻洛川，西邻铜川市（富平县并入）。1961年8月又恢复蒲城、白水、澄城原建制，并将澄城县的苏家河、苏家坡、袁家坡、下尧科4个自然村划归蒲城，永丰公社辖地亦归回蒲城。1965年1月肖家堡公社由铜川市划归蒲城。1980年元月，又将肖家堡、阿庄、广阳、高楼河4个公社全部划归铜川市。\n##

历史沿革\n\n县名源于蒙古语“多伦诺尔”，意为“七个湖”，因曾有七水泊而得名。行政建制始于清代，曾为口北三厅之一，称多伦诺尔宣抚理事厅。\n1691年，清朝康熙皇帝举行了著名的“多伦诺尔会盟”，漠北蒙古正式归附清朝中央政府，改变了当时东北亚的政治格局。\n1710年（康熙四十九年），清政府直隶省在多伦诺尔设立“兴化镇”，隶属于直隶省管辖。\n1732年（雍正十年），设立归化城理事厅和多伦诺尔理事厅。多伦诺尔理事厅作为直隶省最北的行政司法机构，直接管辖的行政地域包括多伦诺尔城、察哈尔左翼正蓝旗、正白旗、镶白旗、镶黄旗近两万多平方公里。司法诉讼管理范围涉及内外蒙古130多旗，成为代表朝廷在内外蒙古广大地区直接行使权力的地方政府。\n1881年（光绪七年），清政府改多伦诺尔理事厅为多伦诺尔抚民厅，管理察哈尔左翼四旗辖境内的一切行政事务。\n1913年（民国二年），民国政府废多伦诺尔抚民厅，设为多伦县。\n1914年（民国三年），民国设立察哈尔特别区，多伦县是仅次于该行政区首府张家口的第二大城市。\n1928年（民国十七年），察哈尔特别行政区改省，多伦县为该省第二大城市。\n1945年8月，苏蒙联军打败日军，苏蒙联军在多伦城区设立多伦苏维埃市，下辖多伦诺尔旗。\n1949年5月撤销多伦市建制，改设城关区。同年10月多伦县政府改称多伦县人民政府。\n1950年8月，根据中央政府内务部决定，多伦县划归内蒙古自治区，隶属察哈尔盟。\n1958年10月，锡林郭勒盟和察哈尔盟合并，撤销察哈尔盟建制，多伦县隶属锡林郭勒盟。\n2011年9月29日，锡盟南部区域中心城市选址工作汇报会在多伦县召开，会议一致通过选址多伦县建设锡盟南部区域中心城市。\n\n##

特色餐饮\n\n莜面\n多伦民间有段顺口溜说:“多伦莜面捣烧酒，山珍海味都不如，莜面小酒品美味，香得人们口水流。”\n莜面的营养价值非常高。莜麦的蛋白质、脂肪、维生素及钙、铁、磷等矿物质的含量在同类粮食作物中最高，而且莜麦含糖量低。\n滦河全鱼宴\n“滦河全鱼宴”指整桌菜肴全部以滦河鲜鱼为主要原料，经过烧、烤、烹、煮、煎、炸、炖等多种方式，烹饪而成的宴席。品种主要有：鲫鱼、鲤鱼、鲢鱼、草鱼、鲶鱼、武昌鱼、大银鱼、雅罗鱼（俗称华子鱼）等。\n苦菜\n苦菜是一种药用食用兼具的无毒野生植物，一年生草本，药名叫“败酱草”，民间俗称苦菜。多伦苦菜属沙地苦菜，其抗旱能力较强。\n黄花\n黄花既是一种名贵的菜肴，又是一种价值很高的中草药。它含有蛋白质、多种维生素及碳水化合物。多伦的黄花主要分布在县城以北的地区。\n蘑菇\n多伦的野生蘑菇富含蛋白质、氨基酸、多种矿物质，其营养价值比一般蔬菜、水果要高，是纯天然无污染的健康食品。\n蕨菜\n又叫如意菜。生长在内蒙古地区的很多地方。春季生出嫩叶，卷曲如拳，有黄色羽状复叶。。多伦蕨菜主要产在北部地区。\n沙棘\n沙棘是一种野生药食用植物，为中国传统蒙、藏药和中药的常用药，有利于免疫，防治心脑血管疾病。\n手扒肉\n手扒肉是蒙古族传统的食肉方法之一，因食用时不用筷子而得名。斟酒敬客，吃手扒肉，是草原牧人表达对客人敬重和爱戴之情的传统方式。\n烤全羊\n蒙古族烤全羊是热情好客的蒙古族人民庆祝重大节日和婚娶等喜庆之日款待尊贵客\n烤全羊\n人的传统食品。“全羊”必须是绵羊，以二三岁的羯羊为上品。只用不带蹄子的四肢(两条前腿各带四条肋骨)、腰背部和尾巴、胸腔骨和去掉下颌的头。吃时，通常要配几盘热菜、牛羊肉内脏做的冷盘和奶食品。\n蒙古锅茶\n对蒙古人来说，奶茶已不是单纯意义上的饮用品，而是一种文化，一种情感。蒙古锅茶主要先用传统方法将奶茶熬好，然后加入风干肉、奶酪、奶皮子等在锅中边吃边煮。\n奶豆腐\n也称奶干。把鲜奶放置发酵后，撇取上层白油，再倒入锅里煮熬。等奶子呈糊状，装入刻有各种图案的木模中，压制成块放通风处晾干即成。\n炒米\n又称“蒙古米”。呈黄色。由于炒米具有方便、快捷又特别耐饥的特点，因而成为蒙古族生活、生产、旅行中不可短缺的食品。\n\n##

历史沿革\n\n夏代天下分为九州，平定属冀州。\n西周初年，冀州分为幽、并二州，平定县属并州。周成王时，灭唐国，封其弟叔虞于唐地，平定县地在唐国东境，至叔虞之子指晋水名国，平定县属晋国。\n战国时期，韩赵魏三家分晋，平定成为赵国属地。\n秦始皇统一六国后，分天下为三十六郡，平定属太原郡。\n汉承秦制，至汉武帝时，始置上艾县，县治今张庄镇新城村，仍归属太原郡，后改为“石艾”。这是平定境内最早的设县治所。\n东汉末年，郡国并行，冀州之域分为三郡六国，平定属常山国（今河北省元氏县西北）。\n三国时，属并州乐平郡（今昔阳）。\n北魏建国元年（386年），改上艾为石艾；太平真君九年（448年），又恢复上艾之名。\n隋代初年，该县属辽州（今昔阳县西南），不久划归并州太原郡。\n唐代时，该县曾为京畿道属县，武德三年（620年）归辽州；武德六年（623年）划归受州（今阳泉市赛鱼）；贞观八年（634年）废受州，石艾直属太原府；天宝元年（742年），更名广阳，将县治迁至广阳村（今属昔阳县）。\n五代十国时期，战争连绵，广阳先后为后梁、后唐、北汉所辖。五代时期，本县属北汉。\n北宋初年，宋军攻取北汉，首先攻下广阳。公元979年，广阳县改为平定县，并迁县治于今上城，营造了大城中套小城的上下重城。\n金代时，平定升为州，属太原支郡，领平定、乐平二县。\n元代，平定州属冀宁路太原府。\n明代，冀宁路改为冀宁道，仍归太原府。\n清代，平定州升为直隶州，属省辖，领寿阳、乐平、盂县三县。\n民国初年，改直隶州为县，属冀宁道。\n民国二十六年（1937年）10月，日军入侵平定，大好河山遭蹂躏。铁路、公路沿线驻有重兵。为抵抗日军，中国共产党领导人民建立抗日根据地，平定开始一分为三。以正太铁路为界，路北建立了平定（路北）县抗日民主政府，属晋察冀边区；路南以平辽公路为界，建成立了平东、平西两个抗日民主政府，属晋冀鲁豫边区。\n民国三十四年（1945年），抗日战争胜利后，平东、平西两县合并为平定（路南）县。\n民国三十六年（1947年）5月2日，平定县全境解放，民国三十七年（1948年）8月，路南、路北两个县政府合并，成立了平定县人民政府，属榆次专区。\n1958年8月，平定县撤销，归入阳泉市，称为郊区。\n1961年4月，又重新恢复平定县建置，属晋中专区。\n1983年9月，平定县改为阳泉市属县。\n\n2001年，撤销南坳镇、维社乡，并入城关镇，更名为冠山镇；撤销古贝乡、南阳胜乡，并入张庄镇；撤销马山乡、潺泉乡，并入东回镇；撤销柏井乡、槐树铺乡，合并设立柏井镇，原槐树铺乡的旧关、新关等村并入娘子关镇；撤销岩会乡，并入巨城镇；撤销黄统岭乡，并入岔口乡。区划调整后，全县辖8个镇、2个乡：冠山镇、冶西镇、锁簧镇、张庄镇、东回镇、柏井镇、娘子关镇、巨城镇、石门口乡、岔口乡。县政府驻冠山镇。\n\n##

历史文化\n\n方言\n\n平定镇通行粤语—化州话。\n\n地名来源\n\n化州西北与广西北流陆川连界，古时这里山高林密，每有狼瑶兵、山寇潜入抢劫。明代中期，朝廷便于化州博二都扼两广（广东、广西）交通要冲处设堡驻兵以震慑防卫，取“平定瑶兵、山寇”之意，命名为“平定堡”。后博二都驻地平安圩亦改名平定圩。平定镇名便源于此。\n\n平定圩古又称“屋角头”，因其历来边贸生意兴旺，地主官僚、州官百姓、黑白两道、商家巨贾都在此设置驿站商铺，各方势力交织，相互制衡。尽管土匪山贼经常对两广过往客商强抢豪夺，但人员货物只要能顺利进入圩之“屋角头”就会平安无事，故圩曾名平安圩，又称“屋角头”。以圩名得镇名。\n\n##

历史沿革\n\n### 名称由来\n\n清光绪十八年（1892年），钦加盐运使衔署镇边直隶抚彝府即补正堂王右下山照封李通明为“西盟土目”，西盟一名始见。西盟一名历来含义有三种说法。一说，西盟为拉祜族语，“西”为金子，“盟”为地方，即产金子的地方。二说，西盟即立盟誓约得名。清同治年间拉祜族首领三佛祖从澜沧移佛教，护教上清政府统治较薄弱地方西盟，借佛教掩护，以神灵化身出现，于佛殿山盖佛房、建白塔，并从怒江、丽江、临沧、澜沧和缅甸的勐班柯、勐兴威请来拉祜族、傈僳等若干部落几千户，由三佛祖召集本地和外来的大小头领于佛房烧香磕头，求神拜佛，歃血盟誓，确立了三佛祖为首领的氏族部落领主政教合一的政权，从而统治西盟。三佛祖二世李通明继位，仍利用佛房立盟誓约，并以武力向外扩地，同时举行一年一度烟会，对外扩大影响，巩固其统治，势力渐大，故名西盟。三说，西盟是传教的地方，西盟一名的由佛教经典中“须弥”术语之转音，“须弥”曾经写为“西明”，后写为“西盟”。以上三种说法，多倾向于第一种说法。\n\n### 建制沿革\n\n西盟地区西汉时，为古代傣族联盟国家“勐达光”（汉译“哀牢国”）属地。\n东汉永平十二年（69年），哀牢国归附汉朝、其地设永昌郡，永昌郡由汉朝派郡守与“诏达光”（哀牢王）共同治理；建初元年（76年），诏达光与汉朝郡守发生矛盾、起兵反汉，汉朝军队与“勐达光”军队多次激战，部分傣族先民为躲避战乱、迁至哀牢国南境与各种蛮族部落杂错而居；今西盟地得到进一步开发。\n西晋元康九年（299年），晋朝所辖永昌郡不韦县（今隆阳、施甸、昌宁等地）境内的傣族起兵反晋，永昌郡治由不韦县迁至永寿县（今镇康、永德、耿马、沧源等地），同时在永寿县南部增设南涪县（今西盟、澜沧、孟连、勐海、景洪等地）；今西盟地属永昌郡南涪县。\n东晋元熙二年（420年），东晋灭亡，之后的南朝宋、齐、梁中国内地王朝逐步退出云南高原，陈（南朝）代梁（南朝）后，中国内地王朝彻底放弃云南高原；今西盟地的傣族先民以“勐”（盆地）为单位、各自形成独立小邦，为倮黑部地。\n南诏赞普钟十一年（762年），南诏国在勐掌（保山盆地）设永昌节度、统辖澜沧江以西地区；今西盟地属永昌节度。\n大理天授元年（1096年），大理国废节度、都督等军事辖区，调整为八府、四郡、四镇；今西盟地先属永昌节度、后属永昌府。\n大理天定三年（1254年），大蒙古国灭大理国后，忙于攻打南宋，无暇顾及大理国偏远地区；今西盟地的傣族首领据地自治。至元二十六年（1289年），元朝（前大蒙古国）大理金齿等处宣抚司在孟定路东南设木连路；今西盟地属木连路。天历元年（1328年），元朝分大理金齿等处宣慰司都元帅府所辖的木连路、银沙罗甸设银沙罗甸等处宣慰司都元帅府；今西盟地属银沙罗甸等处宣慰司都元帅府。\n至正八年（1348年），“勐卯”（瑞丽江河谷盆地）崛起的傣族联盟国家“勐卯龙”（汉译“麓川国”）吞并银沙罗甸等处宣慰司；今西盟地属麓川国。至正十五年（1355年），麓川国归附元朝、其控制区域设平缅宣慰司；今西盟地属平缅宣慰司、仍由麓川国君长节制。\n洪武十七年（1384年），麓川国归附明朝、其控制区域设麓川平缅宣慰司；今西盟地属麓川平缅宣慰司、仍由“勐卯龙”君长节制。永乐四年（1406年），明朝分麓川平缅宣慰司地设孟琏长官司（辖今萨尔温江以东的掸邦地及澜沧江以西的澜沧、孟连、西盟等地）；今西盟县境属孟琏长官司。宣德三年（1428年），麓川平缅宣慰司脱离明朝、恢复麓川国；正统四年（1439年），麓川国东征兼并孟琏长官司；今西盟县境又属麓川国。\n正统六年（1441年）、正统七年（1442年）、正统十三年（1448年），明朝三征麓川，孟琏长官司复置，今西盟县境属孟琏长官司。正德十六年（1521年）以后，孟琏长官司废置\n；万历十三年（1585年），孟琏土官归附明朝、复设孟琏长官司；万历三十四年（1606年），孟琏土官归附东吁王朝；今西盟县境随孟琏土官一起夹在明朝与东吁王朝之间。\n康熙元年（1662年），孟琏土官归附清朝、其控制区域设孟连长官司，隶永昌府；今西盟县境属孟连长官司。康熙四十八年（1709年），孟连长官司升级为孟连宣抚司，隶永昌府；今西盟县境属孟连宣抚司。乾隆二十九年（1764年），孟连宣抚司由永昌府划予顺宁府；今西盟县境仍属孟连宣抚司。\n嘉庆四年（1799年）以后，孟连宣抚司北境、勐勐巡检司南境的倮黑人逐渐脱离傣族土司掌控，武装夺取傣族土司的领地；光绪十四年（1888年），清朝出兵平定倮黑人后，将孟连宣抚司北境八土目辖地和勐勐巡检司析出设直隶镇边抚夷厅、由内地派出直隶同知管辖；光绪十七年（1891年），耿马宣抚司所属的勐董、勐角土目与耿马土司发生仇杀事件后，勐董、勐角由耿马宣抚司划归直隶镇边抚夷厅；光绪十八年（1892年），倮黑五佛主暴动，清朝镇压过程中招降“三佛主”李通明，承认他为西盟土目，划归直隶镇边抚夷厅；光绪二十年（1894年），孟连宣抚司由顺宁府划归直隶镇边抚夷厅，所属上允土把总、下允土千总析出由直隶镇边抚夷厅直辖，今西盟县境属直隶镇边抚夷厅。\n\n民国二年（1913年），民国政府裁直隶镇边抚夷厅、改设镇边县。\n民国四年（1915年），镇边县改为澜沧县。\n民国十八年（1929年），设西盟区，澜沧县将辖地土目、土司辖地归并为10个区，选择区内势力较大的土目、土司担任区长。属澜沧县为西盟县佐。\n民国二十一年（1932年），按山川行便调整为8个区，打乱土目、土司的管辖范围。属澜沧县为西盟区，区公所驻芒东。\n民国二十八年（1939年），改称西盟乡，隶属澜沧县，辖十余保，西盟保驻西盟。\n民国二十九年（1940年），澜沧县废区、改划为13乡2镇，式微的土目、土司被纳入乡镇保甲制以内；今西盟县境属澜沧县。\n1949年，澜沧解放，成立临时军政委员会期间，属澜沧县称西盟区，区政府驻拉巴，辖7个武装工作点。\n1950年，设立西盟区政府，隶属澜沧县。\n1956年6月，成立西盟佤族自治县筹备委员会。10月，澜沧县所属的西盟山区划出、设立西盟县。\n1965年3月，西盟县改为西盟佤族自治县；西盟佤族自治县下设1个镇（西盟镇），7个区（马散区、新厂区、中课区、力所区、勐梭区、翁嘎科区、岳宋区）。\n\n## 行政区划\n\n### 区划沿革\n\n1988年，区改乡、乡改村，西盟县调整为1个镇（西盟镇），7个乡（新厂乡、中课乡、岳宋乡、力所拉祜族乡、勐梭乡、翁嘎科乡、莫窝乡）。\n\n1996年，省人民政府批准傈僳拉祜族乡复名为力所拉祜族乡。\n\n2000年，西盟县政府由西盟镇迁至勐梭乡，勐梭乡改为勐梭镇；西盟县辖2个镇（西盟镇、勐梭镇），6个乡（新厂乡、中课乡、岳宋乡、力所拉祜族乡、翁嘎科乡、莫窝乡）。\n2006年，西盟镇和莫窝乡合并为勐卡镇；西盟县辖2个镇（勐梭镇、勐卡镇），5个乡（翁嘎科乡、力所拉祜族乡、岳宋乡、新厂乡、中课乡）。\n2013年，中课乡、新厂乡、翁嘎科乡分别撤乡设镇；西盟县辖5个镇（勐梭镇、勐卡镇、中课镇、新厂镇、翁嘎科镇），2个乡（力所拉祜族乡、岳宋乡）。\n\n### 区划详情\n\n截至2016年，西盟佤族自治县辖5个镇，2个乡。政府驻勐梭镇。\n\n## 地理环境\n\n### 位置境域\n\n西盟佤族自治县位于云南省西南部，思茅市西部的阿佤山区，全境地跨东经99°18′至99°43′，北纬22°25′至22°57′之间，其东、东北、东南部与澜沧拉祜族自治县接壤，南部与孟连傣族拉祜族佤族自治县相接，西、西北部与缅甸联邦共和国山水相依，国境线长达89.33公里，县城驻地距省会昆明864公里，距思茅293公里，境内东西横距40公里，南北纵距60公里，总面积1353.57平方公里。\n\n### 地质\n\n西盟佤族自治县地质结构多样，具有古生代到新生代的各种地层。新老地层交错，断裂强烈，褶皱明显，构造复杂。\n\n下古生界上段时期形成的云母片岩、石英片岩、片麻岩，主要分布于南锡河、南康河、新厂河两岸的莫窝、岳宋、翁嘎科、傈僳等乡的低河谷地带；中段时期形成的大理石、白云石、片麻岩，主要分布海拔1200-1800米左右的地区；下段时期形成的含电气石条状变粒岩分布于海拔1000米以上的半山地区。\n\n上三叠系至朱罗系时期形成的红色砂石、泥岩、夹灰岩、砾岩，主要分布于勐梭乡东部和中课乡大部地区。奥陶系至志留系时期形成的灰白色石英岩、页岩、板岩、砾岩；二叠系下流的灰岩、白云质灰岩、页岩、褐铁矿、硅质岩、玄武岩；石灰系的基性火山岩，集中分布在中课至勐梭乡秧洛村以上接近澜沧的部分地区。\n\n### 地形地貌\n\n西盟佤族自治县地处怒山山脉南段，主要有西盟山脉、拉斯龙山脉、盘龙山脉，均为南北走向。地形复杂，全县除勐梭镇有一块3000余亩的河谷川坝外，其余均为山区。境内山峦叠嶂，沟壑纵横，最高海拔2458.9米，最低海拔590米（县境西南边缘格弄秧河与南卡江汇合处）。\n\n西盟佤族自治县属唐古拉山和怒山山脉南段展布尾端的中高山丘陵深切割峡谷地带。地形呈半岛状纺锤形。地势东北高、西南低，山脉南北走向。由于受南康河及境内各支流的切割影响，呈现明显的剥蚀构造地形，按海拔高低，全县可分为河谷区、半山区、山区三种地形类型。\n\n西盟佤族自治县东部有哈朵柯、磨楷、考底、兑本、大布都山等，呈南北走向，峰峦起伏，沟壑深邃，森林茂密，水源丰富，一般海拔在1800-2200米之间。西部有土龙美、土楼罗、土埂堵、土埂干、土鲁归山等，呈东西走向，一般海拔1000-1600米之间。南部有大黑山、大黄山、那丙梁子、班弄梁子等，呈东西走向，山脉河谷相间，排列紧密，一般海拔1000米-1600米之间。北部有土昂洛、土朋伐、冈窝少、土多考、哦闷的科、三棵树、考翁山等，呈东南至西北走向，一般海拔1800-100米之间。主要名山有大黑山、土克压、佛殿山、当归山、倮铁科山。著名的山梁有西盟山梁、拉斯陇山梁、盘龙山梁和班母山梁。\n\n### 气候\n\n西盟佤族自治县受孟加拉湾西南暖湿气流影响，属亚热带海洋性季风气候。由于相对高差达1869.9米，立体气候明显，降水量丰富，年均降水量2758.3毫米，最高年（1991年）达3426.7毫米。年平均气温15.3℃，无霜期319天。年均日照2204.7小时，辐射量每平方厘米131.8千卡。风速年平均2.5米/秒。夏秋季节雨量高度集中，降水量占全年的90.1%，冬春季节雨量偏少，占9.9%。\n\n###

军事边防\n\n清光绪二十年正月二十四日（1894年3月1日），《中英续议滇缅界务条款》第三条，仅初步划定尖高山以南（北纬25°35’以南）为佧佤山区的中缅边界线。光绪二十三年正月三日（1897年2月4日），中英又签订《中英滇缅界务商务续议附款》，重申佧佤山区的中缅边界问题，明确了上述界线。但自南定河与南帕河汇合处起至怒江与南卡江汇合处止的一段界线，即临沧地区的耿马、沧源，思茅地区的澜沧、盂连、西盟并不详尽。光绪二十五、二十六年（1899年、1900年），中英举行滇缅南段未定界第一次会勘，英方首席代表司格德自划一线，称司格德自划线，谈判不欢而散。清政府所划的“部示线”成为临时界线。\n\n民国二十三年（1934年）冬，英军武装入侵班洪，遭到李希哲组织的“西南民众义勇自卫队”的沉重打击。由于武力侵犯未得逞．英政府便转向对国民政府施加压力，迫使国民政府同英方举行滇缅南段未定界第二次会勘。民国二十四年（1935年）冬，中英第二次滇缅南段未定界会勘开始。会谈中，英方无理提出“以孔明山为界”，向“部示线”以东扩张200余平方公里。中方提出以“公明山为界”。\n\n民国三十年（1941年）6月18日，中英双方代表就中缅南段未定界在重庆进行会谈。英国趁日本侵略中国之危，提出截断中方的抗日供给线——滇缅公路为要挟，迫使中华民国政府划了一条“1941年线”为临时中缅南段未定界线，中缅边界最终未得到解决。\n\n1952年12月9日，中国人民解放军进驻西盟佤山，人民解放军到达西盟后，继续追歼残敌至中缅未定界“1941年线”。\n\n1956年1-6月，中缅边界勘界委员会第二勘察团，对中缅未定界西盟段进行考察。同年11月9日，中缅两国政府发表《新闻公报》，28日，西盟驻军和地方工作人员全部撤出中缅未定界“1941年线”以西地区。\n\n1960年1月，中缅两国政府签订《关于中华人民共和国缅甸联邦共和国边界问题协定》。根据此协定，中缅未定界在未正式划定前，由双方组成边界联合勘察队进行实地勘察。中缅南段未定界的西盟段，双方于1960年7月28日至9月15日．完成全部实地勘察任务。\n1960年10月1日，《中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦政府边界条约》在北京签订，根据《中缅边界协定》，中缅两国政府派出勘界组，对中缅边界西盟段全线走向进行联合勘察和竖桩工作，为了保护勘界人员的安全，先后粉碎国民党军残部武装窜扰。\n\n中缅边界西盟段全长89.33公里，以河为界69.815公里，以山为界19.515公里。起点自土邦美山的1938高地，终点至南卡江与格浪秧河交界处，共竖6个号9棵界桩（178-183号界碑）。\n\n1978年1月，组建西盟边防工作站，先后设立5个边防工作站。1980年1月1日，组建西盟边防武警大队。\n\n##

历史文化\n\n### 民俗节庆\n\n* 佛房新米节\n\n佛房新米节是每年的农历八月十五日。在这天之前，各村寨家家户户吃新米，都要留一碗新米，由村寨头人收集拢后，派人送到西盟佛房。八月十五日这一天，佛房鸣炮三响，拜祭月亮佛爷咏经直达通宵。\n* 祭祀大石马\n\n每年三月十五日，拉祜族男女老少身着盛装，敲锣打鼓，台着祭供品，吹着芦笙到大巴马机会拜祭大石马。\n* 佛房开印节\n\n每年腊月十五，是佛房开印节，佛祖大印平时是佛祖珍藏，任何人都不得看见。开印节这天，佛祖把大印拿出来，摆到神台上让大家都能看到。参加开印节活动的佛爷、教徒、各族群众欢庆歌舞，统一休息一天。\n* 赕佛节\n\n每年的正月初九是佛房赕佛节。这天，各村群众从四面八方前来西盟佛房赕佛，所来之人都必须带一份礼物作为供品拜祭神佛。祭祀后，在佛房大院广场跳舞娱佛。活动持续三天，第三天才各自回家。\n* 关印节\n\n农历正月十五是西盟佛房关印节。这天，各村寨歌舞娱乐休息一天，过关印节。第二天，集中到西盟佛房拜佛，拜祭完毕，佛祖收起佛印，然后那出一些谷种和糯米粑粑分赠给拜祭的众人，并由佛房出资杀猪、磨豆腐、做饭招待拜佛众人一餐，关印节结束。\n* 葫芦节\n\n“葫芦节”是拉祜族全民族的盛大节日，每年农历的十月十五，拉祜族人民身着节日盛装，载歌载舞，带着自酿的美酒和糯米粑粑，杀猪宰鸡，集中在寨子载歌载舞，开始一年一度的庆祝活动。\n\n* 哈巴节\n\n哈巴，即拉祜语“月亮节”，也称“祭月节”。每年八月十五日的晚上，拉祜山寨人们带着新米、干巴、烟叶、新鲜瓜果、甘蔗等祭品拥向佛房进行集体祭月活动。“扒母八”（佛爷）在佛房内挂一幅“炕笆”大的白布，白布上绘有月亮的图形，下方设一张大供桌及香烛蜡台。祭月的人将祭品献于供桌上，点香烛、烧纸钱，对月亮图形跪拜叩首，听佛爷颂经祈祷。\n* 祭月\n\n集体的祭月活动结束后，便开始了各家各户的祭月。人们将装满祭品的蔑桌拾到屋外高高的山岗上，在老人的带领下向月亮跪拜三次，将新米、铜锅酒洒向天空。人们围着蔑桌，吹响芦笙，跳起摆舞，欢庆丰收的喜悦。临走时，一人拿一个梨，象征与丰收幸福永不分离。\n\n### 民族风情\n\n西盟佤族是最早世居于阿佤山中心区的民族。自称“瓦”、“安瓦”、“布饶克”、“勒瓦”等。“瓦”、“安瓦”、“布饶克”意为住在山上的人，“勒瓦”意为看守大门的人。民国时期，当地汉族、拉祜族、傣族称“阿瓦”。中华人民共和国成立后，本着各民族一律平等原则，根据本民族的意愿，报经国务院批准，1963年正式定名为佤族。\n\n* 司岗里\n\n佤族的起源，在佤族中广泛流传着“司岗里”的传说，佤语“司岗”是石洞，“里”是出来，意为人是从石洞里出来的，此石洞位于今缅甸岩城区巴格岱大寨附近的一片原始森林里，距西盟县城30余公里。至今佤族仍把他视为“圣地”，在宗教活动或背诵寨史、家谱时，都要把“司岗里”紧密联系起来，“司岗里”的传说，各地解释大同小异，但西盟的佤族都把他视为人类祖先的发祥地。\n* 藤索桥\n\n藤索桥，是西盟佤族、拉祜族在江、河通道上搭建的桥梁，过去用结实粗大的树藤作索引，用竹、木枝杈作栅栏，中间搭上几优木头相互连接建成。西盟南康河、锡古河、南锡河、南卡江上都有这一类桥梁。\n\n* 木鼓房\n\n佤语称木鼓为“克罗”，是佤族的通天神器，木鼓是中国56个民族中特有的一个鼓种，是母系氏族社会典型的女性生殖崇拜，是佤族山寨的保护神。佤寨每逢木鼓节、新火节、新水节、新米节等宗教节日都有敲起木鼓、唱歌跳舞娱乐的习俗。是佤族原始自然崇拜中视为至高无上的通天神器，是万能之神莫伟的化身，是佤族山寨的保护神。每个村寨至少有一个木鼓房，有的桂冠一个族姓就设一个木鼓房。因此，有的一个村寨就有多个木鼓房的现象。\n过去，佤族猎人头祭木鼓，木鼓房旁有很有盛人头的人头桩，1958年以后，国家禁止猎人头祭木鼓，用畜、兽头取而代之。\n\n* 佤族民居\n\n佤族民居为竹木结构、草屋顶“杆栏”式建筑，楼上住人，楼下堆柴火或养畜禽。佤族民居因生活的地域或支系不同而在房屋装饰上有所区别。\n\n## 风景名胜\n\n* 木依吉神谷景区\n\n木依吉神谷景区主要景观有“榕树”、“木依吉神像”、“岩画”、“人头桩”、五“神潭”等。位于西盟县城城南、勐梭龙潭附近的密林中。距县城约五公里。\n\n* 里坎瀑布\n\n里坎是傣语的发音，意为猴子经常玩耍的地方。里坎瀑布景区内有雄伟壮观的里坎瀑布、惊险刺激的佤族藤索桥和极具药用价值的砂仁林。位于西盟县东北，勐梭镇里坎寨子附近，距县城约5公里。\n\n* 勐梭龙潭\n\n勐梭龙潭为天然淡水湖泊，湖面海拔1170米，近似蘑菇状，面积580亩，蓄水量500万立方米，最深37米，平均深度11.5米，年平均水温23度。\n* 佤山榕树王\n\n佤山榕树王位于澜沧县至西盟县公路-募西线K48公里处，距新县城约12公里。榕树高约60余米、树冠直径长约100米、下垂气生根20多棵，宽幅达50多米，形成别具特色的独树成林景观。\n\n## 所获荣誉\n\n2018年9月25日，获得商务部“2018年电子商务进农村综合示范县”荣誉称号\n。\n2020年5月14日，被认定为云南首批省级全域旅游示范区。\n\n2020年7月29日，全国爱卫会决定命名西盟佤族自治县为2017-2019周期国家卫生县城。\n\n2021年4月，入选第二批全国农作物病虫害“绿色防控示范县”创建推评名单。\n\n2021年12月，被云南省教育厅拟评为“云南省教育工作合格县”。\n\n2022年5月，入选第五届云南省文明城市候选名单。",

历史文化\n\n### 特色文化\n\n梨花大鼓\n梨花大鼓早期叫“犁铧大鼓”，因演唱者手持犁铧片伴奏而得名（现用月牙铜板伴奏）。梨花大鼓起源于清光绪年间。主要流传于河北省南部。风格朴实，运字行腔声情并，唱腔丰富多变，素有腔多字少七十二哼哼之称，曲调高亢，说、唱、道、白兼备，叙事抒情交融，以说为主，唱为辅（中长篇书较多），有慢板（哭调）、紧板、匀板，句式有十字韵、七字韵等。多诉说民间疾苦和农家故事。主要传统书目有：《海公案》《响马传》《刘大哥劝老婆》等。主要伴奏乐器：三弦、铜板、京鼓。2008年，鸡泽梨花大鼓被列为国家级非物质文化遗产第一批扩展项目，同时被列为河北省非物质文化遗产。\n弦子腔调\n弦子腔又称瞪筋戏，是鸡泽县独有的地方剧种，约产生于清嘉庆年间，它是丝弦剧种的前身。弦子腔戏比丝弦唱腔更为复杂，它属于梆子腔戏。曲腔高亢明亮，旋律流畅，特别是句后的拖腔上跳下滑，前直反假、前后呼应，具有独特的艺术风格。有慢板、快板、散板、流水板、二板、头板、反调（哇哇调）、哚口叙、二宫调等众曲目。伴奏乐器较多，角色行当齐全。主要的传统剧目有《骂殿》《反云南》《下河西》等。2007年被列为河北省非物质文化遗产。\n织字土布\n土布又称称“精布”。是纯棉手工提花纺织品，有“二匹缯”“四匹缯”“五架山”“七架山”等众多种类。二十世纪七十年代，鸡泽农村家庭纺织业达到了兴盛时期，家家都有一台织布机，户户能独立进行纺、浆、经、涮、织、染等全套工序。人们在纺织工艺上进行了改革和发展，创造出许多织染工艺精细的产品，如有“土布词语”“土布对联”“印染花布”等，丰富了土布图案变化，织字土布多为农家女结婚自用。2007年，被列为河北省非物质文化遗产。\n\n### 县名由来\n\n鸡泽在古代不是县名，而是个自然的沼泽地名。鸡泽地处位于黑龙港流域的古沙河、名河冲积扇，和漳河故道冲积扇交汇处，地势低洼，形成沼泽。又因沼泽地鱼虾草虫较多，非常适宜鸡鸭放养。于是，户户养鸡，出现了鸡鸭遍地的景象。“井丘联比，可以盈泽，鸡以氏泽、泽曰鸡泽”。《春秋·襄公三年》：“同盟于鸡泽。”古鸡泽在今鸡泽县东十千米处的旧城营村。据《寰宇通志》卷5广平国鸡泽县：“取界内鸡泽为名。”鲁襄公三年（公元前570年）晋悼公大会诸侯于此（旧城营村北有会盟台遗址）。见于史书《春秋经》，称“鸡泽晋地”（晋，今山西省晋城东南），属晋侯辖区。\n\n### 历史人物\n\n毛遂自荐\n毛遂是战国时代赵国平原君的门客。秦兵攻打赵国，平原君奉命到楚国求救，毛遂主动请求跟着去。到了楚国，平原君跟楚王谈了一上午没有结果。毛遂挺身而出，陈述利害，楚王才答应派春申君带兵去救赵国。\n毛遂及其后人\n毛遂，战国时期赵国（河北省鸡泽县毛官营村）人，平原君上客谏议大夫，纵横家鬼谷子的关门弟子，又是高徒。前257年，秦围赵国都城邯郸。国难当头，毛遂自荐请缨随平原君出使楚国。当合纵未决时，毛遂按剑数语，气吞云梦，说服楚王并与之歃血为盟，“三寸之舌，胜百万雄师”成为千古美谈。\n毛遂的后人中出现了许多人才和英雄，其中较有成就和影响力的是毛亨、毛苌。他们俩保存、编注并传授《诗经》，后人赞其“义炳如日星”，毛苌并享奉文庙。《诗经》是中国古代第一部大型诗歌总集，共305篇。秦始皇焚书坑儒时，毛遂后人毛亨、毛苌叔侄二人冒着生命危险把《诗经》藏在毛官营村自家的假墓里，才使《诗经》得以留存，并暗中注解和编撰《诗经》。毛亨著有《毛诗诂训传》。毛苌著有《毛诗》等书。毛遂后裔中的毛释之、毛鹿、毛舜等都是封侯人物。后裔毛藻，其曾祖父毛买，曾任北齐仪同三司，常山太守；祖父毛宁，隋朝人，曾任太府寺主簿；父亲毛乡，隋朝人，曾任洛州宜阳县令。毛藻后裔毛文纲，元朝人，曾任平章政事；毛萼章曾任都督。\n2008年，经中国氏研究会考证，毛氏家族的祖地及迁徙地可以概括为，岐山（祖食邑地）——巨鹿（祖地采邑今河北鸡泽）——滕国（迁徙今山东省滕州市）——阳武（迁徙今河南原阳县）——浙江（迁徙地）——江西（迁徙地）——云南（迁徙地）——湖南（迁徙地）。从迁徙路线可以看出，毛遂、毛苌与湖南韶山毛氏一脉相承，鸡泽毛氏与韶山毛氏血脉相通。湖南韶山毛氏族谱《源流记》记载：“吾姓系出周姬文王子毛伯郑之后，世为作卿，因国为氏。自毛亨、毛苌注经训诂，西河遗派，固深且远矣。汉晋唐宋迄明，莫不代有伟人，光炳青史。考其源根，历历可根。承其年代，派衍如珠之串，如蝉之联，不惟赫耀千古矣。”从湖南韶山二修族谱也可以得出佐证。凭着翔实的资料和考证，2008年11月，中国毛氏研究会最终认定：鸡泽县是毛遂、毛苌故里，祖籍地和出生成长地，韶山毛氏是鸡泽毛遂直系后裔。中国毛氏研究会会长毛炳汉先生诗曰：“鸡泽毛遂一荐名，毛亨毛苌传诗经；后人数迁到韶山，孕育伟人毛泽东”。\n鸡泽毛官营村是“毛遂自荐”中毛遂的故乡，毛遂部分后人迁徙至河南、浙江、江西、云南等地，后辗转至韶山——诞生了一代伟人毛泽东，也就是说一代伟人毛泽东祖籍地是鸡泽，毛遂是毛泽东的第22世祖，因此鸡泽韶山缔结友好城市“名士毛遂故里毛泽东祖籍地以及中国辣椒之乡”2009河北·鸡泽文化省会行在石家庄举行。同时，《毛遂自荐》纪念邮票也于当日正式发行。2011年11月26日，鸡泽又把一年一度的辣椒节搬到了湖南韶山举办。2011年12月2日，作为“中国辣椒之乡”、毛遂故里的河北鸡泽县，与湖南韶山有着血脉宗亲渊源关系。“韶山市鸡泽辣椒种植示范基地”在湖南省韶山市毛泽东故居斜对面揭碑成立。\n\n## 风景名胜\n\n毛遂公园\n毛遂公园位于县城东部新区，富园大街以东、人民路南侧，融入“椒乡”特色和鸡泽县的历史文化元素，成为鸡泽县标志性休闲健身场所；公园包括湖面8公顷，山体6公顷，绿化、造景、文化设施19公顷。在结构上，分为一湖、一山、三岛、八景、九区的凤山龙岛景观，并融入了该县晋侯盟台、凤山晓月、古城幻影、石佛神池等八个历史文化特色景观。\n毛遂墓\n毛遂墓《鸡泽文史资料》指出在“郡城西南”。也就是永年县。《永年县志》中记载：“在城西南五里的大堤内有毛遂墓”。相传，当年毛遂墓墓冢高大，被永年列为“平干八景”之一，称之为“毛遂高峰”。明代永年籍的太仆丞申佳允曾写过一首谒毛遂墓的诗：“一剑横阶气若何，平原轻侠尽消磨，铜盘热血惊蛮楚，锥颖英魂壮滏河。碑自苍苍看独峙，世多碌碌许谁过。几回凭吊郊南墓，野树虹光满碧萝。”毛遂墓前曾有墓志，在清末战乱年代被驻守永年城内的盐警盗去，下落不明。\n\n##

历史文化\n\n### 综述\n\n早在8000年前新石器时期就有先民在这里繁衍生息，磁县是赵都、殷都、邺都“三都”文化交汇地，磁州窑文化、仰韶文化、殷商文化、赵文化、曹魏建安文化、北朝文化都留有丰厚遗存，有国家、省、市级文物保护单位145处，是河北省第二文物大县。磁县民间艺术源远流长，主要有民间花会和民间工艺两大类，民间花会有抬阁、背阁、彩帷、高低跷、讶鼓、旱船、竹马等40余种，民间工艺有剪纸、盆景、刺绣、面塑、印花布、绒画等20余种。磁县自古仁人志士辈出，涌现出了战国名相蔺相如、金朝文学家赵秉义、北齐名将高肃、明代兵部尚书张镜心、被陈赓将军誉为“越狱大王”的忠诚共产主义战士王维刚等众多历史名人。磁县还是革命老区，在邯郸党建史上有“九个第一”(第一个中国共产党党员、第一个共产党小组、第一个中共支部、第一个县委、第一个中共中心县委、第一个特委、第一次党的会议、第一个参加中共全国代表大会的代表、第一个抗日民主政府)。建国后，毛泽东、周恩来、胡锦涛等党和国家领导人曾亲临磁县视察工作。\n\n### 文化遗产\n\n剪纸\n磁县剪纸，又称窗花、剪花、剪彩，是民间流行的一种传统装饰艺术。磁县剪纸以剪刀和刻刀为工具，把纸剪出各种形状，采用阴阳、虚实相间的手法，刻画内部线条和花纹，通过虚与实、阴与阳的对比体现图案，这些图案为各种花鸟、动物、人物以及吉祥图案，在民间节气、风俗活动中作为一种装饰营造各种环境气氛。磁县剪纸是民俗文化的产物，其表现形式、主题内涵、艺术风格都蕴含着伦理道德和审美情趣，因其简洁灵活的表现手法和重于表意的造型规律，成为民间艺术中的奇葩，被人们誉为“活化石”。\n扎纸技艺\n磁县扎纸技艺，是邯郸市磁县的传统手工技艺类非物质文化遗产项目。磁县扎纸造型奇特，色彩鲜艳，形神兼备，栩栩如生，具有强烈的民间艺术特色。作品取材于历史史实和民间生活。扎纸艺术就近取材，用当地产的芦苇来扎制成人物的骨架和器物的框架，再用浆糊贴上纸后用颜料彩绘，最后用彩色剪纸来装饰。\n平调落子\n平调落子剧种也称武安平调落子，是流行于邯郸地域的独有剧种，它也是磁县的家乡戏。平调落子是武安平调和武安落子的合称，武安平调可能发源于磁县、武安市、峰峰矿区、涉县的边界地带，具体发源于哪还不详，武安落子发源于武安市。清末民初两个剧种合班演出，由史以来磁县的西部地区，一些村里都曾成立过平调落子剧团，历史上也出过很多著名演员。现今如磁县的陶泉乡、都党乡、北贾壁乡、白土镇、黄沙镇等乡镇还流传着一些平调落子剧团。2006年5月20日，平调落子经国务院批准列入第一批国家级非物质文化遗产名录。\n怀调\n怀调，当地人称红黑脸戏，是发源于豫北安阳的传统戏曲剧种，形成于明万历年间至清初。作为一种传统民间戏曲，怀调剧目以古装戏为主，剧目上多反映忠奸斗争，将帅保边，政治色彩很浓。怀调生、旦、净、末、丑行当齐全，人物刻画细致，每个行当又有具体分工，如净又分为红脸、大红脸、二红脸；黑脸分大黑脸、二黑脸；花脸则分为大花脸、二花脸、三花脸。怀调戏剧表演丰韵生动，造型古朴，线条流畅，色彩鲜明，具有强烈的民间艺术乡土魅力。\n\n##

历史沿革\n\n古交境域春秋属晋。\n\n战国属赵，汉、魏、晋及北朝均为晋阳西陲。\n\n隋开皇十六年（596），析晋阳西境置交城县，县治在古交镇。\n\n唐天授二年（691），交城县治徙大陵庄（今交城县城），以就驿道。先天二年（713），析交城县北境于今古交境域置卢川县，县治在今炉峪口。开元二年（714），撤卢川县复并入交城县。此后直到民国初年的1200多年中，古交境内无县级建置。\n民国26年（1937）11月，日军先后侵占了太原和交城县城。随着抗日战争形势的发展和中国共产党领导的晋绥边区（晋绥革命根据地）的开创，古交境内的建置发生了重大的变化。\n民国26年（1937）11月至翌年3月八路军一二零师三五八旅挺进古交，发动群众组建了半政权性质的阳（曲）交（城）边区民族革命战争战地总动员委员会，初创了革命根据地。\n民国27年（1938）3月至翌年，山西省第八行政督察员公署在河口镇成立，后移驻狮子河一带，同时，山西省阳曲县政府驻河口一带，交城县政府驻屯兰川一带。\n从民国29至34年（1940-1945）8月抗日战争胜利，晋绥边区第八分区专员公署（原山西省第二游击区第八分区专员公署，1941年8月改称为晋西北第八分区专员公署，1943年11月该称上名）先是游动，后长驻在屯兰川关头村一带。交城县抗日民主政府驻屯兰川、原平川一带，阳曲县抗日民主政府驻狮子河一带。\n民国35年（1946）冬，阎军进占古交镇、河口等地，并主建了古交行政管理区（县级），旋即被根据地军民摧垮。\n\n民国35年至37年（1946-1948）7月，阳曲县政府驻河口、曹坪、大南坪一带。\n新中国成立后，1958年8月划阳曲县的嘉乐泉、阁上、梭峪、曹坪、杏林坪、大南坪、河口与交城县的河南、古交9个乡，初置太原市河口工矿区、区领导机关驻河口镇。同年11月上旬，又划交城县的岔口、营立、姬家庄、镇城底、原相、南头、草庄头、邢家社乡\n8个乡，连前共17个乡，改制太原市古交工矿区。\n1971年8月，娄烦县的长足上大队和雁门大队划归本区。\n1988年，经国务院批准，古交撤区建市。\n\n## 行政区划\n\n2021年3月，阁上乡整建制并入嘉乐泉乡。\n\n截止至2022年7月，古交市辖3镇6乡4个街道，分别是河口镇、镇城底镇、嘉乐泉乡、马兰镇、梭峪乡、邢家社乡、岔口乡、原相乡、常安乡、屯兰街道、东曲街道、西曲街道和桃园街道。\n\n## 地理环境\n\n###

历史沿革\n\n### 地名由来\n\n曲麻莱，以县境内曲麻河（楚玛尔河）与莱阳大难而得名，意为“红色的河，宽阔的滩”。\n\n### 建置沿革\n\n早在2万年前，曲麻莱地区即有人类居住。\n全新世（距今约1万年）以来高原气候急剧寒冷化，自然条件日益严酷，曲麻莱地区逐渐沦为无人区。\n4000年前，曲麻莱境内又开始出现人类活动。\n战国到秦汉，昆仑山以南的地区属西羌故地。\n魏晋南北朝至隋，曲麻莱地区仍属西羌故地，为苏毗国领地之部分，为白兰羌活动地区。\n隋、唐，称之为“女国”“东女国”。\n唐，属吐蕃领地。唐初吐蕃赞普松赞干布率军先后灭党项、白兰、吐谷浑，曲麻莱地区始成吐蕃领地。\n南宋，属囊谦部落王族直接管辖，为囊谦部落辖地。同期，年措部落在曲麻莱南部出现，曲麻莱南部为年措部落辖地。\n元，属吐蕃地，受路宣慰使司辖。\n明，属朵甘思宣慰司地。\n清崇德元年（1636年），属和硕特蒙古政权辖，曲麻莱地区成为和硕特蒙古势力范围。雍正二年（1724年），以囊谦千户为首的玉树25族得到清朝政府封号，其中上年措部落分布在通天河北岸今曲麻莱东南部地区。雍正三年（1725年），在西宁设立总理青海蒙古番子事务大臣（西宁办事大臣）衙门，曲麻莱地区归西宁办事大臣统辖。\n民国元年（1912年），曲麻莱地区归西宁办事长官管辖，旋改隶番宣慰使和甘边宁海镇守使辖，民国六年（1917年），属玉树理事辖。民国十年（1921），以布久昂周（亦称红柯）为首的7户藏族牧民从果洛地区的阿江部落迁移至安塔秀沟，后逐渐东移到扎陵湖畔的措哇尕泽一带游牧，为布久红阿部落。1935年，又陆续从青海果洛，四川日孜等地迁来多仓、俄仓、然仓、哈秀、贝沙、干巴、尕托、河喇嘛8个部落，形成9个部落，又称“上果洛”。\n民国二十九年（1940），青海省国民政府在韩有禄团部的哈姜地区、下果洛达的海、鄂陵湖东及野马滩、长石头一带建立星川设治局（为星宿海和洪水川之缩称），辖境相当于今曲麻莱县全境及玛多县西部地区。1947年，马步芳在曲麻莱地区建立“布久宗”（宗，为藏语“县”的音译，仅为建制形式），委任米福堂为“布久千户”，星川设治局并未撤销。之后，分布于今曲麻河乡及以西可可西里等地的然仓部落首领称“然仓千户”。\n1949年11月，星川设治局（上果洛）随玉树地区和平解放。\n1950年6月，改“星川设治局”为“曲麻莱设治局”，由省直辖。\n1952年11月，改曲麻莱没治局为曲麻莱区，青海省直辖。\n1953年10月，改曲麻莱区为曲麻莱县。\n1953年12月，曲麻莱县由原青海省直管，划隶玉树藏族自治州辖。\n\n## 行政区划\n\n### 区划沿革\n\n1956年，析曲麻莱县东部区域、果洛州甘德县、达日县之部分，置玛多县。\n1956年12月，布久、多仓、俄仓、贝沙、哈秀、然仓、干巴、河喇嘛、尕托9个部落，组建为3个肖格（乡）。哈秀、贝沙、干巴、河喇嘛4个部落组建成立秋智肖格；多仓，俄仓，尕托，布久4个部落组建成立麻多肖格；然仓部落组建成立然仓肖格；\n1958年10月，实行县社合一公社化体制，撤销3个肖格，分别组建成立曲麻河、巴颜、雅拉达泽3个大队。同月，治多县上年措肖格划归曲麻莱县管辖，改建为叶格大队（乡级政权）。\n1959年1月，成立天河县，叶格大队划归天河县辖，分设为东风、巴干2个人民公社。3月，曲麻河大队改名为先锋人民公社，巴颜大队改名为巴颜人民公社；撤销雅拉达泽大队，成立农业大队。\n1961年10月，撤销农业大队。\n1962年7月，先锋人民公社更名为曲麻河乡，析其部分置叶格乡；巴颜人民公社更名为麻多乡，析其部分置秋智乡。11月，撤销天河县，东风、巴干2个人民公社又划归曲麻莱县辖。\n1969年11月，乡改称人民公社，巴干乡改名为八一人民公社、麻多乡改名为四一人民公社、叶格乡改名为永红人民公社、曲麻河乡改名为卫东人民公社。\n1971年3月，恢复人民公社名称。八一人民公社恢复为巴干人民公社、四一人民公社恢复为麻多人民公社、永红人民公社恢复为叶格人民公社、卫东人民公社恢复为曲麻河人民公社。\n1974年，西藏安多县发生特大雪灾后，借用曲麻河公社唐古拉山（可可西里）地区4.5万平方千米草场救灾，自此，唐古拉山（可可西里）地区草场便再未回到曲麻莱县曲麻河人民公社。后来西藏自治区把唐古拉山地区草场归还青海省，青海省政府则把唐古拉山地区草场交给格尔木市暂时代管。\n1984年5月，撤销人民公社建制，恢复为乡。\n\n### 区划详情\n\n截至2022年10月，曲麻莱县下辖1个镇、5个乡：约改镇、巴干乡、秋智乡、叶格乡、麻多乡、曲麻河乡。\n19个村委会、65个牧民小组。另有长江、黄河、扎西、德勒以及格尔木生态移民社区。\n县人民政府驻约改镇黄河路50号。\n\n## 地理环境\n\n### 位置境域\n\n曲麻莱县，位于青海省西南部，玉树藏族自治州北部，昆仑山南麓，通天河北岸，地处东经9256'一97°35′，北纬33°36'一35°40'之间。北部西段为终年积雪的昆仑山主脉，东段以阿拉克湖、洪水川与海西蒙古族藏族自治州格尔木市、都兰县分界；东北部邻扎陵湖与果洛藏族自治州玛多县相连，西与可可西里接壤；东南与玉树州称多县为邻；南与玉树州玉树市、治多县隔通天河相望；西以青藏公路（109国道）和青藏铁路与可可西里国家级自然保护区相接。东西长405千米，南北宽237千米。总面积52446平方千米（含可可西里部分地区）。\n\n### 地形\n\n曲麻莱县，境内横跨通天河（长江）、黄河两大水系，县境西北部为宽谷大滩，地域辽阔，东南重山叠岭，县域内平均海拔4500米以上，其中县城海拔4226米。境内高山、盆地、滩地相间，主要山脉有昆仑山、巴颜喀拉山、可可西里、冬乌拉山。\n\n###

服饰\n\n藏族传统服饰中，较多地应用了水纹、云纹、龙纹、孔雀羽纹和花草纹样，还有日、月、星辰、山的变形图案，简练生动，绘形绘色。这种艺术风格，主要源自藏民族早期的原始自然崇拜观念和信仰。还有动物图腾，如马、牛、羊、龙、孔雀、猕猴等（体现在藏袍和帽子上的各种皮毛装饰上）。早期的本教，也主要是以崇拜天、地、水、火等自然物为特征的。玉树藏袍边饰中的“雍仲”符号，也是太阳和火的象征，仍在藏区流行的煨桑、跳神、禳解、祭神以及婚丧礼仪中的一些习俗一样，成为根深蒂固存在的古老自然崇拜的遗留文化符号。\n服饰中的自然崇拜，还体现在宝石饰物上。和崇拜山一样，玉树藏人也崇拜石。他们认为石头是山的组成部分，也是大自然的灵物，是神的杰作。尤其是珍贵的各种宝石，如红珊瑚、绿松石、玛瑙、天珠、琥珀等是天神赐给人类的吉祥物，能趋灾避邪，吸收天地灵气，圣瑞之极。\n玉树曲麻莱县藏区的传统服饰吸收了唐卡、堆绣和壁画这些藏传佛教艺术中的图案（如莲花、宝瓶、双鱼、寿字等佛家“八宝”瑞物）、色彩（浓重的红、黄、蓝、白、紫等）和内容，并喜欢使用抽象化、变形、夸张的艺术手法，增加了服饰的装饰美感。正是本民族艺术与佛教艺术的长期互补融合，使玉树传统服饰形成了自己鲜明的特色。\n\n### 项饰\n\n藏族的项饰以天珠（藏语叫“斯”，其中以九眼石最为神奇）和珊瑚（藏语叫“曲茹”）为主，再配以绿松石、珍珠、玛瑙、玉石等，论串儿戴。男子一般戴两颗珊瑚珠夹一个天珠的项链。女子的项链，平时只戴一串，每串约有30颗珠宝，节日盛装时戴2至8串。胸前还有一种与宗教明显有关的金银制的护身佛龛，叫“嘎乌”，内装佛像、佛咒等加持圣物，不仅华丽精致，还可通过它来传达对佛的虔诚，被视为护身物。\n女装一定要饰以华贵的腰带，这种腰带，是由镂花鎏金的白银板或白铜板连缀而成的，每条都嵌有二三十颗珠宝，精雕细镂，图案精美，华贵漂亮，十分考究，一般戴二至三条。腰带，有大带和小带两种，大带系腰，小带围臀，勾画出女性的曲线美，据说这是玉树藏族服饰的一个独创。腰带上还要配挂上金银雕镂镶着珠宝的小佩刀、针匣、奶桶钩、银链、响铃串等，更显得珠光宝气，琳琅满目。但平时，女子的腰带却较为简单，一般戴革质的，上有镂空的花纹图案，素朴大方。男子身上一般佩腰刀、弹带、火镰以至叉子枪等，以显武勇和阳刚。\n玉树曲麻莱县藏族男女喜欢戴象骨、金银和玉制的手镯，还有天珠、珊瑚、绿松石、象骨珠串成的腕饰。戒指多为金银铜制的鞍形藏式戒指，嵌有红珊瑚、玛瑙、天珠、绿松石等各类珠宝。耳环，男女都戴，男戴左不戴右，女子戴双耳环，有金银铜制多种，多镶嵌有玛瑙、珊瑚、绿松石等各类珠宝。女子的耳环，下端还垂吊一颗珊瑚珠和金丝银链串成的花坠儿。\n\n### 禁忌\n\n自然和动物禁忌\n禁止在神山和寺庙周围乱砍挖树木、花草、药材和捕杀动物；忌搅动泉眼或在泉水中洗东西；禁忌捕杀鹰鹫；忌宰杀放生的牛羊和骑用的马匹。\n\n婚姻和日常生活禁忌\n禁忌孕妇到别人家串门或参加婚礼；禁忌吃兽类肉；禁忌父系血统和母系血统的人婚配；忌男女生肖相克；忌父与女、母与子、兄弟与姐妹等在场时谈婚论嫁与性有关的话题。\n\n丧葬和宗教禁忌\n家人或亲戚死后禁忌谈笑、歌舞；在服丧49天内禁家人洗头、沐浴、饮酒、盛装；平时忌提死者的名字；禁忌进人经堂不脱帽子、喧哗和乱敲钟鼓；禁忌跨过袈裟和经书、法器等；禁忌在寺庙里吸烟、饮酒、随地吐痰、随地大小便；忌逆时针反转寺庙、佛塔、圣山、玛尼石推和经轮等；忌在供品和酥油上吹气和打哈欠；忌用有文字的纸张特别是经文纸擦东西或当卫生纸；禁忌将佛像和经书放在床底下或践踏。\n\n## 风景名胜\n\n曲麻莱县，已查明旅游自然资源51处、人文景观6处、古文化遗址1处，州级文物保护单位1处。\n\n勒巴沟岩画\n勒巴沟沟口是历史文化古迹文成公主庙，刻有六字真经和其他经文的嘛尼石随处可见。有的昭示于天日之下，有的浸润在涓涓流水之中，有的掩映在绿草翠叶之间，构成了让人惊叹的巨石文化景观。岩画带有浓厚的唐代佛教造型艺术风格，从石刻岩画上体态丰满的唐代侍女和古藏文看，勒巴沟岩画的创造要追溯到1300年前。\n通天河晒经台\n通天河自西北向东南流淌在玉树草原上，横贯近千公里，哺育了玉树草原的万物，位于通天河大桥南岸，有一块巨大的岩石，旁边有几颗古柏，树上挂满经布。因传说唐僧当年在此晒经而得名。\n黄河的发源地\n曲麻莱县是黄河的发源地，黄河在青海境内藏语称“玛曲”意为孔雀河，其正源发源于麻多乡西南巴颜喀拉山脉的卡日曲北麓约古宗列盆地西南隅。东经92°56'北纬35°40'，约古宗列曲发源于约古宗列山北麓的一股山泉，向东南流经星宿海后称为玛曲，境内流域面积3194平方公里，总长112.7公里。黄河源头群山耸立，草原广袤，是三江源主要的水源涵养之一，在中国乃至世界生态地位举足轻重。\n\n##

历史沿革\n\n五原这个古地名源于夏朝。相传四千多年前，天下洪水泛滥，大禹采取疏导之法，根治洪水，待水势减退后，在高埠处首先出现了若干个丘状原所，其中有五个较大的原所，人们在原所之上辟田、造屋、繁衍、生息、耕作。五原称谓始而至此。\n商朝时期河套地区为鬼方辖域。西周属昆夷、熏粥、猃狁诸民族牧区。周赧王16年（前301年）赵武灵王置云中郡。九原是云中郡的一个属县，五原为九原的西部地区，自此，五原地域始有隶属。为了巩固新开拓的疆宇，公元前298年“赵武灵王命吏大夫奴迁于九原”并实行移民屯垦。\n战国末年，当中原诸侯国互争雄长，激烈交战，无暇顾及北方地区之际，占据阴山南北一带的匈奴族乘机南下，占领了河南地（“河”指黄河，当时在阴山下，河套平原的北端。逐渐移至当前位置）。\n秦统一六国后，为了解除匈奴对秦王朝的威胁，秦始皇33年（前214年）派蒙恬将兵三十万北击匈奴，经过两年的争战，收复了“河南地”，迫使匈奴向北退却七百余里。从此“胡人不敢南下牧马，士人不敢弯弓而报怨”。为了加强边境防御，秦“因河为塞，筑三十四县城。”（又一说为四十四座县城）。分天下为三十六郡，将九原升为九原郡，郡址设在五原。五原为九原郡之西部地。秦王朝还采取了修直道、筑长城、垦北假等相应措施来巩固北疆。公元前210年，始皇驾崩，赵高杀蒙恬，中原大乱，匈奴乘机复越长城，渡河南下，占据河套地区和阴山一带，在冒顿单于的统驭下，匈奴的部落联盟更加强大，它东灭东胡，南并楼烦、白羊、燕代，北并丁零、坚昆，往西击走月氏，征服塔里木盆地西域诸国，控制了整个蒙古草原。此时，河套是匈奴的主要活动地区。\n汉武帝时，为了彻底解除匈奴的威胁，派卫青反击匈奴，元朔二年（前127）收复了河南地。为了加强防御，将九原郡一分为二，东部地区改名五原郡，西部地区改称朔方郡。五原郡治九原县，领县十六，即：九原、固陵、五原（此五原并非今五原，当在包头孟家梁故城西，《水经注》载“九原县西北接对一城，盖五原县之故城也”即今包头孟家梁故城西郊哈德门故城）临沃、文国、河阴、浦泽、南兴、武都、宜梁、曼

宜、禾固阳、莫黑旦、西安阳、河目。这些县大部分设置在黄河河套东部两岸的台地上。朔方郡治朔方县（在今西山咀黄河南岸伊盟杭锦旗北独贵乌拉乡境）领县十，即朔方、修都、临河、呼遒、渠搜、沃野、广牧、临戎、三封、窳浑。这些县除三封、临戎、窳浑在西套外，大都设置在鄂尔多斯北境的黄河两岸，五原郡隶属于朔方刺史部。成帝元延、绥和之际（约前8年），五原郡领十六县。平帝元始二年（2年），有39322户，231328人，绝大部分居民为汉人。\n西汉末年，王莽覆灭后，匈奴支持卢芳称帝，占据了五原、朔方、云中、定襄、雁门五郡，建都于九原。由于长期争战，使北方“边陲萧条，靡有孑遗，障塞破坏，亭坠绝灭。”\n东汉光武帝建武十六年（公元41）收复五原、朔方诸郡复置郡州。建武二十五年（公元49）匈奴内争，分为南北两部，南单于附汉仍入居塞内，活动于阴山南麓河套一带，并于鄂尔多斯之美稷建南单于庭，命左贤王屯朔方。\n魏、晋、南北朝时期，其地为鲜卑、羌胡所据。活动在蒙古大草原整个北方民族，有匈奴、鲜卑、羯、氐、羌，名称五胡，大多进入长城，移居黄河流域，他们彼此互相争伐，河套地区先为前赵匈奴遗族刘虎、刘卫辰所据。继而由鲜卑族拓跋氏所占领，后赵又为羯族石虎所攻占，前秦氐族符坚得其地，后秦为羌族姚兴部所辖领。东晋安帝义熙二年（407）匈奴族铁弗刘武复进入河套、陕西一带，建立夏国，后由赫连勃勃统领，建都统万城（今伊克昭盟乌审旗南）。此后，鲜卑族拓跋部势力日渐强大，从东北大兴安岭南迁大泽，向西进入河套地区，最后统一了北方各部落。天兴元年（398）建立北魏王朝，北魏为了防御柔然民族的侵袭在塞北一带建立七个军事重镇。河套地区为沃野镇之辖境。北魏时，黄河南迁，故道改称乌加河，至此，始有黄河后套之说。孝武帝永熙三年（534），北魏王朝复分为东魏、西魏，五原属西魏辖境。他们统治的时间很短，很快就被北齐、北周所取代。北周宇文氏置银、夏两州，分领今河套鄂尔多斯全境，并于今巴盟河套地区置永丰镇（今临河县境内）。\n公元581年，隋文帝纂周灭陈，统一宇内，建立隋王朝，开皇三年，废郡置州，五原属丰州。州初不领县，仍称永丰镇，至五年始废镇置永丰县。六年又于州东南四十里置丰安镇，五原隶属之。隋炀帝大业三年（607）又改州为郡，五原属五原郡（郡址在城南西土城故城），后因战乱，近边难守，未久即废。\n唐朝初年，突厥又复强盛，“控弦百万”，五原为突厥所踞。唐贞观四年（630）命将李靖、徐  分道北伐，逐突厥于潮海之北，唐王朝将全国分为十道，二百九十三府州，五原属关内道丰州所辖。唐中叶沿边增设六都护府以治理边疆各少数民族。贞观二十一年（647），在今内蒙古西部一带改设燕然都护府，辖狼山羁糜府州二十七处，河套地区属丰州都督府。高宗永徽年间（650），在河套地区置永丰、九原两县，后又增置丰安县。武则天时期，突厥默啜可汗连年犯边，景龙二年（708），张仁愿任朔方大总管，当默啜可汗出兵新疆之机，乘虚夺取河南地，在黄河北岸修筑屯兵城堡，即东、中、西三受降城，以绝突厥南进之路。迨至唐中叶以后，五原为西受降城（今乌拉特中旗乌加河镇北圐圙补隆古城）辖境。后改为定军制，府州悉由节度兼领，五原隶属于天德军使节度兼安北都护府统领。唐末，党项族拓跋部（羌族的一支），趁宋辽连年交战之机，不断扩张势力，据有银、夏、绥、宥、静五州之地（今陕西西北部、宁夏东部及内蒙古河套、伊克昭盟、阿拉善盟境域），成为五代时期西北一大强国。公元1038年，元昊称帝，建立大夏（又称西夏），定都兴庆府（今宁夏银川市）共传十世，历时194年。五代及宋、辽、金、夏时期，五原皆为西夏属地。\n自12世纪始，游牧在北方草原的蒙古族部落日趋强盛，铁木真（成吉思汗）经过十年征战，于公元1227年灭夏，1260年成吉思汗的孙子忽必烈继汗位，公元1271年正式定国号为元，定都燕京（今北京）。元代施行行省制，省下设路，路下设州，五原属中书省大同路云内州西部地。\n明代270多年间，北方蒙古草原，兵连祸结，蒙古各封建领主之间，互争雄长。明初，套内则为元将扩廓铁木儿（小字王保保）占领。洪武中期，王保保被逐，收其地。洪武末，置卫所，巴盟西部河套属宁夏辖境隶陕西统领。明中叶以后，河套全境为元裔达延汗之子孙辖领。天顺、弘治时为蒙古族阿罗出、毛里孩、满都护等相互攻占之地。成化四年（1468），阿罗出为其党 加思兰所杀，并其众属，与满都护结合居套内。未几，火筛部复入套地，号称鄂尔多斯，服属于察哈尔部，有子九人，分牧而居。河套东部则为俺答（阿拉坦汗）之部，名叫土默特。隆庆五年（1571），俺答议和，明朝封为顺义王，万历中始改其所居库库忽洞为归化城（即呼和浩特市旧城）。明末河套内外悉为蒙古之游牧驻地。\n公元1644年，满族入关，推翻明朝统治，建立清王朝。太宗于天聪六年（1632）征服土默特部，历崇德、顺治至康熙三年（1664），清政府以戈壁为界，将塞北蒙疆先后划定内外蒙古牧地，内蒙古设置二十五个部、六个盟、五十个旗，五原属鄂尔多斯部伊克昭盟左翼后旗（亦称达拉旗）、右翼后旗（亦称杭锦旗）地各一部。雍正、乾隆间，置道设厅。雍正六年（1728）设归绥道。乾隆六年（1714）设萨拉齐协理通判。乾隆二十五年（1760），因塞外人口增多，垦荒日繁，随于口外设七厅（后增为十二厅），改萨拉齐为理事通判厅，五原属萨拉齐厅西部地。从此，实行旗不管汉，厅不管蒙，蒙汉分治，旗县并存的两种特殊建制。同治四年，改设同知，光绪十年又改抚民同知厅。光绪二十九年（1903）析萨拉齐厅西部地区（达拉特、杭锦、乌拉特旗地区）设五原厅，治大佘太，后移治于隆兴长（今五原县城所在地）。\n民国元年（1912），改五原厅为五原县，三年建县城于白（北）圪梁（旧城），统领后套全境。中国的大上海市区，街、路的规划名称均按全国较有名声的市、县和地区方位选定，因五原是塞外河套地区著名的粮仓，故在上海市区的西北角设有五原路。民国八年，析乌拉特前旗地一部别隶固阳。民国14年，又划出五原东西各一部，设安北、临河两县。\n民国31年（1942），绥西实行新县制，将五、临、安三县划为六县，析五原县西部地增设晏江县（1954年改称达拉特后旗）。\n1958年7月，撤销达拉特后旗建制，辖区复并入五原县辖领。至今，五原县之建置再未改变。\n\n## 行政区划\n\n五原县辖8个镇、1个乡、1个农场：隆兴昌镇、塔尔湖镇、巴音套海镇、新公中镇、天吉太镇、胜丰镇、银定图镇、复兴镇，和胜乡，巴彦淖尔市建丰农场。\n县政府驻隆兴昌镇。\n\n## 地理环境\n\n### 位置境域\n\n五原地处内蒙古河套平原腹地，县域南临黄河（属黄河最北端），北有阴山横亘，东临鹿城包头市，西与临河市接壤，是一颗有着两千多年文明历史的塞上明珠。地理坐标为东经107°35′70″－108°37′50″，北纬40°46\" 30′－41°16″45′。县境东西最长82公里，均长62.3公里，南北最宽55.5公里，均宽40公里。总面积2544平方公里\n。占河套灌区总面积的1/4。\n\n### 地质地貌\n\n该县在大地构造单元上，属阴山天山纬向构造带，并受新华夏系构造的影响，形成内陆断陷盆地，整个辖区属河套平原，为第四纪松散的地层所覆盖，沉积了较厚的湖相地层。上部是冲积、风积层，主要岩性为细砂、粉砂和砂粘土互层。砂层层理清晰，厚度10－70米。中部为河湖交替层，主要岩性为淤泥质、粉砂与粘土互层。下部为巨厚的新老第四纪湖相沉积层，主要岩性为淤泥质砂粘土。土质膏腴肥美，适于农作物及各种植被的生长。虽然有的土地呈盐碱化，但并不影响耐碱作物，如葵花、枸杞等作物的生长。黄河由五、临交界处老楞河头入境，为东经107°37′，至五原前旗交界处的四科河头出境，为东经108°11′。此段河道是黄河干流在地球表面纬度最高的河段。五原境内的黄河流经天吉泰镇、套海镇。其北与之并行的是总干渠（二黄河），它由磴口、临河向东进入五原，又进入前旗而汇入三湖河，在五原境内长43.5公里。县内各干渠均由此渠引水灌溉。与黄河有关的是乌加河（旧时亦称五角河、五加河），它原是黄河的主流，是北河。 1840年黄河改道后主流成为南河，在改道的过程中使整个河套平原成为土质肥沃的冲积平原。乌加河是黄河的支流，由临河市的份子地进入五原，由建丰农场出界，泄入乌拉特前旗的三湖河，在五原地段为 46公里长。新中国成立后，经多次修浚成为灌区的总排水干沟。\n\n### 气候\n\n气候属于中温带大陆性气候，具有光能丰富、日照充足、干燥多风、降雨量少的特点。太阳年平均辐射总量153.44卡/平方厘米，仅次于西藏、青海；2012年日照时数3263小时，平均气温6.1℃，积温3362.5℃；无霜期117～136天，相对较短，可避免农作物贪青恋长、推迟成熟而减产的弊端，可使农作物长势集中，丰产丰收。年均降雨量170毫米，大多集中在夏秋两季，雨热同季，对农作物生长十分有利。\n\n### 水文\n\n五原境内因黄河冲积层在长期风蚀作用下形成许多风蚀洼地和黄河改道时冲刷的天然壕沟。这些洼地与壕沟长年积水，形成大小不同的海子（湖泊，俗称泊尔洞）。全县有面积三亩以上的海子 171个，总面积 5.45万亩；其中千亩以上的海子 5个，总面积 1.06万亩；百亩以上的海子 37个，总面积 1.33万亩。海子水深大于 1.5米的 116个，面积 2.71万亩。 1986年已被利用的水面 3.8万亩，占 70%。这些海子大多分布在县境西部的塔尔湖镇、银定图乡、海子堰乡、什巴乡，以及县境南部的套海镇、东部的胜丰镇。城南、美林、隆镇也有零星分布。\n\n##

历史文化\n\n名称来历\n雅江，藏语名为“亚曲喀”，即“河口”之意。因系雅砻江重要渡口之一，建制县时也曾以河口命名，后更名雅江，是因其县治所处位置在雅砻江边而得名。\n\n雅江是藏族聚居区，具有丰厚的文化底蕴，锅庄、弦子、山歌、酒歌、箍箍卦等藏区流行的五大歌舞形式在雅江的村寨、牧场广为流传。境内的“跺踢卓”是独具特色的“鸳鸯舞”，舞者男女默契、若即若离。\n雅江的宗教文化，具有很强的包容性，黄教、白教、红教、黑教、花教五大流派境内都齐全。\n木雅文化\n木雅文化，分布在藏文典籍所记载的木雅热岗，即今康定县折多山以西、道孚以南、雅江以东、九龙以北地区。居住在这一区域内的藏族，被称为“木雅娃”。\n木雅人的先民，是古代的党项羌，原分布在今四川、甘肃、青海三省交壤的地区，吐蕃王朝将其征服后，称之为“弭药”。\n木雅人有自己的语言，其语言结构与西夏语十分接近，词汇中的西夏语和羌语支语言同源词较多。木雅语分为东部方言和西部方言，九龙县的湾坝、洪坝一带，属东部方言区，操这种方言的木雅藏族，自称“木勒”；九龙县汤古乡，康定县的沙德乡、六巴乡、普沙绒乡、朋布西乡和雅江县的祝桑乡，属西部方言区，操这种方言的木雅藏族，自称“木雅”。东部方言受汉语影响较多，西部方言则深受藏语的影响。\n\n## 地方特产\n\n松 茸\n松茸学名松口蘑，别名松蕈，是世界上珍稀名贵的天然药用菌，松茸含有18种氨基酸，14种人体必需微量元素，松茸营养均衡有提高免疫力，抗癌抗肿瘤，治疗糖尿病及心血管疾病等多种功效。\n高原人参\n产于高原的人参，功效与主治：性寒、润肺散热、平息气喘。适用于肺炎、支气管炎、心脏病、高山不适，滋补养身、除口腔炎症。\n雅鱼\n雅鱼是高山雪水细鳞鱼，并非雅安那雅鱼，鱼形似鲤而鳞细如鳟，体形肥大，肉质细嫩，沙锅雅鱼为当地名菜。相传，清代上贡慈禧，太后赞美为“龙凤之肉”。\n\n鹿茸\n鹿茸为常用中药材，梅花鹿或马鹿的雄鹿未角化密性茸毛的幼角。鹿茸味甘，具有生精补髓、益肾助阳、强筋健骨等功效。四川主产马鹿茸。有人工饲养。主要药用成分为脑素、雌酮等。\n虫草\n又名冬虫夏草，人参、鹿茸并列为三大补品。冬虫夏草形态特征奇特，是菌与虫的复合体，虫草性甘味温，强壮滋补；治肺结核，滋肺补肾。\n\n## 风景名胜\n\n雅江县地处青藏高原东缘的高山峡谷与草原的过渡带，受其复杂地形的影响，形成了独特而神奇的自然景观；又因雅江县位于康巴地区腹地，立于茶马古道上，有丰富的康巴人文景观。\n\n吉仁湖\n吉仁湖是108个湖中，湖面最大，赋有神话般色彩的一个，海拔4100米。108个湖星罗棋布在四周，乌瞰吉仁湖，四个湖依次大小、色彩各异。\n古雅圣山\n古雅圣山全名叫“穷甲古雅圣山”，意为形如大鹏一样的圣山。古雅圣山是藏区26大圣山之一。您看，它披满褐色的怪石，构成层层叠叠的石阶，扶摇而升，多像一座天然而成的金字塔。\n帕母岭\n帕母岭风景区，站在海拔3988米的草坪中间，举目四望，我们可以发现帕母岭的四周都是峡谷，对面都是群山，所有的山岭都向着帕母岭。向东望，高尔寺山脉向南北伸展；往西看，剪子湾山脉向南蜿蜒。\n郭萨寺\n郭萨寺是康南第一古寺，一般的寺庙大都是靠山面水而建，郭萨寺却是靠水面山而建。这是郭萨寺奇特之一。\n郭萨寺，是西藏萨迦寺指派仲嘎吉村喇嘛赴京朝见皇帝归来，于元至正18年。1982年该寺作为我县第一批古寺由政府拨款修缮后对外开放，是州级重点文物保护单位。\n索洛寺\n索洛寺是藏语，意为“蒙古人遗下的寺庙”。建庙已900多年之久。这里只供奉了一位护法神叫真玛真。该寺每年11月份都要举行一次诵经会。\n茶马古道\n延伸在群山中的大道，就是著名的茶马古道。茶马古道在雅江县境内达187千米，留下的驿站遗址有5处。“饥马恨草短，仆夫苦衣单；悲歌猛虎行，惆怅行路难。”这是清代诗人李苞对茶马古道苍凉的真实描述。那些用白色和黑色石块堆积的石堆，藏名叫“多纳拉村”，意为敬奉山神的黑色石堆。\n\n## 荣誉称号\n\n2013年8月，雅江县被中国食用菌协会授予“中国松茸之乡”之盛誉。\n\n2013年8月28日，中央电视台7套每日农经栏目对雅江松茸进行专题报道《有魅力的高原松茸》。\n\n2014年4月，“雅江松茸”获国家市场监督管理总局（原国家工商总局）核准注册的“地理标志商标”。\n\n2020年6月30日，雅江县入选“第二批革命文物保护利用片区分县名单”。\n\n2021年2月，雅江县被评为2020年度四川省农村改革工作先进县（市、区）。\n\n2021年8月，雅江县被确立为“四川省乡村振兴重点帮扶县”。",

{"name": "永新", "documents": ["同义词\n永新（江西省吉安市行政区划）一般指永新县\n\n永新县，隶属江西省吉安市，位于江西省的西部、罗霄山脉中部，毗邻湘东，南接井冈山市，西邻湖南省茶陵县，西北与萍乡市莲花县接壤，北毗安福县，东连吉安县，东南邻泰和县。全县面积2195平方千米，辖1个街道、10个镇、13个乡。\n2021年末，永新县户籍人口52.36万人。\n\n永新县古称楚尾吴头，东汉建安九年（204年）建县，县名来源于《大学·礼记》，寓意为“日永月新”。永新是全国著名的“将军县”，是中央苏区县，是井冈山革命根据地的重要组成部分，是湘赣革命根据地的中心，湘赣革命根据地湘赣省委驻地，是三湾改编、龙源口战斗所在地。境内有湘赣省委机关旧址，三湾改编旧址等红色景观400多处，革命文物1万余件。永新县非物质文化遗产总数位居吉安市第一、江西省第四。\n\n2021年，永新县实现地区生产总值134亿元，增长9.6%；实现财政总收入15.46亿元，增长20.9%。\n\n## 建置沿革\n\n春秋战国时期，永新地域先后属吴、越、楚。秦灭楚后，属秦九江郡。西楚元年（前206年）项羽立英布为九江王，永新地属九江国。\n\n汉高帝四年（前203年），改九江国为淮南国，领豫章等4郡，永新地属之。其后，增庐陵县，永新地属庐陵，隶淮南国豫章郡。汉高帝十二年（前195年），封濞吴王，豫章郡庐陵县属吴王国。汉景帝三年（前154年），削吴王国之豫章等地直属朝廷。东汉建安四年（199年），孙策分扬州豫章郡设庐陵郡，并置西昌县，永新地属西昌。建安九年至二十年（215年），分扬州庐陵郡地置永新县，县治在今沙市下排洲与澧田洲头交界的高洲。\n\n吴宝鼎二年（267年），孙皓分长沙郡的安成、萍乡，豫章郡的新喻、宜春，庐陵郡的平都、永新，共6县置安成郡，隶扬州。\n\n晋太康元年（280年），安成郡划归荆州，永新县属荆州安成郡；元康元年（291年），分扬州和荆州10郡置江州，永新县属江州安成郡。\n\n隋开皇十一年（591年），废安成郡置吉州，永新并入吉州太和（今泰和）县；大业三年（607年），废州复郡，永新隶属庐陵郡太和县。\n\n唐武德五年（622年），分太和县地置南平州，永新县属之。后汉时永新并入吉州太和县；显庆二年（657年），永新属江南道吉州，县治改设禾川镇。 此后州郡名称凡经变更，永新县隶属关系未变。\n\n五代十国时期，永新县先属杨吴，后属南唐。\n宋代在州之上设路，吉州永新县始属江南路，后属江南西路；建炎四年（1130年）改属鄂州路；绍兴无年（1131年），属江南西路吉州。\n\n元至元十四年（1277年），设江西行中书省（简称江西行省或江西省），吉州路永新县属之；元贞元年（1295年），吉州路改称吉安路，永新升为州。\n\n明洪武二年（1369年），永新复为县，隶江西行省吉安府；洪武九年（1376年），永新县属江西布政使司吉安府。清朝，永新县仍属吉安府。\n民国元年（1912年），废吉安府，永新县直属于江西省；民国三年（1914年），江西省划分为四道，永新属庐陵道；民国十五年（1926年），各县仍直属于省；民国二十一年（1932年），江西全省划为13个行政区，永新属第十行政区；民国二十四年（1935年），江西省划分为8个行政区，永新属第三行政区。\n\n1949年7月28日，中国人民解放军第二野战军第十八军解放永新县城。\n\n中华人民共和国成立以后，省、县之初设大区、 专区分治，永新县属江西省赣西南区吉安专区。后废大区，改专区为地区，永新县属吉安地区。 1968年，吉安地区改称井冈山地区，永新属之。 “文化大革命”后，恢复吉安地区名称。 2000年，吉安地区改设吉安市，永新县隶属关系不变。\n\n## 行政区划\n\n### 区划沿革\n\n永新县都的划分至宋元枯七年后，全县划为73都。从县境北部的虹桥、左坊起始，大致按逆时针方向依次冠以数字序号作为都的名称，其中一部分都还分上、下都。后全县又设12乡，依次为太平、禾山、登丰、安仁、西亭、霸封、积庆、胜业、景福、才德、思贤、义和（禾）。有些都被分割成两部分，分属两乡，序号不变，仅在前面冠以乡名以示区别，如平五都（太平乡五都），禾五都（禾山乡五都）。连同上、下都计算，全县有96都。\n元至顺初，析胜业乡全乡所属四十五都至五十二都共计8都置永宁县。县内剩11乡88都。\n明初，全县维持11乡的区划。乡以下实行里甲制，每10户为甲，有甲首；每110户为里，有里长。全县共编184里。万历年间，乡、都仍其旧，都下设图，全县共设180图。\n清乾隆八年析安仁、西亭二乡及登丰乡的一部分共25都归属莲花厅，县内存9乡63都。同治年间，全县编为东、南、西、北四乡，分领63都。\n中华人民共和国成立后，永新县的境域又有变动。1950年，县内的茨坪罗浮划归遂川县。1951年，横江、大湾两乡划归宁冈县(今属井冈山市)。1958年底，撤宁冈县改称宁冈人民公社，并入永新县。1959年7月，原宁冈县的区域除杭扛、大湾、埂背、石口和高车坳归永新以外，其余均从永新析出，连同永新的拿山乡、遂川县的井冈山乡，合并成立井冈山管理局。\n\n2001年，全县进行撤乡并镇，共设25个乡镇场，325个村（居）民委员会。新划分的乡镇场为禾川、澧田、埠前、泮中、石桥、龙门、文竹、沙市、怀忠、高桥楼10个镇，曲白、坳南、烟阁、在中、才丰、台岭、高溪、高市、莲洲、象形、芦溪、龙田、三湾13个乡，七溪岭林场和永新综合垦殖场2个场。\n\n###

济阴\n\n古代地名\n\n济阴，因在济水之南而得名。汉高祖五年（公元前198年）封彭越于梁国，都城定陶。汉景帝中元六年(公元前144年)从梁国分出，始为国，为郡，治定陶（今山东菏泽市定陶区）\n。东汉时期，济阴郡属兖州八郡国之一。隋又建济阴县（定陶西南），为济阴郡附郭。唐武德四年改为曹州（治今山东曹县西北），济阴郡从汉至明存在1500多年，是中原地区的政治、经济、军事重镇。\n《史记·货殖列传》：“夫自鸿沟以东，芒、砀以北，属巨野，此梁、宋也。陶、睢阳亦一都会也。昔尧作游成阳（菏泽东北）,舜渔雷泽（鄄城东南），汤止于亳（曹县东南）。其俗犹有先王遗风，重厚多君子，好稼穑，虽无山川之饶，能恶衣食，致其蓄藏。”（司马迁把帝尧发祥于成阳，虞舜渔于雷泽，商汤兴起于亳，定位在今菏泽市境内。）## 历史背景\n\n济阴，以其地在济水之南而得名，地名从汉至明沿用1500多年。\n公元前12世纪，周武王封其六弟振铎为曹伯，建曹国，都陶丘（今菏泽市定陶区北）。《说文》：“陶丘有尧城，尧尝居之。\n自春秋至西汉800多年间，陶丘“扼菏、济之要，据淮、徐、宁、卫、燕、赵之脊”，一直是中原地区著名的水陆交通中心、经济都会和军事战略要地，享有“天下之中”的美誉。\n汉武帝建元三年（前138年）改定陶国为济阴郡。汉宣帝甘露二年(公元前52年)更名为定陶国，哀帝建平二年(公元前5年)又改为济阴郡，属兖州。\n东汉时期，初为定陶国，不久，改为济阴郡。永平十五年(公元72年)，刘长被封为济阴王，立十二年，元和元年卒，因无后，国除，复为济阴郡。延光三年(公元124年)，汉安帝太子刘保被废为济阴王，延光四年刘保即皇帝位，济阴复为郡。\n汉献帝建安十七年(公元212年)，济阴复为国。\n三国，据《补三国疆域志》载：济阴郡，领县九：定陶、冤句、成阳、乘氏、句阳、单父、成武、己氏、离狐。仍治定陶。\n\n晋，《晋书·地理志》载：兖州，济阴郡，统县九：定陶、乘氏、句阳、离狐、宛句、己氏、成武、单父、成阳。”仍治定陶。\n南北朝，先属刘宋，南朝刘宋时期，济阴与湖陆等地合并划分为高平郡、兖州郡、济阴郡三部分。元嘉末年（453年），济阴郡的一部分陷于北魏，泰始四年（469年）宋失山东，济阴郡全面归属北魏势力范围。《魏书·地形志》载：

东汉《风俗通义》：“姚墟在济阴成阳县，帝颛顼之墟，阏伯之墟是也。应劭：姚墟与雷泽近，后世称为姚城。”《郑玄诗谱》中《诗·曹风集说》：“昔尧尝游成阳，死而葬焉。舜渔于雷泽，民俗始化，其遗风重厚，多君子，务稼穑，薄衣食以致畜积。”\n三国《皇览》：“尧冢在济阴成阳。”西晋《帝王世纪》：“尧葬济阴成阳西北四十里，是为谷林。”“尧冢在济阴成阳。”尧“葬于济阴之成阳西北，是为谷林。”“尧葬谷林，谷林即成阳。”“《墨子》以为尧堂三尺，土堦三等，北教八狄。道死，葬蛩山之阴。《山海经》曰：‘尧葬狄山之阳，一名崇山。’二说各殊，以为成阳近是尧冢也。” 《晋书·地理志》：“成阳县有尧陵、灵台，舜渔雷泽在西北。”\n北魏《水经注》：“成阳有尧冢、灵台，今成阳城西二里有尧陵，陵南一里有尧母庆都陵，‘于城为西南，称日灵台，乡日崇仁，邑号修义，皆立庙。四周列水，潭而不流，水泽(指雷泽湖)通泉，泉不耗竭，至丰鱼笋，不敢采捕。前并列数碑。栝柏数株，檀马成林。二陵南北列，驰道迳通，皆以砖砌之，尚修整。尧陵东城西五十余步中山夫人祠，尧妃也。”\n唐《括地志》：“尧陵在濮州雷泽县西三里，陵南一里为灵台。” 唐《括地志》：“姚城在雷泽东十三里，即姚墟。” 唐《十道志》：“尧冢在曹州界。”唐《元和郡县图志》，宋《太平寰宇记》，同《括地志》记载。 唐《通典》：“尧冢在曹州界。” 元《文献通考》：“尧冢在曹州界。”\n\n### 济阴汤陵\n\n三国《皇览》记曰：“汤冢在济阴亳县北东郭，去县三里。冢四方，方各十步，高七尺，上平，处平地。\n汉建平元年大司空御史长卿按行水灾，因行汤冢。”梁孝元皇帝《兴王篇》有成汤“崩，葬于济阴薄县东北郭，去县三里，冢高七尺，汉哀帝时遣大司空行汤冢。”\n刘宋裴骃说：“汤冢在济阴薄县北。”（《水经注·汳水》）《水经注》又引杜预曰：“梁国蒙县西北有薄城，城中有成汤冢。”\n晋人伏滔《北征记》曰：“望蒙、亳间，成汤、伊尹、箕子之冢，今为丘墟也。”\n《汉书·地理志》晋傅瓒注曰：“汤居亳，今济阴亳县是也。今亳有汤冢，己氏有伊尹冢，皆相近也。 ”\n《曹州府志·古迹志》载：“故亳城在县南20里涂山之阳。其旁为蒙城。”《曹县志·疆域志》上又载：“在汤陵东南三里，一曰景薄，一名北亳，即此。”\n汤王陵历代都有重修，明万历《曹县志》记云：成汤祠在县南十八里土山集，不祥所始。墓前有石碣刻云：“宋皇佑四年（1052）年重修；元延佑五年（1318）重修；明宣德八年重修；成华丙申（1476）重修，李秉有记；弘治五年（149）年重修；嘉靖三十五年（1556）重修；万历九年（1581）岁次辛巳春三月八日重修。”由此可知，至迟从宋代起，官方便开始对曹县商汤陵进行重修和祭祀。\n\n##

{"name": "硕龙口岸", "documents": ["## 硕龙口岸\n硕龙口岸是中华人民共和国广西壮族自治区的一个陆路边境口岸，位于崇左市大新县硕龙镇境内，并与越南高平省下琅县的里板口岸相接。该口岸在1954年以二类口岸等级对越开放，并于2017年正式升格至一类口岸以向外开放，从而促进中越两国边境地区的人员往来以及贸易和经济发展。另一方面，硕龙口岸的税务征收、货物申报、出入境检验检疫、监管审核以及综合统计等工作则由南宁海关下属的硕龙海关负责。\n##位置和交通\n硕龙口岸位于中华人民共和国广西壮族自治区崇左市大新县硕龙镇境内，距离大新县县城、崇左市江州区以及自治区首府南宁市分别为45公里、76公里和190公里，而两个相邻口岸龙邦口岸以及水口口岸则分别与其相距150公里和130公里。该口岸邻近中越边界第847号界标以及归春河，并与越南高平省下琅县的里板口岸相接，而距离下琅县县城和省莅高平市则分别是约30公里以及约105公里。此外硕龙口岸还是处于德天—板约瀑布跨境旅游合作区辐射范围之内，并能在中越跨境旅游合作开发中发挥作用，成为以出入境旅游为主的陆路口岸。\n交通方面，硕龙口岸直接与S3259沿边公路相接，六公里之外则有S316省道，而距离崇左—靖西高速公路（现已合并至合那高速公路）大新出入口则约10公里。另一方面，隆安—硕龙高速公路已于2017年12月22日正式开工，预计总工期为四年，落成启用后全国高速公路网将能直达至硕龙口岸。\n##历史\n1954年，中华人民共和国国务院批准在广西省崇左专区大新县境内设立一个二类口岸，并将其命名作硕龙口岸，为当时21个中越陆路边境口岸之一。1978年末，该口岸因中越关系每况愈下而被迫关闭，直到1991年两国关系正常化后才恢复贸易往来，但尚未正式完全开放。2009年11月18日，时任中华人民共和国外交部副部长武大伟和时任越南外交部副部长胡春山于中华人民共和国北京市签署《中华人民共和国政府和越南社会主义共和国政府关于中越陆地边境口岸及其管理制度的协定》，双方同意硕龙口岸与对方的里板口岸在条件具备时才会对外开放，而其开放时间以及通行方式将由外交途径商定。\n以往由于硕龙口岸各项基础设施尚未完善和长期不能正式开放，所以它只能以边民互市贸易方式与越南对接，并严重限制两国经贸的进一步往来以及邻近的德天瀑布相关旅游产业发展。中国共产党大新县委员会和大新县人民政府为了改善上述情况以及抓紧泛北部湾经济合作区启动建设与中国―东盟自由贸易区成立所带来的机遇，便在2012年成立口岸经济工作领导小组，加大力度推展口岸建设和开放。2013年6月，中华人民共和国海关总署把硕龙口岸列入年度国家口岸开放审理计划，一年八个月后广西壮族自治区人民政府向国务院申请将其升格为一类口岸，随后国家口岸管理办公室于2015年9月向中华人民共和国外交部边界与海洋事务司致函，请求就硕龙口岸升格和开放事宜照会越南，望越方予以研究并尽快向中方回复。此外广西壮族自治区也向国家海关总署申请，把该口岸升格至国际性口岸一事纳入到国家「十三五」规划纲要当中。\n经过多方努力后，国务院终于在2017年10月8日批准硕龙口岸正式对外开放，其性质是双边性常年开放一级公路客货运输口岸。后来中越双方于2019年3月28日签署《中越陆地边界联委会第九次会议纪要》，同意推动硕龙口岸以及里板口岸共同升格为国际性口岸，接著广西壮族自治区口岸办公室在翌年2月13日向国家口岸管理办公室请求再次透过外交管道向越方照会口岸升格事宜。截至2021年11月，此项工作仍在进行当中。\n##设施\n硕龙口岸一期工程设施包括旅检大楼、配电房、水泵房和牌坊，总建筑面积以及总投资额分别是13767平方米和约两亿人民币。这项工程于2018年开工，并在两年后基本完成，其中旅检大楼每年可以办理100万人次出入境。另一方面，该口岸还设有一个每年能够处理超过300万吨货物的口岸配套货场，以及一个已于2017年10月投入使用的口岸边检站监护中队新营区。\n##过境货物和统计\n硕龙口岸向越南出境的货物包括机电产品、建材、农药、化肥、布匹、服装以及其他日常生活用品，而自越方入境的货物则有中草药、林木、果类、稻米、木薯、坚果和锰矿石。此外总计2013年全年，该口岸共进出口1700吨货物，而出入境人数则是8.8万人次。", "# 硕龙口岸\n\n广西与越南交界处的国家二类口岸\n\n硕龙口岸位于中国广西崇左市大新县西北的归春河边，广西与越南西路49号界碑处，其对面是越南的里板口岸。硕龙口岸距大新县城45公里，距靖西市龙邦口岸140公里，距龙州水口口岸130公里；西与越南高平省接壤，距越南高平省105公里，距高平省重庆县城38公里，下琅县城30公里。## 简介\n\n大新县硕龙口岸是1954年经国务院批准设立的国家二类口岸，是当时批准在中越边境设立的21个边境陆路口岸之一。该口岸位于中越边境846号界碑处，距国家特级景点，“亚洲第一跨国瀑布”——德天瀑布14公里；与越南高平省下琅县接壤，与硕龙口岸对应的是越南里板口岸。\n\n## 主要特点\n\n近年来，随着中国—东盟自由贸易区蓬勃发展，泛北部湾经济合作和大湄公河次区域合作的升温，“一轴两翼”经济合作新格局的提出及实施，硕龙口岸成为了中国—东盟国际大通道的重要组成部分。为此，根据《崇左市口岸总体规划》，硕龙口岸总体规划为以国际出入境旅游业、矿产品进出口为主，兼具边境小额贸易和边民互市贸易的口岸。口岸发展总体设想是：结合德天跨国瀑布景区的开发，将硕龙口岸建设成集跨国旅游、边境贸易、人文交流于一体的口岸；口岸基础设施建设按一类口岸的配套规模进行规划建设，口岸设计通关能力为客运量35万人次/年，货运量50万吨/年。2004年10月，完成了硕龙口岸总体规划设计。2008年7月完成了硕龙口岸详细规划设计。\n\n## 基础设施\n\n2002年自治区人民政府拨款240万元建设联检楼，该项目已于2004年7月份开工建设，预计2005年9月底可竣工交付使用。“十一五”期间将重点续建口岸联检楼、建设验货场、口岸货物车辆通道等基础设施，建设检验检疫部门生活用房、边检站营区、完善联检部门内部设备、完善供电、供排水系统等配套设施。据介绍，硕龙口岸对面的越南里板口岸于2005年3月底前已新建5栋新的办公值班用房，里板至其里国社8公里长的公路正加紧施工中（主要是扩宽路面和降低山路坡度）。随着中国-东盟自由贸易区的建立，和“两廊一圈”经济区构想的实施，中国和东盟的商务活动和旅游日趋频繁，硕龙口岸物流和客流将快速增长，开放空间和层次将普遍提高，该口岸将成为桂西南通往越南以及东南亚各国的重要陆路通道之一。\n\n## 贸易情况\n\n据统计，2004年贸易量8500吨，交易额2420万元。2005年贸易量10784吨，交易额1929万元。2006年贸易量13080吨，交易额2340万元。2007年贸易量29949吨，交易额11770万元。2008年硕龙口岸出入境人员7.8万人次，进出口货物6.95万吨，进出口贸易额达2588万美元。今年1—10月出入境人员6万人次，进出口货物4.36万吨，进出口贸易额达1418万美元。\n\n## 周围景点\n\n硕龙镇原名\"石龙\"，因从骨屯沿归春河的山岭走向形似巨龙而名。镇内有黑水河、归春河、跃进水渠贯穿全境，水利水电资源十分丰富。二本镇旅游资源也十分丰富，有世界第二大跨国瀑布--德天瀑布，有九龙滩瀑布、沙屯叠瀑、世外桃源般的黑水河漂游，门村老视木王，还有中法战争古炮台等景点。全年到景区的国内外游客34.60万人，旅游收入4704万元。边境贸易总额2470万元。"],

历史沿革\n\n### 名称由来\n\n吉隆，为藏语“舒适村”、“欢乐村”之意寓。吉隆之得名，传说是公元8世纪后期，赤松德赞从印度迎请莲花生大师入藏时，大师一行途经吉隆沟（今吉隆镇一带），曾在此住了一宿。大师见此地山清水秀，风景明媚，不胜感概，又溪谷中的河水洁白如乳，溪底的卵石光润如玉，更是赞叹不已。于是，在翌日临行之前，，欣然命名此地为“吉隆”，以表达其无限赞誉之情，“吉隆”之称谓遂流传至今。在旧文中也写作“济咙”、“济隆”、“吉仲”等。\n\n### 建制沿革\n\n元朝时曾有官员到吉隆处理要事。1778年到1781年间，清朝中央政府曾派兵到吉隆抵御廓尔喀入侵西藏。西藏和平解放前有宗嘎上宗、下宗、吉隆东宗、西宗共四个宗。1960年7月宗嘎上、下宗，吉隆东、西宗合并成立吉隆县人民政府。属日喀则地区。\n2014年7月，日喀则撤地设市，吉隆县属于日喀则市。\n\n## 行政区划\n\n###

教育事业\n\n吉隆县学龄儿童入学率达到86.9%，比上年提高10.9%，青壮年文盲率继续下降。 西藏和平解放以前，吉隆县教育被寺院贵族垄断，教育将人民群众置于门外。人民群众倍受愚昧、落后、不识字的痛苦。西藏和平解放以后，吉隆县教育得到空前发展。\n1961年吉隆县历史上第一所公办小学建立，当时只有1名教师，在校生8名。1961－2000年底，县小学入学率达到76&，共培养初中毕业生358名，考取内地西藏班109人。\n2004年完成“普六”任务，2005年顺利完成“扫盲”验收，我县“普九”顺利通过自治区、地区验收。到目前，全县共有各类学校15所，小学在校学生1967人，适龄儿童入学率98.05%，巩固率100%，初中在校生757人，入学率90.71%。\n\n### 医疗卫生\n\n西藏和平解放以前，吉隆县没有专门的医疗卫生机构，和平解放以后成立了卫生管理机构管理执行有关卫生的事务。\n70年代末80年代初医疗卫生工作主要以县卫生院为中心，开展综合性业务工作，随着国民经济的不断发展，医疗卫生事业的投入随之增多，业务范围也逐步扩大。\n防疫工作以预防为主，积极开展传染病、地方病的防治，实施各项卫生测定、卫生监督。\n从80年代起，积极开展乡村医生的培训培养工作，先后派出20余人到区内各大医院或到内地进行培训深造。80年代末90年代初，医学专业毕业生不断分配到县医院，提高了技术质量和业务水平。农村合作医疗全面推开，医疗卫生保障体系的建立正在进行。\n截止到2014年，农牧民群众参与率达87%。全县有医疗机构6所，医务人员33人，拥有床位30张。人口自然增长率控制在11‰以内。\n\n### 通讯事业\n\n截止到2014年，吉隆县建成53座村级广播电视“村村通”工作站，广播电视覆盖率达100%。\n\n### 文化事业\n\n党的十一届三中全会以后，各族群众在党和政府的带领下，治穷致富，发展经济，生活得到较大改善，生活质量有了提高。为了歌颂党的富民政策，歌唱社会主义新生活，群众自编自导，产生了有一定艺术性、可观赏性的文艺作品。电影“2131”工程扎实深入推进，全年为农牧民免费放映电影1200场次，其中故事片1095场次，科教片105场次，观众达14.4万人次。\n\n### 宗教事业\n\n吉隆全县有4座寺庙、4座拉康。即曲德寺、查嘎达索寺、顿珠林寺、帕巴寺、玛尼拉康、加木拉康、强巴拉康、门康拉康。共有僧尼37人。曲德寺属黄教；查嘎达索寺属噶举派；顿珠林寺属宁玛派；帕巴寺属黄教，主供佛；4座拉康属宁玛派。\n\n## 交通概况\n\n吉隆县紧邻国道219线，连接着日喀则市，众多的县道、乡道，交通便利。\n吉隆县南面和西南面同尼泊尔王国接壤，边境线长162公里，自古就是西藏与尼泊尔交往通商的要道。1961年设立海关，作为开放口岸，1978年吉隆镇被国务院确定为国家一级陆路通商口岸。\n2019年11月26日，开通6条农村客运班线，分别为吉隆县—吉隆镇、吉隆县—差那乡、吉隆县—折巴乡、吉隆县—贡当乡、吉隆镇—萨勒乡、吉隆镇—吉隆口岸，共配备11辆班车，覆盖了6个乡镇。\n\n## 旅游资源\n\n吉隆县具有众多的人文景点和丰厚的历史文化。全县有“大唐天竺使出铭”、曲德寺、卓玛拉康三个国家级文物保护单位；有著名的与拉萨大昭寺建于同期的帕巴寺、强真寺等藏传佛教寺庙；有三趾马化石遗址；有米拉日巴修行洞；有异国建筑风格的寺庙；有独特的民间手镯舞艺术等。\n吉隆县是西藏同纬度地带自然条件比较独特的地区之一，自然生态环境结构复杂，北部为湖盆草原地带，中部为湖盆河谷地带，南部为高山峡谷地带。境内有高达8012米的希夏邦玛峰；有神奇的佩枯湖、白湖、黑湖、红湖和冰湖；有郁郁葱葱的原始森林；有水温高达60－70度的温泉10多个；有高达200米的瀑布。\n强准祖布拉康\n强准祖布拉康（以下简称强堆寺）位于吉隆镇的邦兴村，东距县林管站200米。寺庙为木结构楼阁式建筑，塔身方形，底层最大宽度为22米。塔之底层以片石垒砌墙体，外抹泥墙，第2、3、4层皆以小型炎砖砌筑，各层檐面皆以原木斫成梁架椽枋，其上铺盖以石板。\n“文革”时期，寺庙毁弃。1986年经吉隆县人民政府批准，予以重新恢复。\n帕巴寺\n帕巴寺位于被称之为“圣城”的古代中尼、中印交通重镇吉隆镇的一座千年古寺，它位于现吉隆镇政府所在地之东侧约有30米，海拔2850米处。\n帕巴寺的始建年代，据传松赞干布迎请尼泊尔赤尊公主，在边镇所建立的镇边寺庙之一。其建筑风格主要依照了尼泊尔寺庙的格式。\n卓玛拉康\n卓玛拉康位于吉隆县县城城区南隅，曲德寺西南，原贡塘王城遗址的中部，海拔4160米。\n卓玛拉康的始建年代，据文献记载“该庙宇竣工于藏俗第5绕迥之庚午”，公元1274年，也就是卓玛拉康的始建年代。\n桑丹林寺\n桑丹林寺北距吉隆镇40公里，位于海拔约4500米的丹林沟内。\n寺内收藏有《丹珠尔》、《甘珠尔》经书一套以及《亚不赛》经书一套21部，《索郎吐布》经书一套18卷。\n桑丹林寺为格鲁派寺院，据实地调查，建寺至今已有480多年，寺庙人数最多时达到80人左右。\n寺庙在1966年——1969年“文革”时期被毁，仅存建筑遗址“阿瓦呷英摩岩题铭”（大唐天竺使出铭）\n贡塘王城遗址\n贡塘王城遗址大约建于公元11世纪前后，地处吉隆县城东南。城址现存4段：即西南角楼、南恒西段、南恒东段、及角一楼、东恒、夯土城墙，卵石勒脚，四角筑有角楼，城恒中段筑有碉堡。另有内城恒，城内有古寺卓玛拉康。遗址约分为5个建筑时期，始建于第六代贡塘王拉觉德，终于第十七代贡塘王赤拉旺坚时期。\n擦木卡战场遗址\n古战场地处吉隆县擦木卡沟内，形成于清代。古战场由一系列完整的御工事组成，包括有护恒、单兵掩体、隐蔽部等。系清代乾隆年间清军反击廓尔喀侵略者的遗址。\n哈东淌旧石器遗址：哈东淌旧石器地点在宗嘎镇哈东沟，形成于旧石器时代。\n遗址位于吉隆藏布河东岸二级阶地，标本采集范围约2000平方米，采集旧石器标本砍砸器、砍斫器、刮削器等近百件。\n却得淌旧石器遗址\n遗址在宗嘎镇烈士墓地北侧，形成于旧石器时代。\n遗址位于吉隆藏布上游二级阶地，标本采集范围约1000平方米。采集标本共11件，种类包括刮削器、切割器、砍器等。\n\n## 风俗习惯\n\n### 藏戏\n\n随着时代不断前进，人民群众生活水平的提高和对文化生活的需求，传统的《卓桑姆》《朗沙哦布》《索吉尼玛》《白玛伟巴》《顿叶顿珠》等八大藏戏的格调在许多方面落后于时代，人民群众为使藏戏更能贴近生活，表现生活，对藏戏稍有改进，如八大藏戏的唱词、动作、配器等均有改进，使藏戏表演更具特色。\n\n### 音乐舞蹈\n\n（1）音乐，1985－1999年，在县文化工作人员的组织下，职工业余表演队在表演过程中创作了一些音乐作品，如《计划生育好》《家乡变了样》《幸福生活》等歌曲，激励着吉隆人民用勤劳智慧建设幸福的家园。\n（2）舞蹈，1989年以来，吉隆县组织群众以民间舞蹈为题材，经过粗略的提炼，编排出《吉隆锅庄》《呀拉北京》《盖新房》《筑墙》《哈达献给共产党》等舞蹈，极大地丰富了人民群众的文化生活。\n\n### 民间文艺\n\n大量古遗址的发现，说明吉隆县在唐宋时期民间歌舞已初具雏形，出现了独具地方特色的《统加舞》（也叫手镯舞）以及祭祀舞《哈玛》。明清以后，随着各民族的交往不断加强，《马灯舞》等传入吉隆县。1989年以来，地区专业和业余文艺工作者不断深入该县，搜集整理出一些民间舞蹈素材，编排了很有影响的节目。\n乐器主要有：莽筒（宗教仪式吹奏乐器，藏语叫热阿冻）、羊皮鼓、藏鼓、钹、骨号等。\n\n### 民歌\n\n由于吉隆县地理环境的差异，民歌演唱的体裁、音韵、调式和其他地方存在着明显的不同。流传至今的情歌、颂歌、悲歌等有固定的唱腔和句式，一首曲调可唱若干段词。草地乐歌的音域宽广，热情奔放，音韵连贯，节奏自由，展现出牧民豪放的性格。\n民歌有情歌、颂歌、悲歌、劳动歌、酒歌。\n\n### 体育\n\n吉隆人民素以能骑善射，民风强悍著称。从松赞干布时代起，赛马就是农牧民群众喜闻乐见、赏心悦目的体育活动，从呐喊助威到马上驰骋，从跑马射箭到马术表演，都使农牧民兴趣盎然。至近代，吉隆骑射活动不但盛行不衰，而因地域文化的差异各具特色。20世纪60年代，在吉隆镇、贡当乡、差那乡等地开展马上梭标掷投的群众性体育活动较为普遍。\n各乡镇体育比赛活动一般在藏历7月进行，因为牧区海拔比较高，空气稀薄，马不耐久驰骋的缘故，赛场少有超过2000米的。赛马会上各村男女老少聚集，帷幕连绵，是草地上盛大的节日，参加赛马的成年男子均为赤足无鞍骑赛。\n自20世纪80年代以来，吉隆县把每年的8月1日定为传统节日，在节日期间，各乡镇文艺表演队和体育活动参赛人员聚集县城的草坪坝上，进行各种体育活动，如拔河比赛、赛马、射箭、抱石头等。\n体育活动主要有：滑雪、围多（又叫甩皮绳）、赛牦牛、抱石头、丢窝窝、转山、举皮袋等。\n\n##

位置境域\n\n舟山市位于长江口南侧、杭州湾外缘的东海海域。舟山群岛由嵊泗列岛、马鞍列岛、崎岖列岛、川湖列岛、中街山列岛、浪岗山列岛、七姊八妹列岛、火山列岛和梅散列岛组成。地理坐标北纬29°32′—31°04′，东经121°30′—123°25′。东濒太平洋，南接象山县海界，西临杭州湾，北与上海市海界相接。处中国沿海南北航线与长江水道交汇点，北靠长三角经济区，是中国南北海运和远东国际航线的主通道之一。境域东西长182千米，南北宽169千米，总面积2.22万平方千米，其中海域面积2.08万平方千米。4696个岛礁陆地总面积1440.2平方千米。\n\n### 地形地貌\n\n舟山市境地质构造复杂。地层大部分为中生界侏罗系、白垩系火山——沉积岩所覆盖，偶见上古生界变质岩系露头，新生界第四系分布在各岛边缘。境内广布巨厚的中生代火山岩，有火山喷岩、侵入岩、变质岩三大类。群岛呈西南－东北走向排列，地势由西南向东北倾斜，南部岛大，海拔高，排列密集；北部岛小，地势低，分布稀疏。岛上丘陵起伏，高丘占9%，低丘占61%，平原30%，形成不同土壤类型及农作利用格局。桃花岛对峙山为最高峰，海拔544米。多数岛屿山峰在海拔200米以下，南半地势差400米。海岸线总长2444千米，其中基岩海岸1855千米，人工海岸（海塘）530千米，砂砾海岸50千米，泥质海岸（涂）13千米。水深15米以上岸线200.7千米，水深20米以上岸线103.7千米。\n\n### 气候\n\n舟山市四面环海，属亚热带季风气候，冬暖夏凉，温和湿润，光照充足。年平均气温16℃左右，最热8月，平均气温25.8—28.0℃；最冷1月，平均气温5.2—5.9℃。常年降水量927—1620毫米。年平均日照1941—2257小时，太阳辐射总量为4126×10⁶—4598×10⁶焦尔/平方米，无霜期251—303天，适宜各种生物群落繁衍、生长，给渔农业生产提供了相当有利的条件。空气自然净化能力强，温差变化小。由于受季风不稳定性的影响，夏秋之际易受热带风暴（台风）侵袭，冬季多大风，七八月间出现干旱，是舟山常见的灾害性天气。\n\n朱家尖大青山国家公园\n\n### 水文\n\n舟山市水文情况复杂，地表水系不发育，多源自丘陵腹地，呈放射状蜿蜒入海。水系受海岛规模影响，流程短，汇水面积小，受暴雨影响，水位暴涨暴落，易引发山洪等自然灾害。海岸潮汐属不规则的半日潮，潮流以往复流为特征，涨潮流向西，落潮流向东，涨潮流速大于落潮流速。海水的潮汐及台风巨浪作用对岛屿海滨的影响较大，尤其是潮间带地段。\n\n岱山海岬公园\n\n### 地质\n\n舟山市属于华南地层区东南沿海分区舟山小区，出露地层主要有上侏罗统和第四系。上侏罗统以中酸—酸性火山碎屑岩为主，少量酸性熔岩和火山沉积岩，属钙碱性系列或弱碱性岩系。第四系松散沉积物分布在海积、冲海积平原区和山麓沟谷地带，厚度变化较大。\n舟山市位于华南褶皱系浙东南褶皱带丽水—宁波隆起新昌—定海断隆的东北部，也是浙闽沿海燕山期火山活动带的北段，温州—镇海北北东向大断裂带从编图区西部海域通过，昌化—普陀东西向大断裂带位于编图区以南，龙泉—宁波北东向断裂带斜贯编图区。在长期的地壳运动中，它们逐步发展，与北西、北北西和南北向断裂共同组成了纵横交错的基本断裂格架，并对编图区火山机构、沉积盆地的形成和发展，对地形地貌的变迁具有控制作用。\n\n嵊山东崖绝壁\n\n## 自然资源\n\n### 水资源\n\n舟山市源于境土相对空间的大气降水，降水时空分布欠匀，蓄水条件欠好，地表径流多数直接入海，淡水资源总量欠丰，尤以北东部诸岛为甚。多年平均降水量1108.85毫米，多年平均相对湿度78.5%，水资源总量5.74亿立方米，人均拥有量为浙江省人均的25.4%，耕地亩均占有河川径流量为浙江省亩均的51.2%，平均年径流深为浙江省的51%。地下水资源量1.73亿立方米，露头泉分布点少而不匀，多见季节性泉。在变质岩和花岗岩分布区的沟谷平原，地下水富集，第四系洪积和冲积砂砾带，孔隙潜水和承压水丰富，单井涌量在100—1000吨/日。海积平原砂砾滩地下水丰富，但因有海水参与和输送不便，利用较少。花岗岩裂隙带，地下水质优良，但总量欠丰。\n\n### 生物资源\n\n舟山市境内植被属中国中亚热带常绿阔叶林北部亚地带，浙江省植被区划中属天台山、括苍山山地岛屿植被片。随地形由低及高和土质变化，形成泥涂植被、砂地植被、岩礁植被和山地植被等。境内有木本植物544种，隶89科，内古树名木63种。兽类主要有18种，分隶6目10科；鸟类主要有164种，分隶17目40科，其中白鹳为国家一级重点保护野生动物；两栖类主要有8种，分隶5科，多属蛙类，偶见山溪鲵等；爬行类主要有24种，分隶8科；淡水鱼类主要有26种，分隶4目9科。\n\n### 矿产资源\n\n舟山市现发现有铜、铅、锌、金、银、硫铁矿、铁、明矾石、地热及建筑用石料等10个矿种，矿产地4处。矿产资源特点是非金属矿产建筑用石料矿丰富；除此以外，其他金属、非金属和能源矿产资源贫乏。\n（1）金属矿产\n后岙铅锌矿为矿（化）点，分布在定海区白泉镇，量少，品位低，不具备开采经济价值；冷峙铅锌矿为小型矿床，分布在岱山县衢山镇，矿山多年开采，资源量枯竭，已闭坑；龙王山铅铜矿为矿化点，分布在岱山县高亭镇，品位低，不具开采经济价值。\n（2）非金属矿产\n建筑用石料：岩性为凝灰岩、花岗岩，分布广，资源量大。可开采加工成碎石、机制砂，作混凝土粗细骨料；或作宕渣开采，用作工程填料。\n（3）能源矿产\n岱山县秀山乡吽唬村XRT4井地热水温低、水量小，不宜开发利用。\n\n普陀区街景\n\n##

历史文化\n\n### 舟山精神\n\n“勇立潮头、海纳百川、同舟共济、求真务实”的舟山精神，既是舟山市自古以来人文精神的沉淀和积累，更是舟山改革开放三十年中，顺应海洋文化的文脉，发展、革新、创造的属于这座城市独有的新文化。\n\n### 艺术\n\n舟山市的定海古城是海洋历史文化遗产，古迹众多，1991年被浙江省政府批准为浙江省首批历史文化名城。\n\n舟山方言\n舟山话，是一种吴语方言，属于吴语太湖片甬江小片。\n舟山话有29个声母，46个韵母，7个声调。\n渔民号子\n舟山渔民号子，是舟山群岛船渔工号子的总称，是舟山各岛渔民、船工世代相传的海洋民间口头音乐，它与渔船、运输船作业和渔（船）民在海上和岸上劳动时息息相伴，是浙江省乃至国内的代表性民间劳动号子之一。\n舟山锣鼓\n舟山锣鼓以锣、鼓、钹及锁呐为基调，间以丝竹，音响雄壮，旋律激荡奔放，气氛极为热烈，具有鲜明海岛特色。解放后这一民间艺术，经过加工改进慢慢地搬上了舞台。主要作品有《渔舟凯歌》《东海渔歌》《渔民欢乐》等。\n祭海\n渔民每泛出海之前，先要在船上祭祀神祇，烧化疏牒，俗称“行文书”。然后由老大将杯中酒与盘中肉抛入大海，称“酬游魂”，以求出海打鱼时平安无事。祭祀时要放一副“太平坊”，即棺材板，出海时，放在船上。棺材板冠以“太平坊”之名，与渔民在大海作业时很有可能被巨浪吞噬相关。葬身大海是渔民大忌，与“入土为安”的习俗大相径庭。因此放一副棺材板，以求太平无事。若死，也得死在家里，才能“入土为安”。这与他们到市场上去买床，不愿买新的，却要买一张已死过人的，以求到老能死在床上的愿望相一致。一泛结束，亦要举行祭祀神祇，称“谢洋”。\n潮魂\n旧时沿海渔村一种特殊的丧俗。出海渔民翻船而死的人，因无法寻得尸体。家中设灵堂，海边搭草棚设“醮台”。傍晚举行招魂仪式，在草棚里点香烛，放供品，稻草人坐中间，上贴死者生辰八字。夜间涨潮时，道士坐“醮台”上，敲响钟磬铙钹，念咒语。有人手扶一根手竹，上挂箩筐，内装雄鸡一只，面对大海，随道士咒语，不停摇动。也有由死者家属披麻戴孝，提着灯笼高呼死者名字，为其招魂。第二日将稻草人放入空棺材安葬。\n跳灶会\n跳蚤会，又名跳灶会，系流传于舟山白泉的民俗舞蹈，因舞姿如跳蚤和妇女跳到灶上撒尿就能灭火的传说而得名。它的形式是男女对舞，男饰济公，女扮火神（男扮女装其装为红衣绿裤），意为“济公斗火神”。行会时，他（她）俩由粗草绳围成长方形，边舞边唱，唱法似“小热昏”一般，除原准备的曲调外，能触景生情，见机应唱，能吸引围观者兴趣。\n唱蓬蓬\n唱蓬蓬即唱新闻，指乐师借助伴奏，将时事新闻和评论说唱给众人听，并获取一定的报酬。\n滃洲走书\n舟山走书（又名滃州走书）源于定海马岙，是舟山群岛历史文化奇葩之一，约产生于1800年前后，后从六横传至镇海后，演化为“蛟川走书”。初为自击自唱的单口说唱曲艺，内容以短词为主，原为一人自鼓自唱，后吸取戏剧中的走、唱、念、表相结合的表演手法，将单档坐唱改为二人或多人演唱。常规演出为1人主唱，辅1-2人伴奏（帮腔和笛）。其基本调为“慢调”与“急赋”，另吸收其他曲乐中的“二簧”、“流水”等曲调。演唱朴实，清晰“四工合”帮腔为其特性音调，以唱、表白、演为主要表演形式。\n贝雕渔民画\n舟山贝雕是利用当地的贝壳作原料，根据贝壳的天然色彩、光泽、纹理，精雕成神形兼备的风景、人物、山水、花鸟等画屏的工艺美术品。\n海岛渔民画\n舟山市海岛渔民画，是海岛地区特有的一种绘画艺术，以衢山鼠浪湖渔民画和东极渔民画最为有名。\n\n## 著名人物\n\n近代以来，舟山籍的国家政要及海内外爱国人士有原全国人大常委会副委员长李铁映之生母金维映，原全国人大常委会委员长乔石、原全国政协副主席丁光训、香港首任行政长官董建华、原香港贸易发展局主席和全国政协副主席安子介、原香港特别行政区行政长官林郑月娥、工业和信息化部部长金壮龙\n等；在台湾的舟山籍政要有邱进益等。\n舟山商人是中国近代化的先驱，在清末民国的“十里洋场”上海，舟山产生了朱葆三、周祥生、刘鸿生、王启宇、叶友才、许廷佐、袁仰安等工商业巨子。\n二战以后，舟山商人转移到香港、北美等地，出现了董建华家族（董浩云、董建华、董建成等）、王统元家族（王统元、王福元、梁王培芳、王国旌等）、王惟翰、厉树雄、方新道、周亦卿、杨良鋆、许志勤等。其中，董建华、安子介、林郑月娥等成为香港政要。改革开放以来，舟山商人的代表为杨元庆、胡海平、赵文权、姬十三、宋卫平、夏赛丽等。\n在文艺、科技界，古代有张信状元及第，浙东学派黄氏父子（黄式三、黄以周）“传经明道”。近代以来，文学界有三毛、桑品载、何为、金性尧、王永年等享誉文坛，影视界有王家卫、苗侨伟、林忆莲、何赛飞、陈叙一等，戏曲界有梅兰芳外孙范梅强、京剧名家费名琰、越剧名家王志萍等，科技界的舟山籍两院院士有王自强、殷鸿福、舒兴田、陈联寿、方肇伦等，还有美国科学促进会院士周如鸿、美国内科学会院士和加拿大皇家内科学院院士陈崇实等知名海外院士。\n\n##

历史\n###古代\n春秋时，舟山属越，称“甬东”（甬江之东），又喻称“海中洲”。战国时，楚灭越后属楚。秦朝时，舟山群岛属会稽郡鄮县。隋开皇九年（589年），改会稽郡为吴州，舟山群岛属句章县。\n唐开元二十六年（738年）置县，以境内有翁山而命名为翁山县，属明州，史上群岛置县之始。县治位于镇鳌山麓，筑周长五里的城池，城市开始发展。33年后，至大历六年（771年），翁山县因被袁晁率起义军占领而被撤废县治，重新归鄮县。\n北宋年间，朝廷在全面分析海上丝绸之路贸易之后，认识到舟山群岛海岛防务对发展经济、保护贸易的重要意义。在宰相王安石的建议下，北宋熙宁六年（1073年）六月，宋神宗赵顼颁诏，以旧翁山县地重建县治。由于认识到海岛的区位优势，故弃用了原「翁山」之名，以「富国强兵」之意改称昌国县，「意其东控日本，北接登莱，南连瓯闽，西通吴会，实海中之巨障，足以昌壮国势焉。」下辖富都、安期、蓬莱、金塘四乡，县治处富都乡的镇鳌山麓，全面开展城池建设。今六横岛太平庙中有王安石像。\n元至元十五年（1278年），因第二次东征日本的需要，升县为昌国州，实行州直管乡。元至元十七年（1280年），复置县，与州并存。元至元二十七年，撤县复州。元代昌国有6处城门：东江门、艮门、南门、舟山门、西门、上荣门。\n明朝洪武二年（1369年）又降为昌国县。洪武十二年（1379年）复修城，开了四个城门：丰阜（东门）、永安（南门）、文明（西门）、太和（东门）。洪武十九年（1386年）受倭寇和海盗影响，明朝廷实行「禁海徙民」政策，直接废除昌国县，将四乡合并为一昌国乡，属定海县（现宁波镇海）。洪武二十年（1387年），将舟山岛城区和镇外的居民和其他46山（岛）的居民徙迁内陆，舟山群岛人口减少，经济倒退。\n十六世纪二十年代，葡萄牙人到达舟山，在部分本地商人与海盗的配合下建立了港口进行贸易走私。明嘉靖二十七年（1548年），浙江巡抚朱纨派都指挥卢镗率兵进攻被葡萄牙人占领的舟山佛渡岛双屿港。数百葡萄牙人被杀，其余则乘船离开。嘉靖三十三年（1554年），倭寇入城洗劫，城内部分建筑受损。清顺治八年（1651年），清军攻占舟山岛，城墙再毁。\n清朝康熙取得台湾后，沿海解禁，舟山群岛人口日增。清康熙二十六年五月（1687年6月）再次设县，因认为“舟”字动而不稳，直接将其定名为定海山（县则称定海县）——「海定则波宁」, 以祈「海波永定」。原定海县治实位于浙江大陆（即今宁波市镇海区），为此，原定海县同时更名为镇海县。康熙题字之牌匾现存于定海一中。\n###鸦片战争以后\n第一次鸦片战争期间（1840-1842年）英军两度占领宁波的定海。第一次英军不攻广州，转攻沿海各城，及攻陷定海。后清庭打发回广州海域等候撤军。第二次因双方不满，而重新开战。北上攻陷沿岸各城，再占定海，攻到江宁城外，清廷议和。两次英军以清制，自行设衙门管治。按江宁条约所定，道光二十六年（1846年）英军撤军。\n鸦片战争之后，道光二十一年（1841年），海防紧张，定海县升格为定海直隶厅，直属浙江省，这是舟山地区首次升格。4月，钦差大臣裕谦以「厅城三面皆环山，南道头独滨海无藩蔽」奏请朝廷批准建道头「道头」在吴语宁波话中为「码头」之意土城。土城设「久安」「长治」两城门，城上设有炮位。今定海海滨公园有「定海道头」之牌匾。\n### 中华民国时期\n清宣统三年九月（1911年11月），拥护辛亥革命的宁波民军接收了定海直隶厅，废厅改县，重新归属于宁波市管辖。\n1937年日本全面侵华，舟山落入日军之手。1942年10月1日，日本军船里斯本丸运英国战俘往日本，中途在舟山被美国太平洋舰队潜艇部队第81分队的“鲈鱼”号发射鱼雷击中，日军弃船，千多名英军战俘遇害。 当地中国渔民义救出300多名英国军人。\n1945年，日本战败投降，舟山复归中华民国。民国三十八年（1949年），因战时需要，定海县被中华民国政府分为定海、滃州（岱山县前身）两县，马迹山以北苏属各岛设立江苏省嵊泗县。国军在大陆全线溃败后，仍以舟山群岛为主要立足点之一，对大陆长江口地区不断进行袭扰，定海机场建成后，国军利用其对上海、南京、杭州等城市进行了猛烈轰炸；其中以上海遭受轰炸尤其严重，使得这一工业城市几乎陷入无法生产的境地，尤以上海二六大轰炸为著名。国军对大陆沿海地区的突袭，造成了华东军区攻占舟山群岛的决心，并于1949年8月至1950年5月发生舟山战役。1949年10月11日至14日，蒋中正曾亲自到舟山群岛，调动兵力最终使得舟山群岛的国军增至9万人，同时加强登步岛上的防御工事，希望能够守住舟山本岛。1950年4月底，蒋根据台湾优先的原则，决定从舟山群岛撤军。1950年5月13日夜至16日拂晓，驻舟山的中华民国国军秘密自舟山撤退，滃州县实际解散，是为舟山撤退。\n### 中华人民共和国时期\n1950年5月17日，华东军区第三野战军正式进占舟山群岛，该日被中国大陆政府定为「舟山解放纪念日」。同年成立定海县人民政府，属宁波专区管辖。1953年3月经政务院批准，定海县辖区分为定海县、普陀县、岱山县3县，并从江苏省划入嵊泗县，成立舟山专区。1954年象山县自宁波专区划入，但在1958年转划归台州专区。1959年撤定海、普陀、岱山、嵊泗县，合并成立舟山县，舟山专区仅辖舟山1县。1960年1月4日，舟山专区撤消，舟山县改属宁波专区。同年11月，所属嵊泗人民公社划归上海市。1962年5月重新设立舟山专区，并撤销舟山县，改分为定海、普陀、岱山、大衢、嵊泗（自上海归还后设县）5县。1964年大衢县撤销，其辖区分别划归岱山、嵊泗2县。1967年3月起舟山专区改称舟山地区。文化大革命时期，舟山地区形势动荡，到1971年4月6日才成立了舟山地区革命委员会。\n1987年1月，经国务院批准，撤销舟山地区和定海、普陀2县，成立舟山市，辖2区（定海区、普陀区）2县（岱山县、嵊泗县），实行以市领导区、县新体制。\n改革开放以后，1986年，国务院、中央军委做出关于舟山港对外开放的批覆（国函〔1986〕54号），沈家门、定海和老塘山三个港区合并为一个港，统称舟山港，舟山港正式对外开放。2006年1月1日开始，宁波港与舟山港合并为宁波舟山港。舟山港航局于2007年实行政企分开，后于成立2010年实行股份制，创立了舟山港务集团有限公司。自2009年起至今，宁波舟山港一直为世界第一大港口。\n2009年底，舟山跨海大桥建成通车，结束了舟山群岛至浙江大陆只能通过轮船运输的历史。同时也极大促进了宁波舟山港的一体化。\n2017年4月，浙江自贸区成立，涵盖舟山离岛片区78.98平方公里，舟山岛北部片区15.62平方公里，舟山岛南部片区25.35平方公里共三个片区119.95平方公里。\n2019年3月，甬舟铁路全面启动勘察设计。铁路规划速度目标值200公里/小时，全长77公里，可运行CRH。该铁路建成后，将结束舟山群岛不通火车的历史，也对于完善宁波铁路枢纽以及宁波港运输通道具有重要意义。主跨1488米的西堠门特大桥，将成为世界同类项目中跨度最大的公铁合建大桥。\n## 地理\n###气候\n舟山气候夏季高温冬季温和，四季分明，海洋性较强，季风显著，属于副热带季风气候。主要气象灾害有夏秋季节的台风（平均每年3～4个，其中1个严重影响）、6～7月的梅雨暴雨和春季干旱等。\n与浙江省大陆地区相比，舟山气候有著显著的海洋性。首先是换季日期都比同纬度的浙江大陆城市（如杭州）偏晚。然后是最热月平均高温比省城杭州低2℃以上，高温（≥35℃）日数偏少20天以上，是良好的避暑胜地；最冷月平均气温比省城偏高1℃以上，降雪日数则明显偏少，即使在2008年南方雪灾，浙江省大部受重创的情况下也基本未有降雪。随著全球气候变暖，近几十年舟山气温持续上升，高温频率日趋增加，在2013年夏季中国南方热浪中更是录得了42.3℃的极端高温，但通常情况下夏季仍然比内陆凉爽不少。\n空气质量方面，受海洋影响，舟山的空气质量极佳，不仅远远优于浙江省其他地区，在全国也常年稳居地级市前三。但2010年后灰霾日数仍有增多趋势，在2013年中东部严重雾霾事件中也曾一度「爆表」（AQI超过500），不过近几年雾霾又有所缓和。\n### 主要海岛\n舟山市辖境由数以千计的岛屿组成，自北而南为马鞍列岛、嵊泗列岛、崎岖列岛、川湖列岛、浪岗山列岛、火山列岛、七姊八妹列岛、中街山列岛、舟山岛及邻近岛屿和梅散列岛等。\n## 政治\n### 历任领导\n市委书记\n市长\n### 行政区划\n舟山群岛史上曾三度建县，两度被废。三次设县时期，均隶属浙江省大陆的明州（或宁波府）管辖。\n舟山市现辖2个市辖区、2个县。\n2005年舟山市建立渔农村新型社区，在一定程度上行使村民委员会的公共管理和服务功能。\n## 经济\n作为一个群岛城市，舟山自古以来便是「以渔而生，以渔而兴」，在工业化以前，渔业一直是舟山的支柱性产业。在改革开放前，舟山整个经济仍一直是以第一产业为主，产业结构呈现「一、二、三」模式。改革开放以后，二、三产业迅速发展，至1995年前则发展为「三、二、一」模式并持续至今。尽管农业在2018年仅占了10.8%的总产值，却仍然得到了19.6%的财政拨款。同时，「海洋经济」占总经济比重不断上升，至2017年占了总产值的65.1%。\n改革开放以来，随著大量农田被用于城市建设，农业（种植业）占第一产业的比重不断下降，林业、牧业亦如此，渔业则继续上升，至2018年已升至占第一产业总产值的95%。\n## 人口\n### 历史\n根据2010年第六次全国人口普查，全市常住人口为112.1万人，同第五次全国人口普查相比，十年共增加11.98万人，增长11.95%，年平均增长率为1.14%。\n## 交通\n不论是客运还是货运，舟山市均以航运为主（而非公路）。水运在客运中所占的比重逐年上升，并在2014年时超过了公路运输；水运在货运中的比重则是在2009至2011年突然上升，近年又略有下降。2018年，水运占了客运量的53.1%，货运量的72.8%。\n### 海运\n海运是主要的对外交通渠道，有定海、沈家门、高亭、泗礁等客运港口，有班轮通上海、宁波、温州、福州等外埠。由于海运的危险性，舟山附近海域常发生渔船货船沉没事故，甚至酿成重大人员伤亡。\n### 公路\n公路通过车渡联运可以通浙江省内大部分地区。岛上交通四通八达，主要岛屿上有班车。向外有舟山跨海大桥（岑港大桥、响礁门大桥、桃夭门大桥、西堠门大桥、金塘大桥）与大陆连接。329终点。\n### 高速公路\n舟山通过G9211与大陆相连。高速公路的主体部分为舟山跨海大桥，由岑港大桥、响礁门大桥、桃夭门大桥、西堠门大桥和金塘大桥五座大桥组成，于2009年12月25日正式试通车。\n### 航空\n群岛现有民用机场1个，即舟山普陀山机场，位于朱家尖岛。在岱山岛上有军用机场，是国民政府退往台湾前修建。目前舟山正在计划开辟岛际直升飞机业务。\n## 旅游\n舟山市有国家级风景名胜区两个，普陀山风景名胜区(含朱家尖)和嵊泗列岛风景名胜区。两个省级风景名胜区为岱山岛风景区和桃花岛风景区。\n## 教育\n### 大学\n浙江海洋大学是舟山境内唯一总部设在舟山的本科高校，浙江大学海洋学院（浙江大学舟山校区）亦在舟山境内，另有浙江国际海运职业技术学院，主要培养高职高专类海运人才。\n### 高中\n舟山中学 普陀中学 南海实验学校 普陀三中 白泉高中 定海一中 镇鳌中学 舟山二中 东海中学 开元中学 岱山中学 大衢中学 东沙中学 嵊泗中学 六横中学 金塘中学\n### 初中\n南海实验学校 定海二中 定海三中 定海五中 定海六中 岑港中学 普陀二中 白泉中学 南海中学 沈家门一中 朱家尖中学 东海中学 开元中学 虾峙中学 台门中学 峧头中学 大衢中学 东港中学\n### 职业学校\n舟山职业技术学校 沈家门中学 舟山航海学校 凯灵中学 普陀职业教育中心 岱山县职业技术学校 嵊泗县职教中心\n## 宗教\n普陀山是观音菩萨的道场，所以舟山民众信奉佛教的尤多。同时道教也有一定基础，各岛各村神庙林立。民众在佛事活动中，不称自己为“某某乡某某村人”，而称“某某地方某某庙界下弟子”。另外基督教也有一定的传播，尤其是在衢山岛上，基督教有上百年传教历史，该岛不少民众成为基督徒。\n## 友好城市\n舟山共有5个友好城市。"],

留村遗址\n\n留村遗址，是新石器时代仰韶文化遗址，位于安新县城西1.5千米留村北300米处，南距白洋淀新安北堤1.5千米。遗址平面呈长方形，长250米，宽200米，面积5万平方米。地势原略高于四周，被当地群众称为“疙瘩顶”。此遗址发现于50年代，后被列为河北省第一批文物保护单位。遗址保存状况良好。遗址地表散存的文化遗物包括较多的陶片及石器、鹿角、兽骨、蚌壳等。1986年，保定地区文物管理所和安新县文化局对留村遗址进行了首次发掘。从文化层堆积和出土的文化遗物来看，第一层为上文化层，出土了大量陶片，器形有折沿罐、敛口罐、红顶碗、壶、盘、钵、陶匕、陶支脚及鼎足等。第二层为下文化层，出土陶片数量少于上层，主要器形与上层基本相同，出土有陶罐、盆、釜、石磨盘、石磨棒、支架等。从发掘资料分析，留村遗址为一处仰韶文化晚期遗址，并含有龙山文化的成分。\n1982年，留村遗址被列为河北省文物保护单位。\n\n### 非遗\n\n* 圈头音乐会\n\n圈头音乐会始创于明末清初，其乐谱、乐曲均为僧传，属北方音乐。音乐会的乐器包括笙、管、笛、云锣、鼓、镲、铙、钹、铛子等，其演奏乐曲中保留着明清乃至更早时代的曲目。\n安新县圈头村音乐会所使用的乐器均为E调，全套曲目共有乐曲40首和一套打击乐《坐禅谭》，其中包括小塌曲14首所有乐曲根据节拍可分为散板、导板、节子板、慢流水板和快流水板五种。圈头村音乐会信奉药王扁鹊及邳彤、华佗、孙林、张仲景、孙思邈、刘河间等中国历代十大名医，代表性的乐曲有《柳黄烟》《五四牌》《大走马》等。圈头村音乐会整体上包含着丰富的文化信息，在民俗学、民族音乐学、音乐史等方面具有较高的研究价值。圈头村还是中央音乐学院音乐学系采风基地。\n2008年6月7日，圈头音乐会列入国家非物质遗产名录。\n\n圈头音乐会\n\n*

白洋淀\n\n白洋淀，位于安新县，是国家重点旅游区和开放区。水域面积366平方千米，为华北平原最大的淡水湖。地形地貌是由海而湖，由湖而陆的反复演变而形成的。淀区被39个村落、3700条沟壕、12万亩芦苇分割成大小不等、形状各异的143个淀泊。以盛产大米、鱼虾、菱藕和“安州苇席”著称。每年7月23日举办“中国白洋淀荷花节”。\n白洋淀历史悠久，早在新石器石代，淀区的西部、南部（今安新县的留村、梁庄）就有人类活动生存。春秋、战国时期，淀区分属于燕、赵统辖，以易水长城（今安新县北堤）为界，南葛城（今安州镇）属赵、北浑泥城（今安新镇）归燕，故淀区有“燕南赵北”之说。\n白洋淀上游有九河，下通津门的水乡泽国，史称西淀。到明弘治元年（1488年）之前已淤为平地，地可耕而食，形成九河入淀之势。之后人们看到淀水“汪洋浩淼，势连天际”，故改称白洋淀。\n\n* 孙犁纪念馆\n\n孙犁纪念馆，于2003年7月11日建成，\n位于安新县白洋淀荷花大观园。孙犁创作的《白洋淀纪事》《白洋淀之曲》《荷花淀》等一系列取材于白洋淀，并开创了以孙犁创作风格为代表的“荷花淀”文学流派。2002年7月11日，孙犁逝世后，安新县委、县政府在白洋淀荷花大观园修建孙犁纪念馆。\n\n* 元妃荷园\n\n元妃荷园，建于2001年，占地约1800亩，是金代章宗皇帝的元妃李师儿赏荷的地方，该景点以自然生态游为主题。园内以赏荷为主，当年章宗皇帝特别宠爱李师儿，为了让她在清晨起来梳妆打扮时也能够看到荷花，就在此修建了一座荷园，并在此修建了梳妆台，被后人称之为“妃子妆台”。因此在开发此景点后，便取名元妃荷园。\n\n## 地方特产\n\n安新县有中国国家地理标志产品——白洋淀咸鸭蛋和白洋淀皮蛋。\n养鸭业是河北安新县的传统产业，白洋淀是华北较大的淡水湖泊，水生物繁多，是淀鸭优良的天然饲料场。鸭群生活在浅淀中，主食鱼，虾、虫、螺、蚌和水藻等新鲜食物，产蛋多，鸭蛋个头大。\n白洋淀咸鸭蛋蛋白清晰透明，煮熟后蛋白细嫩洁白，富有弹性，蛋黄含油多，占比大，色泽深红或杏红，口感纯正，咸淡适中。白洋淀皮蛋蛋白呈墨绿色或绿褐色，饴糖状核心明显。\n\n白洋淀咸鸭蛋和白洋淀皮蛋\n\n2011年7月5日，原国家质检总局批准对“白洋淀咸鸭蛋”和“白洋淀皮蛋”实施地理标志产品保护。\n\n##

{"name": "马斯克林群岛", "documents": ["# 马斯克林群岛\n\n马达加斯加的景点\n\n马斯克林群岛位于非洲的马达加斯加岛以东640～800公里的印度洋中。位于南纬19°43′～21°22′，东经55°15′～63°26′。由留尼汪、毛里求斯和罗德里格斯岛组成，属火山岛面积 4486平方公里。1982年人口147.6万（见毛里求斯、留尼汪岛）。## 简介\n\n马斯克林群岛的形成是由于非洲板块在留尼汪热点上滑动所引起的一连串海底火山爆发，但这地区的火山活动已不再活跃。总面积4486平方公里，人口150万。马斯克林群岛的地表，是海底火山喷发形成的几千米厚的玄武岩沉积层。百万年来的海风和海水，从非洲大陆和印度大陆带来了蕨类植物，漂洋过海的原木带来了蜥蜴和蜘蛛，迁徙的候鸟、欧洲的殖民者带来了多样的植物种子，在独特的气候和地理条件下，马斯克林群岛逐渐演变成一个植物的王国。岛上植被随海拔不同带状分布，强烈海风之下，从海边开始，热带稀树干草、热带雨林、荒原地貌一一呈现。\n\n### 发展历史\n\n早在公元10世纪，这个群岛就因为经过它们岸边的阿拉伯商人开始闻名。15世纪开始，马斯克林群岛成为欧洲船队的补给站，葡萄牙人、荷兰人、法国人和英国人对马斯克林群岛进行了几个世纪的争夺。1578年和1652年，荷兰先后占领毛里求斯岛和开普。1643年法国占领留尼汪岛，1715年法国又从荷兰手中夺取毛里求斯岛，将它们合并为一个殖民地。英国于1806年占领开普殖民地，1810年占领马斯克林群岛。根据1815年维也纳会议的决定，留尼汪岛归还法国，而开普和毛里求斯岛则变成英国的殖民地。1992年毛里求斯共和国得到承认，2001年罗德里格斯取得自治权，留尼汪岛仍被看作法国的一个海外省。\n\n### 殖民史\n\n荷兰殖民者建立开普殖民地后，两洋航线过往船只对鲜肉、蔬菜等日益增长的需求，刺激了殖民者的土地扩张，他们占地建立牧场和农场。在土地扩张的过程中，殖民者对开普的两个土著民族科伊人和萨恩人进行了掠夺和杀戮，消灭了这两个民族。但是，他们在继续向东、向北的殖民扩张道路上遇到了班图人的顽强抵抗，被迫放慢了扩张的步伐。而马斯克林群岛的主要岛屿在殖民者占领时尚无固定居民，殖民者在最初的一段时期是以创造生存条件为主要目的。 荷兰殖民者从建立开普殖民地始就引进了奴隶，从此一切体力劳动均由奴隶承担，奴隶数量激增，到18世纪末便超过了殖民者的人数。马斯克林群岛的奴隶制是与殖民地一起建立的。群岛上的甘蔗和咖啡种植园需要大量劳力，大批奴隶从东非、马达加斯加岛、西非和亚洲等地被贩卖到马斯克林群岛。开普和马斯克林群岛成为非洲的两个主要蓄奴区。\n\n## 高压环境\n\n基本简介\n海平面气压场上，南北半球之间的赤道地区常年为一低压带，低压中心在冬季偏向南半球，位于印尼群岛至赤道中太平洋，即赤道辐合带（ITCZ）和南太平洋辐合带（SPCZ）所在的位置。夏季低压中心向北移动至北半球。春、秋季低压中心沿赤道呈近似对称分布。\n南半球的副热带地区常年为一高压带，冬季共有三个主要的高压中心，分别位于三大洋上，即东南太平洋副高、南大西洋副高和南印度洋副高（马斯克林高压）。在春季，除马高强度略增强外，其它两个高压强度均有不同程度的减弱。夏季，马高强度继续增强并向西延伸与南大西洋高压合并形成南半球冬季（北半球夏季）最强大的高压中心，此时澳大利亚上空也出现一个闭合的高压中心，东南太平洋高压强度比春季有所增强。秋季，马高向东撤退，澳高也消退。\n在副热带高压带以南的高纬度地区，无论冬夏，等压线几乎与纬圈平行，气压随纬度增加迅速降低，低压中心约在65S，这一环绕南极大陆的低压带称作绕极低压带（circumpolar low，CPL）。\n南半球热带外大气环流监测指标\n南半球极涡：用南极区（65S以南）面积加权平均的位势高度值表示。南极涛动：用于表征南半球热带外大气环流的第一模态（中纬度和高纬度之间气压或位势高度场的反位相），原始图片源自CPC。南半球副热带高压带：沿30S纬圈的SLP剖面。南半球绕极低压带：沿65S纬圈的SLP剖面。马斯克林高压指数：（35－25S，40－90E）的SLP面积加权平均的SLP。澳大利亚高压指数：（35－25S，120－150E）面积加权平均的SLP。\n低层越赤道气流监测指标\n索马里越赤道气流：（

构成\n\n火山岛留尼汪\n南印度洋的世外桃源——马斯克林群岛\n留尼汪岛面积2512平方公里，是马斯克林群岛中面积最大的。留尼汪岛上的山脉由三个环谷组成，占到全岛面积的47%。每年这里要接待45万游客。1505年葡萄牙人佩德鲁·德·马斯卡雷尼亚斯登上留尼汪岛，群岛就以他的名字命名。1793年这个岛更名留尼汪，意为“重新联合”。1946年留尼汪岛取得法兰西共和国海外省的地位。\n留尼汪岛上有种类丰富的植物，兰花、天竺葵、棕榈，以及高大的开着鲜艳花朵的仙人掌等等。有一种从墨西哥引进的名为香子兰的娇嫩植物也生长在岛上，香子兰必须要墨西哥的长鼻蜜蜂授粉，但这种蜜蜂拒绝在火山上生活，当地的蜜蜂对香子兰又毫无兴趣。后来，一个留尼汪人偶然用手捻了一下香子兰花的花心，它居然结果了，岛上的人这才知道，这种植物是雌雄同体的。从那时起，留尼汪人随身带一根长长的针，对香子兰进行人工授粉，而香子兰也成了留尼汪岛的象征。\n留尼汪岛上的生活是甜蜜的，空气中弥漫着各种香料的味道，盛产甘蔗和朗姆酒。朗姆酒是岛上居民最喜爱的饮料。\n留尼汪岛被看作法国的一个海外省，城市里用太阳能发电。这里结合了法国式的舒适和非比寻常的异国情调。\n与地貌温和的毛里求斯相比，留尼汪被认为是探险旅游者的天堂。岛上分布着山脉，有印度洋最高的休眠火山——雪峰，它的最高峰终日云雾缭绕。雪峰三面有环谷。在马发特环谷，为了保护天然地貌，一直没有铺设道路，游客们要去想去的景点，只能乘坐直升飞机或者徒步攀登。\n留尼汪岛的东部地区潮湿多雨，西部则相对干燥。印度洋上的信风从东部吹来，但受到山脊的阻挡，所以西部地区呈现典型的热带稀树干草原的景观。\n富裕的留尼汪人住在岛的西部，这里有岛上最豪华的饭店和最美丽的海滩。留尼汪人的主食是兵豆、米饭、香肠和一种叫菽菽的植物。菽菽是一种蔬菜水果类的东西，它的藤蔓被用来做沙拉，根类似土豆，而浅绿色布满凸起的果实则可作为甜点。\n西拉奥地区的兵豆以具有最精致的外形和最柔和的口感著称。这里每年都要庆祝兵豆节，选出“兵豆小姐”。我恰好在兵豆节期间来到西拉奥。在市场上，装满花生的篮子上赫然写着“黄连”。我问货主，他有些羞涩地回答：“是啊，是啊，我知道那不是黄连，但我们这里就是把花生叫做黄连。”后来我了解到，在留尼汪，香蕉被叫做无花果，而印度洋被叫做海。或许对留尼汪人事实就是如此，留尼汪距毛里求斯有200公里，距马达加斯加600多公里，而世界的其他地方，对留尼汪人来说，不啻是另一个星系。\n甜蜜的毛里求斯\n马埃堡是一个绿阴掩映的城市，民居的院墙上爬满了长长的藤蔓，各色鲜艳的花朵在海风中摇曳生姿。在一片浓绿的背景中，农家的小木屋在视线中时隐时现，令人心旷神怡。\n马埃堡港建于1804年，据说整个城市的建筑方案由拿破仑亲自执笔。至今，高大稠密的树冠间，拿破仑时代风格的别墅洋楼隐约可见。站在宽阔的海湾边，云樯帆影尽入眼帘。\n1810年，在毛里求斯的东南岸，法国和英国的舰队狭路相逢，激烈的战斗就在离港口不远的地方展开。在这场战斗中，一位法国将军和一位英国将军都负了伤。好笑的是，这两人被送到同一所豪华疗养院养伤，而且比邻而居。如今，当年的疗养院已经成为海军历史博物馆。\n毛里求斯可以分为四部分：北部海岸有着众多的豪华旅店和一流的海滨浴场；东部是毛里求斯的行政和文化中心；西岸分布着世界上最美丽的珊瑚礁群，是冲浪者和潜水者的天堂；南边则是毛里求斯异国风情最浓郁的地方。毛里求斯岛四周环绕着世界上最美丽的珊瑚礁群，只有南面有通向大洋的唯一出口。岛上原始森林的面积占岛屿总面积的3%。1510年葡萄牙人发现毛里求斯岛，称其为“天鹅岛”， 1638年荷兰东印度公司成立，开始向岛上贩运黑奴，并开辟甘蔗种植园。1968年毛里求斯获得独立。1992年毛里求斯共和国得到承认。\n当年，荷兰殖民者最先在南岸登岛，他们肆无忌惮地开采岛上的资源，以为它将永不枯竭。如今，南部地区有很大一部分被宣布为自然保护区。马埃堡港口是南部唯一的大城市，其余的都是一些渔村和农庄。\n在蔚蓝色的环礁湖中有一座小岛——白鹭岛，这里是世界自然保护基金会设在毛里求斯的站点之一。科学家们用了20年时间，来恢复岛上的植被景观和那些行将消亡的鸟类和爬行纲动物。在这个26公顷的岛上，可以见到世界上最珍稀的植物和动物种类。可以说，白鹭岛就是当年未被殖民者开采的毛里求斯。但是，当年岛上的美丽白鹭却再也难觅踪影，它们在17世纪已经被殖民者们灭绝了。如今，白鹭岛或许应该改名为玫瑰鸽岛。这种美丽的鸽子有着非比寻常的玫瑰色羽毛，到1970年，玫瑰鸽只剩下两对，动物学家们经过不懈努力，成功地繁殖了鸽群。如今，保护区内已经有300多只玫瑰鸽自由地生活。\n岛屿南部有毛里求斯唯一一片原始生态的雨林，现被划作自然保护区。保护区内有毛里求斯最奇特的自然景观——七色土。它位于密林中一片开阔地上，地内寸草不生，裸露的地面五颜六色，栗色、橙色、玫瑰色、红色、黄色、铅灰色……仿佛雨后的霓虹。这是火山爆发时喷出的岩浆在强烈阳光照射下发生化学变化造成的奇异现象。\n原始之美罗德里格斯\n如果愿意的话，你可以用一天时间游完整个罗德里格斯岛。岛的长度和宽度大致相当，约为18公里。岛上唯一的城市，也是罗德里格斯的首府——马秋林港，位于北部的港湾，居民有一万多。\n整个罗德里格斯只有三辆公共汽车，它们没有编号，岛上居民为它们起了名字——“沸腾”号、“路王”号和“美好”号。\n罗德里格斯是马斯克林群岛中最僻远的一个，距临近的毛里求斯有600公里。罗德里格斯曾是法国、英国的殖民地，在很长一段时间内也曾经是毛里求斯的殖民地，大量木材源源不断地被运往毛里求斯，数以千计的大海龟被贩卖到毛里求斯，当岛上的资源渐渐枯竭后，罗德里格斯就被彻底遗忘了。如今，岛上的居民们种植番薯、玉米，饲养牲畜以维系生活。\n罗德里格斯的未来，在很大程度上取决于有多少人能够欣赏这个岛上那些荒僻海滩的原始荒凉之美。政府号召居民们栽花种草，美化环境。岛屿东部的海滩沙质细腻，这个原先农家牛群的乐园如今被建成了海滨浴场，而南岸，当地政府计划建成自然保护区。渔民们今后再也不能无限制地在环礁湖内捕捞。\n古生物过30年潜心研究，英国学者成功还原了许多马斯克林群岛上已灭绝古生物的样貌和生活特性，这些曾生活在偏远热带岛屿上的生物与古代巨鸟渡渡鸟属于同时代。\n据学者们介绍，在人类1598年首次踏上印度洋上的毛里求斯岛、留尼汪岛和罗德里格斯岛之前，那里都曾是数百种珍稀生物的乐园。但是在随后约150年的时间里，由于人类狩猎和一些其他物种———比如老鼠等被带到岛上，至少约45种鸟、爬虫类动物和哺乳动物永远地消失了。\n在消失的物种中有31种鸟在别处从未发现过，许多鸟像渡渡鸟一样不能飞，而随人类船只跑到这些岛上来的老鼠等动物不仅“霸占”了这些鸟的巢穴，而且还偷吃它们的蛋，致使许多在地面生活的鸟逐渐灭绝。渡渡鸟“近亲”之一的罗德里格斯愚鸠灭绝于1761年；毛里求斯宽喙鹦鹉于1690年左右灭绝；另一种不能飞的鸟——— 毛里求斯红鸡——— 也在1690年左右灭绝，据史料中当时的水手们讲，它很容易被带红色的东西引诱落入猎人的陷阱。\n与此同时，许多爬虫类动物也遭遇了同样悲惨的命运。毛里求斯大蜥蜴约1600年灭绝，主要原因也是因为老鼠吞吃掉它们的蛋，这些老鼠繁殖很快，惊人的数量给这些古生物带来一场浩劫；罗德里格斯巨龟灭绝于1795年，这种龟最重的可达600磅(约270公斤)，最长可达4英尺(约1.2米)，它们的平均寿命为100岁，主要以植物树叶为食。\n学者成功再现群岛上已灭绝古生物。\n\n## 殖民历史\n\n留尼汪和毛里求斯殖民地及其奴隶种植园制度\n留尼汪和毛里求斯是马斯克林群岛中两个最大的岛屿。大约在10世纪前后，阿拉伯航海者首先发现了这片岛屿。16世纪初葡萄牙探险家也曾涉足此地。但是直到16世纪末，这些岛屿仍是无人居住的荒岛，尚未引起重视。\n16世纪末，夺得了世界商业霸权的荷兰在东方的殖民活动加剧，迫切需要在驶向东方漫长的航路中途建立补给站。1598年9月，一支由范瓦尔维克指挥的荷兰船队占领了马斯克林群岛中的一个主要岛屿，把它称作毛里求斯。1638年，荷兰向该岛运去了第一批移民，毛里求斯成为荷兰的一个海外殖民地。开普殖民地建立以后，毛里求斯岛屿的行政事务由开普殖民地总督兼管。但是，由于毛里求斯岛远离大西洋——印度洋的主航道，岛上的鼠害又严重地影响了农作物的生长，殖地民发展速度极为缓慢。直到18世纪初，岛上的移民包括公司的雇员和被流放的囚犯，也从未超过300人①。\n荷兰占领毛里求斯岛以后不久，法国也开始觊觎这片岛屿。17世纪初，法国对东方的贸易额日益增大，为了与其他西方国家竞争，法国试图在绕经好望角的航线附近开辟一块向东方扩张的根据地。最初，法国东方公司曾在马达加斯加建立一个据点，由于马达加斯加人民的激烈反抗，没有坚持多久便被迫放弃。1643年，法国人占领了距毛里求斯岛仅100浬的马斯克林群岛中的另一个大岛，为了庆贺波旁王朝又得到一块肥沃土地，殖民者把该岛命名为波旁岛②。1663年，法国向波旁岛运去了第一批移民，以后岛上的移民不断增加。到了18世纪初，波旁岛已经成为法国向印度洋地区扩张的一个重要基地。\n1710年，荷兰放弃了毛里求斯岛，把主要精力放在开普殖民地的经营上。1715年，法国舰队占领了毛里求斯岛，改称法兰西岛，并把它与波旁岛合并为一个统一的法属殖民地。\n殖民地在建立初期遇到了一系列困难。首先是海盗的侵扰。印度洋上的海盗主要来自安的列斯群岛，17世纪末这些海盗把巢穴搬到了马达加斯加，从此，马斯克林群岛便成为海盗经常“光顾”的地方，岛上的一些居民也暗地里与海盗来往，海盗活动更加猖蹶。18世纪初，马达加斯加人袭击了建立在本岛的海盗巢穴，海盗把巢穴转移到更靠近马斯克林群岛的圣玛丽岛。为了彻底消灭海盗，殖民地政府一方面采取安抚政策，允许那些愿意洗手不干的海盗到马斯克林群岛定居；一方面对那些继续劫掠的海盗给予严厉打击。1724年，殖民地政府捣毁了圣玛丽岛上的海盗巢穴，抓获了海盗头子拉布兹。1730年，拉布兹被处死，猖蹶一时的印度洋海盗活动暂时平静下来。\n殖民地遇到的另一个困难是，最初很长一段时间内没有找到适宜在岛上生长的农作物。在毛里求斯岛，早在荷兰占领时期就曾试种过粮食，但由于经营不善和鼠害成灾，所种粮食颗粒无收，法国占领初期也一筹莫展。波旁岛虽有着肥沃的土地，但也未善加利用。殖民地政府曾多次试图在波旁岛上种植香料，都未获成功。因此，寻找适宜岛上种植的农作物成为殖民地经济发展的关键所在。\n18世纪初，一支满载阿拉伯咖啡的商船队在法兰西岛和波旁岛停靠，补充淡水和食物。咖啡船的到来启发了岛上的居民，殖民地政府也看中了这种收益很高的经济作物，决定在岛上种植咖啡。1715年，第一批咖啡苗从也门运抵波旁岛。由于气候适宜，咖啡种植很快在全岛传播开来。到1730年，波旁岛生产的咖啡已经可以满足全法国的需要。与此同时，咖啡种植也从波旁岛传到了法兰西岛。但由于管理不善，更重要的是由于波旁岛的咖啡产量日增（1730年代每年仅供出口的咖啡就约有100万公斤），加上其他咖啡生产国的竞争，欧洲市场趋于饱和，咖啡行情疲软，因此咖啡种植业没能在法兰西岛发展起来。1735年，拉布尔多内被任命为两岛的全权总督。他在任职期间，鼓励法兰西岛移民种植甘蔗，并在岛上建立了两家制糖厂。经过十余年的努力，法兰西岛生产的蔗糖足够两岛居民和往来船只食用，并可少量出口，种植园经济在两岛最终确立。\n甘蔗和咖啡种植园的兴起，使殖民地进入了稳步发展时期。但是随着经济作物的大量种植，殖民地又面临另一个更严重的问题——缺乏劳动力。殖民地建立以来，两岛的移民虽在不断增加，但岛上的经济发展更快，劳动力严重缺乏。法国与荷兰等一些欧洲国家相似，国内的资本原始积累过程不像英国那样剧烈，未能造成一支破产的农民大军，因此也就没有形成向外移民的大规模浪潮。所以，直到1735年甘蔗种植园出现之前，两岛的白人移民总共不超过1000人。这时的移民主要是法国公司的退职雇员、冒险家和囚犯，真正想来岛上垦殖的移民只占很小的一部分。岛上的体力劳动主要由奴隶承担，奴隶制是与殖民地一同建立的。\n马斯克林群岛上的奴隶主要来自马达加斯加和东非。18世纪20年代以前，贩卖奴隶主要由海盗经营。海盗往往与殖民地官吏相勾结，波旁岛的一个法国总督就曾多次同海盗签订购买奴隶的合同，总督以低廉的价格从海盗手中买下大批奴隶，然后再把他们转卖给他的下属或岛上的移民，转手之间获利甚丰①。马斯克林群岛成为印度洋上一个重要的蓄奴区。\n18世纪30—40年代种植园经济兴起后，马斯克林群岛上的奴隶便由从事修路、建筑、搬运等体力劳动转向种植园劳动。种植园奴隶终日从事繁重的劳动，他们被当作耕作工具——白人移民的牲畜①。奴隶们每天天一亮即要下地劳动，日落后很久才能收工休息。种植咖啡和甘蔗都是集约劳动，对劳动力的需求量很大，奴隶制得以广泛实行。18世纪中期和后期是马斯克林群岛奴隶制盛行时期，岛上的奴隶超过白人移民和自由市民总数的八九倍之多。\n奴隶的数量随着种植园经济的发展而增长。1735年法兰西岛尚未大规模种植甘蔗以前，包括奴隶在内，全岛的人口不过1000人；30—40年代以后甘蔗种植园兴起，奴隶的数量成倍增长。1766年奴隶人口增长到18100人，到18世纪末已高达49080人。波旁岛也是这样，1708年奴隶的数量还远低于白人移民，到1725年咖啡种植园兴起后，奴隶人口猛增到2000多人，到18世纪末高达44800人。\n随着种植园经济的发展，马斯克林群岛的奴隶买卖活动益趋活跃，范围从马达加斯加和东非扩展到了南亚。18世纪中期，群岛的殖民政府在圣玛丽岛设立了奴隶贩运站，专门向群岛的白人种植园主提供奴隶。据统计，从1670年到1810年，马斯克林群岛大约输入了16万名奴隶。其中，45%是马达加斯加人，40%来自东非，13%是印度人，2%是西非人①。东非的基尔瓦是非洲大陆向马斯克林群岛输出奴隶的主要集中站，1786—1794年平均每年有2500名奴隶运到这里②。18世纪马斯克林群岛的种植园经济处于发展阶段，对奴隶的需求一直呈飞速上升的趋势。18世纪和19世纪之交出现的政治、经济方面的变化更加促进了这种发展。\n1789年，法国爆发了资产阶级革命。1793年，国民公会将波旁岛改名为留尼汪岛。1793年7月，法国政府曾试图禁止马斯克林群岛的奴隶贸易，这项决定遭到群岛种植园主的强烈反对，为此法兰西岛和留尼汪岛曾一度脱离法国实行自治。1800年拿破伦上台，重新恢复对两岛的统治。脱离法国期间，两岛经济有了进一步发展。英法战争期间，两岛又经常派船队劫掠经过的英国船只，短短几年时间获利250万英镑，这笔投资促进了岛上的经济发展。1802年亚眠和约签订后，英法休战，群岛出现了短暂的和平时期，岛上的经济更加繁荣，1802—1803年贸易总额超出了大革命前的两倍。1803年英法战事又起，但由于群岛的产品价格普遍低于欧洲，美国和丹麦等中立国趁机大作转运贸易。据统计，1804年到达法兰西岛的外国船只有50艘，1806年增加到105艘，1807年又增至126艘，两岛的对外贸易额成倍增长。1810年英国先后占领了法兰西岛和留尼汪岛。在英国统治时期，法兰西岛复称毛里求斯，留尼汪岛又改称波旁岛（1848年重称留尼汪岛）。1815年巴黎和约签订后，波旁岛归还法国，毛里求斯则成为英国的殖民地。\n在欧洲形势风云变化时期，群岛上的种植园经济进入极盛时期，奴隶制经济发展到了顶峰。1807年和1817年英法虽先后作出禁止奴隶贸易的决定，但实际上禁而不绝，对马斯克林群岛的奴隶制度几乎没有任何触动。毛里求斯总督法夸尔还力劝英国政府保护秘密的奴隶贸易，并给予法律上的承认①。在法属波旁岛，甚至连高级官员都参加了贩卖奴隶的活动。由于殖民政府对奴隶贸易的暗中支持，马斯克林群岛的奴隶数额有增无减。1835年毛里求斯废除奴隶制之前，奴隶数量高达65000人，同一时期波旁岛的奴隶人口达71000余人，远远超过了岛上的白人移民和自由民人数的总和②。\n马斯克林群岛的奴隶制经济一直延续到19世纪中期。1835年英国在毛里求斯废除奴隶制，1848年法国也在留尼汪岛废除奴隶制。至此，公开的奴隶制可以说已在两岛消失，而隐蔽和变相的奴隶制依然存在。19世纪初以来，从亚洲运来的契约劳工在种植园中从事的就是奴隶般的劳动。19世纪中叶以前，马斯克林群岛的发展与奴隶制密不可分，其殖民活动和繁荣发展是完全建立在奴隶制经济之上的。",
