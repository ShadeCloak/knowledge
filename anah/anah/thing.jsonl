One example is during World War II, when both the Allied and Axis powers used radio broadcasts to spread propaganda and influence public opinion. The Allies, for example, used the Voice of America to broadcast news and information to countries under Nazi occupation, while the Nazis used their own radio broadcasts to spread anti-Semitic propaganda and to glorify the German military.\n\nAnother example is during the Cold War, when both the United States and the Soviet Union used radio broadcasts to spread propaganda and to influence public opinion in other countries. The US government's Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty broadcasts were aimed at promoting democracy and capitalism in Eastern Europe, while the Soviet Union's Radio Moscow broadcasts were aimed at promoting communism and anti-American sentiment.\n\nIn more recent times, radio has been used by various governments and organizations to spread propaganda and influence public opinion. For example, during the Rwandan genocide in 1994, the radio station Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM) was used to spread anti-Tutsi propaganda and to incite violence against the Tutsi population.

Through its members and activities, it seeks to advance occupational and environmental health by bridging scientific knowledge with socio-political centers that have the responsibility to protect public health.  The organization is named after physician Bernardino Ramazzini (1633-1714), known as “the father of occupational medicine.”\nThe Collegium Ramazzini is governed by an elected executive committee composed of a president, secretary general, treasurer, and six other fellows. Three individuals have served as the academy’s president: the late Irving J. Selikoff, MD (1982- 1992); the late Eula Bingham, PhD (1993-1997); Phillip J. Landrigan, MD, MSc (1998-2021); and Melissa McDiarmid, MD, MPH, DABT (2022 to present). The organizations by-laws allow for 180 active fellows with an unlimited number of emeritus fellows.\n## History\nDr. Cesare Maltoni and Dr. Irving J. Selikoff founded the Collegium Ramazzini in 1982. Their goal was an organization of physicians and researchers with expertise in the present and emerging risks associated with exposures to health hazards in workplaces and the environment. Maltoni’s research on the carcinogenesis of vinyl chloride, benzene, and other chemicals, and Selikoff’s on the health effects of exposure to asbestos, motivated their vision of a precautionary approach to the use of industrial chemicals.\nMaltoni and Selikoff sought input from Morris Greenberg, MD; Myron Mehlman, PhD; and Sheldon Samuels to recommend individuals to be members of the Collegium Ramazzini. Sixty four physicians and scientists from 16 countries composed the inaugural class of fellows. They were Nicholas Ashford, PhD (Cambridge, MA, USA); Emilio Astolfi  (Buenos Aires, Brazil); Maths Berlin (Lund, Sweden); Jean Bignon (Creiteil, France); Patricia Buffler, PhD (Houston, TX, USA); Jorge Chiriboga, MD (San Juan, Puerto Rico); Thomas W. Clarkson (Rochester, NY, USA); Morton Corn, PhD (Baltimore, MD, USA); Massimo Crespi, MD (Rome, Italy); John Finklea, MD (Birmingham, AL, USA); Vito Foa, MD (Milan, Italy); Arthur L. Frank, MD, PhD (Lexington, KY, USA); Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., MD (Bethesda, MD, USA); Luigi Giarelli, MD (Trieste, Italy); Giangiacomo Giordano (Naples, Italy); Bernard Goldstein, MD (Piscataway, NJ, USA); Antonio Grieco, MD, PhD (Milan, Italy); J.S. Harington (Johannesburg, South Africa); Bo Holmberg, PhD (Solna, Sweden); Kaye H. Kilburn, MD (Los Angeles, CA, USA); Marvin Legator, PhD (Galveston, TX, USA); Ruth Lilis, MD (New York City, USA); Andrew Maguire (Washington, DC, USA); Cesare Malton (Bologna, Italy); Renzo Mattiussi (Milan, Italy); Rene Mendes, MD (Washington, DC); Franklin Mirer, PhD (Detroit, MI, USA); Norton Nelson, PhD (New York City, USA); Diogo Pupo Nogueira, MD (Sao Paulo, Brazil); Giuseppe Paladini (Bologna, Italy); Edward P.

Upton, MD (New York, USA); Enrico Vigliani (Milan, Italy); Ian Webster, MB, ChB (Johannesburg, South Africa); and Bernard Weinstein, MD (New York, NY, USA).\nSelikoff and Maltoni served as the organization's first president and secretary general, respectively.\nIn 1983, the Collegium held its first meeting of fellows along with an international conference on the health effects of benzene. Speakers included Maltoni, Mehlman, Maths Berlin, MD and Marvin S. Legator, PhD; future fellows Bo Holmberg, PhD (National Board of Occupational Safety and Health, Sweden) and Peter Infante PhD (Occupational Safety and Health Administration, USA); as well as other scientists from academia, governments, and petrochemical companies. Papers from the conference were published in a 1985 edition of the American Journal of Industrial Medicine.\n## Activities\nThe Collegium Ramazzini holds an annual scientific meeting in October that is called “Ramazzini Days.” It is an opportunity for fellows to present new research and discuss emerging issues in the context of the current socio-political environment. The meeting, which is open to the public, is held in the Castello dei Pio in the city of Carpi, Italy, which is the hometown of Bernardino Ramazzini. Beginning in 2006, the agendas for the scientific program have been published on-line and abstracts available since 2020.\nThe Collegium Ramazzini publishes policy statements on pressing environmental and occupational health issues. The statements describe the scientific evidence of harm and the need for policy action by nations and the global community. Since 1984, the Collegium has published 28 policy statements addressing topics such as asbestos, endocrine disruptors, COVID-19, and scientific integrity.\n## Awards\nThe Collegium Ramazzini bestows several awards to recognize an individual's achievement and service to advance knowledge and protection of occupational and environmental health. The Ramazzini Award is bestowed to a \"scientists deemed by the Collegium to have made outstanding contributions to furthering the aims of Bernardino Ramazzini in safeguarding public health\".

{"name": "Clerkenwell crime syndicate", "documents": ["# Clerkenwell crime syndicate\nThe Clerkenwell Crime Syndicate, also known as the Adams Family or the A-Team, is a criminal organisation, allegedly one of the most powerful in the United Kingdom. Media reports have credited them with wealth of up to £200 million.\n## Background\nDuring the 1980s Terence \"Terry\" George Adams formed a syndicate with his brothers Thomas \"Tommy\" Sean Adams and Patrick \"Patsy\" Daniel John Adams as its financier and enforcer respectively. The brothers were born to Irish parents, part of a large family of 11 children who grew up in Barnsbury, Islington.\nThe syndicate was based in Clerkenwell while Terry Adams, until his admission of money laundering in 2007, had lived in Barnsbury. The syndicate expanded over years to include other members of the Adams' family and close childhood friends. A number of the brothers' siblings are understood to have no involvement in crime.\nThe gang is allegedly heavily involved in drug trafficking and extortion as well as the hijacking of gold bullion shipments and security fraud. They have been linked to 25 gangland murders of informants and rival criminals. In addition to developing alleged connections to Metropolitan Police officials, they were also stated to have had a British Conservative MP in their pocket at one point.\nThe shooting of the then 68-year-old \"Mad\" Frankie Fraser, a former enforcer for The Richardson Gang, in July 1991 was said to have been ordered by the Adams family — though Fraser said he had been targeted by rogue police. The family is believed to have connections with various criminal organisations, specifically with South American drug cartels.\nThe BBC has asserted that their influence decreased from 2000 onwards. Police officers, speaking off-record to British newspapers, have said that the family has been credited with acts that they simply did not carry out and this could be true given the number of alleged key gang members killed or imprisoned. However the Metropolitan Police took the Adams' alleged crimes sufficiently seriously to consider the need to involve a CPS-lead team of detectives and the Security Service (MI5) in order to crack the Adams mafia-like organised crime cartel.\nTommy Adams was imprisoned for his involvement in money laundering and a drugs plot that was described as not having been sanctioned by his brothers. During an 18-month bugging operation by MI5, Terry Adams was recorded speaking about his brother in very strident terms and suggesting that, in 1998 at least, relations between them were kept to a minimum. It has been stated that they have a criminal fortune of up to £200 million.\nBefore Tommy and Terry Adams were convicted in 1998 and 2007 respectively, the failure of the police to secure convictions against them had led to a belief that they had undermined the justice system to become untouchables. Police, Crown Prosecution Service staff and jurors were said to have been bribed and intimidated leading to not-guilty verdicts against members of the gang that were said to be wrong.\nThe gang's alleged leader, Terry Adams, has been serving a prison sentence since February 2007, and two of his brothers are under surveillance by the Serious Organised Crime Agency and police in Spain, making other criminals reluctant to do business with them. It has been said that Terry Adams faces severe financial difficulties having been ordered, in May 2007, to repay £4.7 million in legal aid and pay prosecution costs of £800,000.\nSean \"Tommy\" Adams gained high-profile public attention during a trial in 2004, when he was described as having attended a meeting in 2002 at the request of the former football international Kenny Dalglish. Dalglish was a major shareholder in Wilmslow-based sports agency Pro Active, a leading sports management firm headed up by local businessman Paul Stretford. Dalglish was reported to have hired Adams during a protracted deal to secure Pro Active's exclusive management rights to Manchester United, and England football, striker Wayne Rooney, in circumstances where another company claimed to represent Rooney.\nIn February 2010 a 38-year-old man, claiming to be Terry Adams' nephew, was convicted in a case known as the jigsaw murder: the trial revealed that the man, Stephen Marshall, had disposed four bodies for the Adamses. He was sentenced to at least 36 years in prison.\nIn 2014, Sean \"Tommy\" Adams and 13 other people believed to be affiliated with the Clerkenwell Crime Syndicate were arrested in a police operation codenamed \"Octopod.\" Designer watches, six shotguns and large sums of money were found in other addresses across the city, with a concentration in north London. The arrests were linked to conspiracy to assault, money laundering, fraud and revenue offences.\nAt the time, in December 2014, of the death of a bankrupt businessman Scot Young, who had been involved in 2013 in a high-profile divorce case, media reports that flagged Young's involvement with Patrick Adams asserted that Tommy Adams and Michael Adams faced no charges after their arrest earlier in 2014.\n## Personnel and members\n### Terry Adams\nTerence George Adams (born 18 October 1954 in London) was described as having more recently \"adopted an almost genteel persona, buying clothes in expensive fabrics and indulging his love of art and antiques\" to appear legitimate.\nHis downfall came with the assistance of MI5 and the Inland Revenue. MI5, in a unique inter-departmental collaboration the first of its kind after the Cold War ended, played a leading part in the electronic war against organised crime—and turned its sights on Adams's international criminal cartel. Police and MI5 set up a secret squad to dismantle the Adams organisation, directed from an anonymous Hertfordshire address inside a secret bunker sited somewhere on the busy Hoddesdon commuter belt into London. Some of the recordings made over a period of 18 months suggested that Adams had retired from front line involvement in crime in 1990.\nPolice sources believe Adams knew he was being monitored and had \"stage managed\" many conversations for the benefit of his defence. He, for example, was allegedly caught on tape, in 1998, telling his adviser Solly Nahome that he did not want to be involved with a particular illegal deal, which would affect his legitimate business. The Inland Revenue was suspicious enough to ask Adams to explain how he had amassed his personal fortune including his £2 million house and his collection of valuable antiques. Adams invented a range of unlikely occupations, including jeweller and public relations executive. Transcripts of the surveillance and investigations into several front companies Adams set up proved he was lying.\nHe was arrested in April 2003 detectives found art and antiques valued at £500,000, £59,000 in cash and jewellery worth more than £40,000 in his home. On 9 March 2007 at a hearing at the Old Bailey, Andrew Mitchell QC summed up the prosecution's case in saying, \"It is suggested that Terry Adams was one of the country’s most feared and revered organised criminals. He comes with a pedigree, as one of a family whose name had a currency all of its own in the underworld. A hallmark of his career was the ability to keep his evidential distance from any of the violence and other crime from which he undoubtedly profited.\" The former Scottish gangster Paul Ferris asserted that none of the brothers is primus inter pares (first among equals or in sole charge).\nOn 18 May 2007 Adams was ordered to pay £4.8 million in legal fees to three law firms who had initially represented him under the UK's free legal aid scheme. He was also required to pay £800,000 in prosecution costs.\nHe admitted a single specimen money-laundering offence on 7 February 2007, and was jailed for seven years; he was released on 24 June 2010, but was recalled to prison in August 2011 for breaching his licence. Also, on 21 May 2007, he was ordered to file reports of his income for the next ten years. Open case files remain untried on Operation Trinity records and rumour still exists that several further prosecutions may eventually come to trial.\nAdams was released from prison on 24 June 2010.\nIn August 2011 he appeared before City of London Magistrates court charged with 8 breaches of his Financial Reporting Order imposed upon him in 2007.\nDistrict Judge Quentin Purdy said he was \"shrewd and calculating\"...You wilfully and, in my judgment, arrogantly sought to frustrate the effect of a financial reporting order, well knowing that a significant confiscation order remains largely unpaid.\"\nIn July 2014 Adams appeared before a High Court judge in London where he claimed that he was penniless and living in a one bedroom apartment. Adams was ordered to pay £650,000 under the Proceeds of Crime Act.\nIn March 2017 Adams lost his appeal against the order to pay £700,000 under the Proceeds of Crime Act. In November 2017 a district judge sitting in Weston-super-Mare ordered Terry Adams to pay the remaining amount within 30 days or return to prison for at least 2.5 years. In December 2017 Adams repaid the entire confiscation order (around £725,000) despite his repeated claims of poverty. He also attempted to gag the press to stop people knowing that he had repaid the confiscation rather than return to jail. A source close to the investigation said that he must have found nearly three-quarters of a million pounds \"down the back of the sofa.\"\nIn February 2019, media reports suggested that Terry Adams and his wife were living in a housing association flat. Later that month Terry Adams paid back an additional £50,000 to Westminster Magistrates Court despite claiming poverty to avoid returning to prison for non payment of court costs.\n### Tommy Adams\nThomas Sean Adams (born in 1958 in London) is allegedly financier for his brothers Terry and Patrick. A married father of four, he still has a home near the family's traditional Islington base, but was understood to be mainly living in Spain before he was jailed in 2017.\nTommy Adams was charged with involvement in the handling of Brink's-MAT gold bullion but in 1985 was cleared of involvement in the laundering of the proceeds during a high-profile Old Bailey trial with co-defendant Kenneth Noye.\nTommy Adams is suspected of establishing connections to other international criminal organisations including numerous Yardie gangs as well as gaining an $80 million credit line from Colombian drug cartels. In 1998, Adams was convicted of masterminding a £8 million hashish smuggling operation into Britain for which he was jailed for seven years. At trial he was also ordered to pay an unprecedented £6 million criminal assets embargo, or face an additional five years' imprisonment on top of his seven-year term. On appeal the criminal assets embargo was later reduced by appeal judges to £1m largely due to the CPS not having sufficient material evidence, bank accounts or traceable assets to locate and verify Adams' criminal wealth. Adams' wife, Androulla, paid his £1m criminal assets embargo in cash just two days before the CPS deadline.\nTommy was further convicted of money laundering and sentenced to 7 years in 2017 after a number of significant cash seizures of criminal money where linked to him. Money from crime in Manchester was collected and sent to Tommy via trusted associates.\n### Patsy Adams\nPatrick Daniel John Adams (born 2 February 1956 in London) gained an early reputation in London's underworld by using high-speed motorcycles in gangland murders and was a suspect in at least 25 organised-crime related deaths over a three-year period. He was sentenced to seven years in prison in the 1970s for an armed robbery.\nAlthough subordinate to Terry Adams, Patrick — sometimes known as Patsy — has participated in individual criminal activities. Most notably he is suspected of the 1991 murder attempt on Frankie Fraser; also, according to one account, he assaulted Fraser's son David Fraser with a knife, cutting off part of his ear during a drug deal. During the late 1990s, he was reported to spend much of his time in Spain. The Independent stated in 2001 that he was “living in exile in Spain in a walled villa bristling with security cameras a few miles south of Torremolinos”. Patrick Adams and his wife were wanted in connection with an attempted murder in Clerkenwell, London on 22 December 2013 and were arrested in Amsterdam on 7 August 2015. Adams admitted shooting Paul Tiernan but he was cleared of attempted murder after the victim refused to cooperate with police because he believed 'loyalty is everything' and said that being called a 'grass' hurt more than being shot. Adams admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent at Woolwich Crown Court and was sentenced to nine years in 2016.\nPolice who searched Adams's flat in the days after the shooting found a handwritten note from Mr Tiernan, 54, which said 'I ain't no f****** grass' and urged his former friend to 'face me'. In an interview in 2020 Paul Tiernan stated that Adams was released from prison earlier in the year.\n## Connections to other gangsters\nThe Adams family have long been connected to the Brink's-Mat robbery and other individuals who helped sell the stolen gold, including Kenneth Noye.", "# Clerkenwell crime syndicate\nThe Clerkenwell Crime Syndicate, also known as the Adams Family or the A-Team, is a criminal organisation, allegedly one of the most powerful in the United Kingdom.

Open case files remain untried on Operation Trinity records and rumour still exists that several further prosecutions may eventually come to trial.\nAdams was released from prison on 24 June 2010.\nIn August 2011 he appeared before City of London Magistrates court charged with 8 breaches of his Financial Reporting Order imposed upon him in 2007.\nDistrict Judge Quentin Purdy said he was \"shrewd and calculating\"...You wilfully and, in my judgment, arrogantly sought to frustrate the effect of a financial reporting order, well knowing that a significant confiscation order remains largely unpaid.\"\nIn July 2014 Adams appeared before a High Court judge in London where he claimed that he was penniless and living in a one bedroom apartment. Adams was ordered to pay £650,000 under the Proceeds of Crime Act.\nIn March 2017 Adams lost his appeal against the order to pay £700,000 under the Proceeds of Crime Act. In November 2017 a district judge sitting in Weston-super-Mare ordered Terry Adams to pay the remaining amount within 30 days or return to prison for at least 2.5 years. In December 2017 Adams repaid the entire confiscation order (around £725,000) despite his repeated claims of poverty. He also attempted to gag the press to stop people knowing that he had repaid the confiscation rather than return to jail. A source close to the investigation said that he must have found nearly three-quarters of a million pounds \"down the back of the sofa.\"\nIn February 2019, media reports suggested that Terry Adams and his wife were living in a housing association flat. Later that month Terry Adams paid back an additional £50,000 to Westminster Magistrates Court despite claiming poverty to avoid returning to prison for non payment of court costs.\n### Tommy Adams\nThomas Sean Adams (born in 1958 in London) is allegedly financier for his brothers Terry and Patrick. A married father of four, he still has a home near the family's traditional Islington base, but was understood to be mainly living in Spain before he was jailed in 2017.\nTommy Adams was charged with involvement in the handling of Brink's-MAT gold bullion but in 1985 was cleared of involvement in the laundering of the proceeds during a high-profile Old Bailey trial with co-defendant Kenneth Noye.\nTommy Adams is suspected of establishing connections to other international criminal organisations including numerous Yardie gangs as well as gaining an $80 million credit line from Colombian drug cartels. In 1998, Adams was convicted of masterminding a £8 million hashish smuggling operation into Britain for which he was jailed for seven years. At trial he was also ordered to pay an unprecedented £6 million criminal assets embargo, or face an additional five years' imprisonment on top of his seven-year term. On appeal the criminal assets embargo was later reduced by appeal judges to £1m largely due to the CPS not having sufficient material evidence, bank accounts or traceable assets to locate and verify Adams' criminal wealth. Adams' wife, Androulla, paid his £1m criminal assets embargo in cash just two days before the CPS deadline.\nTommy was further convicted of money laundering and sentenced to 7 years in 2017 after a number of significant cash seizures of criminal money where linked to him. Money from crime in Manchester was collected and sent to Tommy via trusted associates.\n## Patsy Adams\nPatrick Daniel John Adams (born 2 February 1956 in London) also called Patsy, is known as the most ruthless member of the Adams family. He dominated criminal activity in Clerkenwell area of London from 1960s until late 1990s, spending over 19 years in prison during the course of his criminal career. Member of the notorious Adams family, he has robbery and firearm related convictions dating back to 1968, when he was aged 12, as well as being sentenced for firearm offense in August 1968, attempted robbery in 1970, and seven armed robberies in 1976 respectively. In 2016 Adams was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment for wounding a police informant during a fight outside his home in Islington.\n### Childhood\nAdams was brought up the Sixties in the Barnsbury area of Islington, North London. He comes from a very poor working class family from Northern Ireland and is one of 11 children. As a child, growing up in poverty he used to steal food from the school buffet and from the market stalls in Islington. His father George Adams worked as a lorry driver in 1960s and later as a mechanic at a Jaguar dealership in North West London. Adams' mother Florence was a housewife who devoted herself to family and to Irish Catholicism. In the Sixties Islington where Adams was brought up was a rough area. In 1964 when Adams was aged 8 he had to started carrying a knife to school for self-defence. Following his first conviction for possession of firearm and ammunition in 1968 when he was just 12, Adams left school and graduated to armed robbery. By 1976, he was involved in seven armed robberies for which he served a seven years in total. Those convictions included stealing a Christmas Turkey from a carvery in Islington on Christmas Day and robbing a festive gift shop on New Year’s Eve.\n### Youth\nAfter his release from prison in 1975, having seven years for armed robbery offences, Adams opened several legitimate businesses. One of these was a divan bed delivery company. In the late 70s he began selling waterbeds when he realised that those started becoming popular in England and by 1976 were in high demand. In 1978, when Adams was 22 years old, he sold his waterbed business and opened one of the first Pinball arcades in London. By 1980s when still in his youth, Adams began to develop reputation as one the most violent figures of London’s underworld. In 1984, at the age of 28 he was again arrested and convicted for possessing firearms and ammunition after he was caught with two guns by police after he was trying to throw them in a river. During his imprisonment he got into fitness, used the gym regularly and developed a good physique. He was feared by inmates in his prison wing after a number of fights. His 1984 conviction for carrying firearms and wearing a full body armour in a public place ended in a 3 year prison sentence.\n### Relocation to Spain\nIn 1986, still in his 30s, upon his release from prison for possession of firearms and ammunition, Adams abandoned crime and relocated to Spain where he bought several properties and formed a legitimate property business.\nHis last imprisonment in 1984 devastated his wife who begged him to leave crime and move abroad as she did not want him to get dragged into some conspiracy by his friends in London and go to prison again. Adams left crime and went straight for 30 years, until his arrest in 2013.\n### Going on a run\nIn 2013 Police launched a covert operation against Adams after circulating him as wanted in connection with shooting of a police informant in Islington, North London, and fleeing the country.\n### 2015 Interpol arrest and imprisonment\nAdams was arrested in Amsterdam on 7 August 2015 during a complex surveillance operation involving face recognition technology and satellites. He was sentenced to nine years imprisonment having admitted shooting Paul Tiernan with a .45 calibre pistol in December 2013. Adams, together with his wife was charged in October 2015 with attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. The murder charge was dropped after Teirnan refused to cooperate with police.\n## George Adams\nMember of the notorious Adams family and son of Patsy Adams, George Adams has burglary and firearm related convictions dating back to 2010 when he was only 21 years old.\n### Burglary\nIn November 2010, aged 21, George Adams was arrested stealing £2,000 of stock from Zee & Co boutique in Upper Street, Islington. He later admitted a charge of burglary at Blackfriars Crown Court. It was his first criminal offence. Adams cut through metal security bars and forced open a rear window in order to break into the shop. He was handed a six-month sentence suspended for two years and was also given a one-year supervision order and told to pay compensation.\n### Bar fight\nIn October 2015 George Adams, aged 32, was involved in an Upper Street bar fight not far from his house, in which a man was stabbed in the face and two others were slashed in the face with a knife. Adams met a woman at the bar and trying to chat her up, he ordered a dry martini for her and added \"make it shaken, not stirred.\" After having her Martini the woman complained to her male friends who were nearby about receiving unwanted attention from Adams and called him a thug. A fight broke out and friends of Adams attacked her three friends who were later taken to hospital, where they received stitches for their injuries. Adams pled guilty and was given a nine month sentence, suspended for 12 months.\n### Shooting\nIn June 2017 George Adams was involved in a shooting at his flat where Danis Salih who owed him £200,000 was shot and wounded during gunfight.\nDanis Salih, 44, armed with a gun, came to George Adams place in Islington to settle the £200.000 debt but could not pay up. A gunfight between Danis and George ensued and Danis was shot and wounded. Having searched Danis' home the police found 8mm bullets and drugs. Danis was later arrested for possession of ammunition without a firearms certificate and possession of cocaine and other drugs recovered by police from his home. Danis admitted possession of ammunition without a firearms certificate and possession of 27 tablets of Alprazolam, 26.9 grams of cannabis, 3.02 grams of cocaine and 1.83 grams of opium. He was sentenced to nine months on the ammunition and one month concurrent on each of the drugs offences suspended for 21 months.\n## Connections to other gangsters\nThe Adams family have long been connected to the Brink's-Mat robbery and other individuals who helped sell the stolen gold, including Kenneth Noye.\n## In popular couture\nThe Adams family is said to have inspired the Gangs of London (TV series)"], "selected_questions": ["What were the roles of Terry, Tommy, and Patsy Adams within the syndicate?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Terry Adams was the leader and allegedly one of the most feared and revered organised criminals in the United Kingdom.

{"name": "Contagious Diseases Acts", "documents": ["# Contagious Diseases Acts\nThe Contagious Diseases Acts (CD Acts) were originally passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1864 (27 & 28 Vict. c. 85), with alterations and additions made in 1866 (29 & 30 Vict. c. 35) and 1869 (32 & 33 Vict. c. 96). In 1862, a committee had been established to inquire into venereal disease (i.e. sexually transmitted infections) in the armed forces. On the committee's recommendation the first Contagious Diseases Act was passed. The legislation allowed police officers to arrest women suspected of being prostitutes in certain ports and army towns. Since there was no set definition of prostitution within the Act, the question was left to the police officer’s discretion, and women could be arrested even if there was no actual evidence of prostitition. The women were then subjected to compulsory physical examinations for venereal disease. If a woman was declared to be infected, she would be confined in what was known as a lock hospital until she recovered or her sentence was completed. Men suspected of frequenting prostitutes were not subjected to the same treatment of compulsory checks and confinement. The law was initially aimed at working-class women in towns near military bases, due to the concern that sexually transmitted infections were hampering Britain’s forces. The original act only applied to a few selected naval ports and army towns, but by 1869 the acts had been extended to cover eighteen \"subjected districts\".\nBecause military men were often unmarried and homosexuality was criminalized, prostitution was considered by military authorities to be a necessary evil, so long as the spread of venereal disease could be contained. The Act of 1864 stated that women found to be infected could be interned in lock hospitals for up to three months, a period extended to one year with the 1869 Act. These measures were justified by medical and military officials as the most effective means to shield men from venereal disease. However, no provision was made for the physical examination of prostitutes' male clientele, which became one of the many points of contention in a campaign to repeal the Acts.\nAfter 1866, proposals were introduced to extend the acts to the north of England and to the civilian population. It was suggested that this extension would serve to regulate prostitution and stop street disorders caused by it in large cities.\nThe subject of venereal disease, known at the time as \"social disease,\" created significant controversy within Victorian society. The Contagious Diseases Acts themselves affected the lives of thousands of prostitutes and working-class women. They sparked the debate over inequality between men and women, and were an early political issue that led to women organising themselves and actively campaigning for their rights.\nThe inconsistent treatment of genders inherent in the acts was a key part of Josephine Butler's campaigns for their repeal. In one of her public letters, she allowed a prostitute to deliver her own account of her personal encounters with men:\nIt is men, only men, from the first to the last that we have to do with! To please a man I did wrong at first, then I was flung about from man to man. Men police lay hands on us. By men we are examined, handled, doctored. In the hospital it is a man again who makes prayer and reads the Bible for us. We are had up before magistrates who are men, and we never get out of the hands of men till we die!\n## Prostitution in Victorian England\nThe level of prostitution was high in Victorian England. Such that the acts themselves affected a large proportion of the female workforce in Britain. For several reasons prostitution was predominantly a working class profession. For many working-class women their journey into prostitution was one of circumstance. During the nineteenth century the public began to concern itself with particular social problems, an increasing view of the \"ideal woman\" was beginning to emerge and the \"angel of the home\" was becoming a popular stereotype. The underlying expectation of Victorian \"respectability\" and morality, which particularly valued female chastity and modesty, also played a part in raising the standards for the actions of women.This rise of the middle class domestic morality made it increasingly difficult for women to obtain work in certain professions, causing an increase in such areas as needle-trades, shop girls, agricultural gangs, factory work, and domestic servants, all occupations with long hours and little pay. Low earnings, in some cases, meant that women had to resort to prostitution to be able to provide for themselves and their families, particularly in households where the male breadwinner was no longer around. Prostitution was a way to survive for many women stuck in poverty, but Victorian ideals framed it as a sinful and immoral way of life. A study from the late Victorian period showed that more than 90 per cent of prostitutes in Millbank prison were the daughters of \"unskilled and semiskilled workingmen\", more than 50 per cent of whom had been servants, the rest having worked in dead-end jobs such as laundering, charring, and street selling.\nThe nature of the occupation makes it difficult to establish the exact number of prostitutes in operation during the Victorian Period. Judicial reports of the years 1857 to 1869 show that prostitutes were more common in commercial ports and pleasure resorts and less so in hardware towns, cotton and linen manufacturing centres and woollen and worsted centres. The Westminster Review placed the figure between 50,000 and 368,000. This would make prostitution the fourth-largest female occupation. However, the police estimates of known prostitutes portray an entirely different estimate:\nPolice estimates of known prostitutes\nThis table relates only prostitutes known to the police. The unreliability of statistics during the nineteenth century prevents one from knowing if prostitution was increasing or decreasing during this period, but it is clear that Victorians during the 1840s and 1850s thought that prostitution and venereal disease were increasing.\nRegulating prostitution was a key part of the government's efforts to control the high level of venereal disease in its armed forces. By 1864, one out of three sick cases in the army was caused by venereal disease; admissions into hospitals for gonorrhea and syphilis reached 290.7 per 1,000 of total troop strength. Prostitutes found customers within the armed forces, mainly due to servicemen's forced celibacy and the conditions of the barracks the men were forced to endure. The barracks were overcrowded, and had a lack of ventilation and defective sanitation. Very few servicemen were permitted to marry, and even those who were, were not given an allowance to support their wives, which occasionally forced those wives to become prostitutes as well. Since the government wanted to limit the spread of venereal diseases within the armed forces, the initial Acts targeted towns near bases and ports. Police officers were permitted to arrest any woman they suspected of being a prostitute. In certain cases, if a brothel was discovered near a base, a police officer was placed outside as a guard to track how many men were coming in and out, along with arresting the women who were under suspicion of prostitution.\nThe efficacy of the Acts in controlling the spread of venereal disease is questionable. Prior to the Acts, troop numbers were declining rapidly, from 83,386 to 59,758 over the course of 6 years. After a ‘Committee on the Contagious Diseases Acts’ was formed to investigate in 1879, evidence showed that many factors other than venereal disease played a part in this reduction. While certain men were discharged for venereal diseases, others were discharged due to bad character, and there was also a significant reduction in recruitment efforts. Additionally, doctors reported that the only improvement made since the Acts was in the treatment for venereal disease, with little or no impact on its spread.  \n## Conditions in lock hospitals\nIf a woman was declared to be infected she would be confined in what were known as lock hospitals. The lock hospitals or lock wards were designed specifically to treat those infected with a venereal disease since 1746. Conditions in lock hospitals were sometimes inadequate. An 1882 survey estimated that there were only 402 beds for female patients in all the voluntary lock hospitals in Great Britain, and out of this number only 232 were \"funded for use\". Female venereal patients generally had to resort to workhouse infirmaries of there was no availability within a lock hospital.\nDepending on the city, there may have been a lock asylum operating in partnership with the lock hospital. Women would receive treatment in the asylum, which was intended to correct their moral deviance. Women were seen as deviant if they were a prostitutes, and the goal was to cure them of their sexual desires. The increased expectation of Victorian “respectability” made the asylum treatment much more popular among the general population. In a lock asylum, women were “taught appropriate behavior through religious instruction, and a decent working-class profession, so that a process of inclusion in respectable society would be fulfilled after a process of exclusion.” For men, their sexual desires were seen as natural impulses that could not and should not be controlled, so they were not subject to the same asylum treatment.  \n## Opposition and extension\n### Early opposition\nFlorence Nightingale’s opposition to the “Continental system” or state regulation of prostitution probably delayed passage of the legislation by a couple of years. However, the first Contagious Diseases Act was adopted, after scarcely any debate in 1864.\nIn 1862, Nightingale prepared a thorough critique of the regulatory approach in Note on the Supposed Protection Afforded against Venereal Diseases, by recognizing Prostitution and Putting it under Police Regulation. The paper included statistics of hospital admissions for venereal disease for various army units at various stations. It showed that the system of regulation did not result in lower rates of disease. Nevertheless, the legislation proceeded.\nNightingale next recruited journalist Harriet Martineau to write on the subject and provided her with background material. She published The Contagious Diseases Acts, as applied to Garrison Towns and Naval Stations, in 1870. The four articles in the series, printed in the Daily News, and credited to “an Englishwoman” ran on each of the last three days of 1869 and the first day of 1870, the last of which launched “The Ladies’ National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts.” It was co-signed by 124 leading women opponents of the Acts. Josephine Butler, who went on to lead the lengthy campaign for repeal, was the third signatory, after Nightingale and Martineau.\nWhen the first woman to qualify as a doctor in England, Elizabeth Garrett, wrote in favour of the Acts, Nightingale, using the name “Justina,” opposed her, with two articles, in the Pall Mall Gazette in 1870. Nightingale continued to give support behind-the-scenes to the repeal campaign.\n### Extension\nIn 1867, the Association for Promoting the Extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts was established and was just as prominent in publishing pamphlets and articles as the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was. The Association strongly campaigned for the extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts outside of the naval and army towns and for them to be made applicable to the whole of the country, as they believed this was the best way of regulating prostitution. In 1869, the Act was extended across the whole country.\n### Later opposition\nThe Contagious Disease Acts were passed very quickly and quietly through the government and were not reported on much in the press because sexual diseases were thought of as inappropriate for public debate. However, as time went on, the impacts of the laws became more widely known and English citizens began to discover more about the harsh treatments and conditions they mandated.  \nIn 1870, the National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was established. This group initially barred women from its meetings, however, leading to the establishment of the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts by Josephine Butler. These repeal organizations attracted the vigorous support of moralists and feminists but also those more generally concerned with civil liberties, especially since the Acts were perceived as having violated basic human rights. Both groups actively campaigned against the acts and between 1870 and 1885:17,365 petitions against the acts bearing 2,606,429 signatures were presented to the House of Commons, and during the same period, more than 900 meetings were held. The opponents struck a chord with the public consensus on the issues surrounding the Acts including double standards and lack of consent.\nJosephine Butler also published essays and spoke at several meetings to rally others in support of repealing the Contagious Disease Acts. These events included the “Influential Meeting of the Ladies”, “The Ladies’ Appeal and Protest”, the “MS LNA Circular”, and a “A Few Words Addressed to True Hearted Women.” Butler’sspeeches highlighted exactly what impact the Acts had on the lives of working-class women. In one of her speeches, she stated “it was recorded that virtuous women had been taken up, virtuous women had been insulted, wives had been taken up and insulted, and most justly, “a medical rape,\" meaning arrested women were often forced into an examination without their consent. Butler described how police officers could arrest any woman they suspected of prostitution, and had arrested several women who were not infected but still forced into an exam.\nAnother woman who took a lead calling for the repeal of the Acts was Elizabeth Blackwell, a doctor who used education to spread public awareness. As a member of the Moral Reform Union, she urged members to stand against the Acts and was one of the few doctors to speak up in opposition of them. Blackwell also emphasized how women and men were not receiving the same treatment under the law. In many of her speeches at conferences, she condemned the inherent double standard in the Acts and “aimed to take the responsibility of purity gatekeeping out of the hands of the women and shift some of the responsibility onto men as well.”\nSimilar to Florence Nightingale’s approach mentioned above, Dr. Charles Bell Taylor and William Paul Swain released a paper in 1869 on their observations of the Acts, in which they criticized the lack of police investigation or evidence required to bring women into a lock hospital or asylum. They argued that it was incredibly unfair that the treatment was not the same towards men with disease. Furthermore, their results highlighted that the Acts did not decrease the spread of disease at all. Additional discourse from their report states that “the public at large is wholly ignorant of the subject, and a due regard for the public welfare urgently demands that the question shall be generally and exhaustively discussed.”\n## Repeal\nAfter years of protesting, the men and women of the National Association and the Ladies National Association gradually won the battle over the Contagious Diseases Acts, and, in 1886, the Acts were finally repealed. In the years that followed, doctors and researchers discovered that voluntary submission to be treated for sexually transmitted diseases was much more effective than the original compulsion that came with the Acts.\n## Archives\nExtensive archives on the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts are held at the Women's Library at the Library of the London School of Economics.", "# Contagious Diseases Acts\nThe Contagious Diseases Acts (CD Acts) were originally passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1864 (27 & 28 Vict. c. 85), with alterations and editions made in 1866 (29 & 30 Vict. c. 35) and 1869 (32 & 33 Vict. c. 96).

By 1864, one out of three sick cases in the army was caused by venereal disease; admissions into hospitals for gonorrhoea and syphilis reached 290.7 per 1,000 of total troop strength.\nProstitutes found work within the armed forces, mainly due to servicemen's forced celibacy and the conditions of the barracks the men were forced to endure. The barracks were overcrowded, and had a lack of ventilation and defective sanitation. Very few servicemen were permitted to marry, and even those who were, were not given an allowance to support their wives, which occasionally lured them to become prostitutes as well.\n## Extension and repeal\nIn 1867, the Association for Promoting the Extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts was established and was just as prominent in the publishing of pamphlets and articles as the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was. The Association strongly campaigned for the extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts to be extended outside of the naval and army barracks and be made effective to the whole of the country, as they believed this was the best way of regulating prostitution.\n### Opposition\nThere was much action taken towards the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. In 1869, the National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was established; initially restricting women from its meetings, causing the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts to be quickly established by Josephine Butler. These repeal organisations attracted the vigorous support of moralists and feminists but also those more generally concerned with civil liberties, especially since the Acts were perceived as having violated basic human rights. Both groups actively campaigned against the acts and between 1870 and 1885, 17,365 petitions against the acts bearing 2,606,429 signatures were presented to the House of Commons, and during the same period, more than 900 meetings were held. The repealists struck a chord with the public consensus on the issues surrounding prostitution and they highlighted the issue of double standards.\nIt was the men and women of the National Association and the Ladies National Association who won the battle over the Contagious Diseases Acts, and, in 1886, the Acts were repealed.\n## Conditions in lock hospitals\nIf a woman was declared diseased she would be confined in what were known as lock hospitals. The lock hospitals or lock wards were designed specifically to treat those infected with a venereal disease since 1746. Conditions in lock hospitals may have been inadequate. An 1882 survey estimated that there were only 402 beds for female patients in all the voluntary lock hospitals in Great Britain, and out of this number only 232 were \"funded for use\". Female venereal patients generally had to resort to workhouse infirmaries.\n## Archives\nExtensive archives on the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts are held at the Women's Library at the Library of the London School of Economics."], "selected_questions": ["Who were the key groups that campaigned against the Contagious Diseases Acts and what were their main concerns?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": [""], "InternLM_answers": ["The Contagious Diseases Acts were campaigned against by several groups, including the National Association for the Promotion of Social Purity, the National Vigilance Association, and the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts.\n\nThe main concerns of these groups were that the Acts legalized prostitution and encouraged the spread of venereal diseases.

Potentials of all other electrodes are compared with that of the standard hydrogen electrode at the same temperature.\n## Nernst equation for SHE\nThe hydrogen electrode is based on the redox half cell corresponding to the reduction of two hydrated protons, 2 H+(aq), into one gaseous hydrogen molecule, H2(g).\nGeneral equation for a reduction reaction:\nThe reaction quotient (Qr) of the half-reaction is the ratio between the chemical activities (a) of the reduced form (the reductant, aRed) and the oxidized form (the oxidant, aOx).\nConsidering the 2 H+/ H2 redox couple:\nat chemical equilibrium, the ratio Qr of the reaction products by the reagents is equal to the equilibrium constant K of the half-reaction:\nWhere, a Red {\\displaystyle a_{\\text{Red}}} and a Ox {\\displaystyle a_{\\text{Ox}}} correspond to the chemical activity of the reduced and oxidized species involved in the redox reaction while a H 2 {\\displaystyle a_{\\mathrm {H_{2}} }} and p H 2 {\\displaystyle p_{\\mathrm {H_{2}} }} respectively denote the chemical activity and the partial pressure of hydrogen (H2) and a H + {\\displaystyle a_{\\mathrm {H^{+}} }} represents the activity of H+. The term p0 is the standard pressure (1 bar = 105 pascal) introduced here simply to overcome the pressure unit and to obtain an equilibrium constant without unit. The hydrogen activity in the gas phase (more commonly named hydrogen fugacity) is thus approximated here by its partial pressure p H 2 {\\displaystyle p_{\\mathrm {H_{2}} }} expressed without unit ( p H 2 = x H 2 ⋅ p {\\displaystyle p_{\\mathrm {H_{2}} }=x_{\\mathrm {H_{2}} }\\cdot p} , with x H 2 {\\displaystyle x_{\\mathrm {H_{2}} }} and p {\\displaystyle p} representing here respectively the H2 mole fraction and the total gas pressure in the system). More details on managing gas fugacity to get rid of pressure unit in thermodynamic calculations can be found at thermodynamic activity#Gases. The followed approach is the same as for chemical activity and molar concentration of solutes in solution. In the SHE, pure hydrogen gas ( x H 2 = 1 {\\displaystyle x_{\\mathrm {H_{2}} }=1} ) at the standard pressure p {\\displaystyle p} of 1 bar is engaged in the system. Meanwhile the general SHE equation can also be applied to other thermodynamic systems with different mole fraction or total pressure of hydrogen.\nThis redox reaction occurs at a platinized platinum electrode. The electrode is dipped in an acidic solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled through it. The concentration of both the reduced form and oxidised form is maintained at unity. That implies that the pressure of hydrogen gas is 1 bar (100 kPa) and the activity coefficient of hydrogen ions in the solution is unity. The activity of hydrogen ions is their effective concentration, which is equal to the formal concentration times the activity coefficient. These unit-less activity coefficients are close to 1.00 for very dilute water solutions, but usually lower for more concentrated solutions.\nAs the general form of the Nernst equation at equilibrium is the following:\nand as E cell ⊖ = 0 {\\displaystyle E_{\\text{cell}}^{\\ominus }=0} by definition in the case of the SHE,\nThe Nernst equation for the SHE becomes:\nSimply neglecting the pressure unit present in p H 2 {\\displaystyle p_{\\mathrm {H_{2}} }} , this last equation can often be directly written as:\nAnd by solving the numerical values for the term − 2.303 R T F = − 2.303 ( 8.314 × 298.15 96 , 485 ) = − 0.0591   v o l t {\\displaystyle -2.303\\,{RT \\over F}=-2.303\\left({\\frac {8.314\\times 298.15}{96,485}}\\right)=-0.0591\\ \\mathrm {volt} } , the practical formula commonly used in the calculations of this Nernst equation is:\nAs under standard conditions p H 2 = 1   b a r {\\displaystyle p_{\\mathrm {H_{2}} }=1\\ \\mathrm {bar} } , log ⁡ p H 2 = l o g   1 = 0 {\\displaystyle \\log p_{\\mathrm {H_{2}} }=log\\ 1=0} , the equation simplifies to:\nThis last equation describes the straight line with a negative slope of -0.0591 volt/ pH unit delimiting the lower stability region of water in a Pourbaix diagram where gaseous hydrogen is evolving because of water decomposition.\nwhere:\naH+ is the activity of the hydrogen ions (H+) in aqueous solution, aH+ = γH+ CH+ / C0, with: γH+ is the activity coefficient of hydrogen ions (H+) in aqueous solution CH+ is the molar concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in aqueous solution C0 is the standard concentration (1 M) used to overcome concentration unit pH2 is the partial pressure of the hydrogen gas, in bar (1 bar = 105 Pa) R is the universal gas constant: 8.3144 J⋅K−1⋅mol−1 (rounded here to 4 decimal) T is the absolute temperature, in kelvin (at 25 °C: 298.15 K) F is the Faraday constant (the charge per mole of electrons), equal to 96,485.3 coulomb·mol−1 p0 is the standard pressure: 1 bar = 105 Pa\nNote: as the system is at chemical equilibrium, hydrogen gas, H2(g), is also in equilibrium with dissolved hydrogen, H2(aq), and the Nernst equation implicitly takes into account the Henry's law for gas dissolution.

{"name": "World Geodetic System", "documents": ["# World Geodetic System\nThe World Geodetic System (WGS) is a standard used in cartography, geodesy, and satellite navigation including GPS. The current version, WGS 84, defines an Earth-centered, Earth-fixed coordinate system and a geodetic datum, and also describes the associated Earth Gravitational Model (EGM) and World Magnetic Model (WMM). The standard is published and maintained by the United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.\n## History\nEfforts to supplement the various national surveying systems began in the 19th century with F.R. Helmert's famous book Mathematische und Physikalische Theorien der Physikalischen Geodäsie (Mathematical and Physical Theories of Physical Geodesy). Austria and Germany founded the Zentralbüro für die Internationale Erdmessung (Central Bureau of International Geodesy), and a series of global ellipsoids of the Earth were derived (e.g., Helmert 1906, Hayford 1910/ 1924).\nA unified geodetic system for the whole world became essential in the 1950s for several reasons:\nInternational space science and the beginning of astronautics. The lack of inter-continental geodetic information. The inability of the large geodetic systems, such as European Datum (ED50), North American Datum (NAD), and Tokyo Datum (TD), to provide a worldwide geo-data basis Need for global maps for navigation, aviation, and geography. Western Cold War preparedness necessitated a standardised, NATO-wide geospatial reference system, in accordance with the NATO Standardisation Agreement\n### WGS 60\nIn the late 1950s, the United States Department of Defense, together with scientists of other institutions and countries, began to develop the needed world system to which geodetic data could be referred and compatibility established between the coordinates of widely separated sites of interest. Efforts of the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force were combined leading to the DoD World Geodetic System 1960 (WGS 60). The term datum as used here refers to a smooth surface somewhat arbitrarily defined as zero elevation, consistent with a set of surveyor's measures of distances between various stations, and differences in elevation, all reduced to a grid of latitudes, longitudes, and elevations. Heritage surveying methods found elevation differences from a local horizontal determined by the spirit level, plumb line, or an equivalent device that depends on the local gravity field (see physical geodesy). As a result, the elevations in the data are referenced to the geoid, a surface that is not readily found using satellite geodesy. The latter observational method is more suitable for global mapping. Therefore, a motivation, and a substantial problem in the WGS and similar work is to patch together data that were not only made separately, for different regions, but to re-reference the elevations to an ellipsoid model rather than to the geoid.\nIn accomplishing WGS 60, a combination of available surface gravity data, astro-geodetic data and results from HIRAN and Canadian SHORAN surveys were used to define a best-fitting ellipsoid and an earth-centered orientation for each of initially selected datum. (Every datum is relatively oriented with respect to different portions of the geoid by the astro-geodetic methods already described.) The sole contribution of satellite data to the development of WGS 60 was a value for the ellipsoid flattening which was obtained from the nodal motion of a satellite.\nPrior to WGS 60, the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force had each developed a world system by using different approaches to the gravimetric datum orientation method. To determine their gravimetric orientation parameters, the Air Force used the mean of the differences between the gravimetric and astro-geodetic deflections and geoid heights (undulations) at specifically selected stations in the areas of the major datums. The Army performed an adjustment to minimize the difference between astro-geodetic and gravimetric geoids. By matching the relative astro-geodetic geoids of the selected datums with an earth-centered gravimetric geoid, the selected datums were reduced to an earth-centered orientation. Since the Army and Air Force systems agreed remarkably well for the NAD, ED and TD areas, they were consolidated and became WGS 60.\n### WGS 66\nImprovements to the global system included the Astrogeoid of Irene Fischer and the astronautic Mercury datum. In January 1966, a World Geodetic System Committee composed of representatives from the United States Army, Navy and Air Force was charged with developing an improved WGS, needed to satisfy mapping, charting and geodetic requirements. Additional surface gravity observations, results from the extension of triangulation and trilateration networks, and large amounts of Doppler and optical satellite data had become available since the development of WGS 60. Using the additional data and improved techniques, WGS 66 was produced which served DoD needs for about five years after its implementation in 1967. The defining parameters of the WGS 66 Ellipsoid were the flattening (1/298.25 determined from satellite data) and the semimajor axis (6378145 m determined from a combination of Doppler satellite and astro-geodetic data). A worldwide 5° × 5° mean free air gravity anomaly field provided the basic data for producing the WGS 66 gravimetric geoid. Also, a geoid referenced to the WGS 66 Ellipsoid was derived from available astrogeodetic data to provide a detailed representation of limited land areas.\n### WGS 72\nAfter an extensive effort over a period of approximately three years, the Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1972 was completed. Selected satellite, surface gravity and astrogeodetic data available through 1972 from both DoD and non-DoD sources were used in a Unified WGS Solution (a large scale least squares adjustment). The results of the adjustment consisted of corrections to initial station coordinates and coefficients of the gravitational field.\nThe largest collection of data ever used for WGS purposes was assembled, processed and applied in the development of WGS 72. Both optical and electronic satellite data were used. The electronic satellite data consisted, in part, of Doppler data provided by the U.S. Navy and cooperating non-DoD satellite tracking stations established in support of the Navy's Navigational Satellite System (NNSS). Doppler data was also available from the numerous sites established by GEOCEIVERS during 1971 and 1972. Doppler data was the primary data source for WGS 72 (see image). Additional electronic satellite data was provided by the SECOR (Sequential Collation of Range) Equatorial Network completed by the U.S. Army in 1970. Optical satellite data from the Worldwide Geometric Satellite Triangulation Program was provided by the BC-4 camera system (see image). Data from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory was also used which included camera (Baker–Nunn) and some laser ranging.\nThe surface gravity field used in the Unified WGS Solution consisted of a set of 410 10° × 10° equal area mean free air gravity anomalies determined solely from terrestrial data. This gravity field includes mean anomaly values compiled directly from observed gravity data wherever the latter was available in sufficient quantity. The value for areas of sparse or no observational data were developed from geophysically compatible gravity approximations using gravity-geophysical correlation techniques. Approximately 45 percent of the 410 mean free air gravity anomaly values were determined directly from observed gravity data.\nThe astrogeodetic data in its basic form consists of deflection of the vertical components referred to the various national geodetic datums. These deflection values were integrated into astrogeodetic geoid charts referred to these national datums. The geoid heights contributed to the Unified WGS Solution by providing additional and more detailed data for land areas. Conventional ground survey data was included in the solution to enforce a consistent adjustment of the coordinates of neighboring observation sites of the BC-4, SECOR, Doppler and Baker–Nunn systems. Also, eight geodimeter long line precise traverses were included for the purpose of controlling the scale of the solution.\nThe Unified WGS Solution, as stated above, was a solution for geodetic positions and associated parameters of the gravitational field based on an optimum combination of available data. The WGS 72 ellipsoid parameters, datum shifts and other associated constants were derived separately. For the unified solution, a normal equation matrix was formed based on each of the mentioned data sets. Then, the individual normal equation matrices were combined and the resultant matrix solved to obtain the positions and the parameters.\nThe value for the semimajor axis (a) of the WGS 72 Ellipsoid is 6378135 m. The adoption of an a-value 10 meters smaller than that for the WGS 66 Ellipsoid was based on several calculations and indicators including a combination of satellite and surface gravity data for position and gravitational field determinations. Sets of satellite derived station coordinates and gravimetric deflection of the vertical and geoid height data were used to determine local-to-geocentric datum shifts, datum rotation parameters, a datum scale parameter and a value for the semimajor axis of the WGS Ellipsoid. Eight solutions were made with the various sets of input data, both from an investigative point of view and also because of the limited number of unknowns which could be solved for in any individual solution due to computer limitations. Selected Doppler satellite tracking and astro-geodetic datum orientation stations were included in the various solutions. Based on these results and other related studies accomplished by the committee, an a-value of 6378135 m and a flattening of 1/298.26 were adopted.\nIn the development of local-to WGS 72 datum shifts, results from different geodetic disciplines were investigated, analyzed and compared. Those shifts adopted were based primarily on a large number of Doppler TRANET and GEOCEIVER station coordinates which were available worldwide. These coordinates had been determined using the Doppler point positioning method.\n### WGS 84\nIn the early 1980s, the need for a new world geodetic system was generally recognized by the geodetic community as well as within the US Department of Defense. WGS 72 no longer provided sufficient data, information, geographic coverage, or product accuracy for all then-current and anticipated applications. The means for producing a new WGS were available in the form of improved data, increased data coverage, new data types and improved techniques. Observations from Doppler, satellite laser ranging and very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) constituted significant new information. An outstanding new source of data had become available from satellite radar altimetry. Also available was an advanced least squares method called collocation that allowed for a consistent combination solution from different types of measurements all relative to the Earth's gravity field, measurements such as the geoid, gravity anomalies, deflections, and dynamic Doppler.\nThe new world geodetic system was called WGS 84. It is the reference system used by the Global Positioning System. It is geocentric and globally consistent within m. Current geodetic realizations of the geocentric reference system family International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) maintained by the IERS are geocentric, and internally consistent, at the few-cm level, while still being metre-level consistent with WGS 84.\nThe WGS 84 reference ellipsoid was based on GRS 80, but it contains a very slight variation in the inverse flattening, as it was derived independently and the result was rounded to a different number of significant digits. This resulted in a tiny difference of 0.105 mm in the semi-minor axis. The following table compares the primary ellipsoid parameters.\n## Definition\nThe coordinate origin of WGS 84 is meant to be located at the Earth's center of mass; the uncertainty is believed to be less than 2 cm.\nThe WGS 84 meridian of zero longitude is the IERS Reference Meridian, 5.3 arc seconds or 102 metres (335 ft) east of the Greenwich meridian at the latitude of the Royal Observatory. (This is related to the fact that the local gravity field at Greenwich doesn't point exactly through the Earth's center of mass, but rather \"misses west\" of the center of mass by about that 102 meters.) The longitude positions on WGS 84 agree with those on the older North American Datum 1927 at roughly 85° longitude west, in the east-central United States.\nThe WGS 84 datum surface is an oblate spheroid with equatorial radius a = 6378137 m at the equator and flattening f = 1/298.257223563. The refined value of the WGS 84 gravitational constant (mass of Earth's atmosphere included) is GM = 3986004.418×108 m3/s2. The angular velocity of the Earth is defined to be ω = 72.92115×10−6 rad/s.\nThis leads to several computed parameters such as the polar semi-minor axis b which equals a × (1 − f) = 6356752.3142 m, and the first eccentricity squared, e2 = 6.69437999014×10−3.\n## Updates and new standards\nThe original standardization document for WGS 84 was Technical Report 8350.2, published in September 1987 by the Defense Mapping Agency (which later became the National Imagery and Mapping Agency). New editions were published in September 1991 and July 1997; the latter edition was amended twice, in January 2000 and June 2004. The standardization document was revised again and published in July 2014 by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency as NGA.STND.0036. These updates provide refined descriptions of the Earth and realizations of the system for higher precision.\nWGS 84 has most recently been updated to use the reference frame G2139, which was released on January 3, 2021. This frame is aligned with the IGb14 realization of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) 2014.\nUpdates to the original geoid for WGS 84 are now published as a separate Earth Gravitational Model (EGM), with improved resolution and accuracy. Likewise, the World Magnetic Model (WMM) is updated separately. The current version of WGS 84 uses EGM2008 and WMM2020.\n## Identifiers\nComponents of WGS 84 are identified by codes in the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset:\nEPSG:4326 – 2D coordinate reference system (CRS) EPSG:4979 – 3D CRS EPSG:4978 – geocentric 3D CRS EPSG:7030 – reference ellipsoid EPSG:6326 – horizontal datum", "# World Geodetic System\nThe World Geodetic System (WGS) is a standard for use in cartography, geodesy, and satellite navigation including GPS. This standard includes the definition of the coordinate system's fundamental and derived constants, the normal gravity Earth Gravitational Model (EGM), a description of the associated World Magnetic Model (WMM), and a current list of local datum transformations.\nThe latest revision is WGS 84 (also known as WGS 1984 ensemble):\nEPSG:4326 for 2D coordinate reference system (CRS), EPSG:4979 for 3D CRS EPSG:4978 for geocentric 3D CRS\nIt is established and maintained by the United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency since 1984, and last revised in January 2021 (G2139 frame realization). WGS 84 ensemble is static, while frame realisations have an epoch. Earlier schemes included WGS 72, WGS 66, and WGS 60. WGS 84 is the reference coordinate system used by the Global Positioning System.\nAs CRS standard, and expressing by URN, urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326, it is composed of:\na standard reference ellipsoid model, named urn:ogc:def:ellipsoid:EPSG::7030; and this ellipsoid is located a standard horizontal datum, named urn:ogc:def:datum:EPSG::6326.\nNot all frame realisations (such as G1762’, 29 January 2017, GPS week 1934) are in EPSG under WGS 84, but under IGS14. G1762’ was the first time IGS14 was used.\nOn 27 November 2022 move to IGS20 is planned.\n## Definition\nThe coordinate origin of WGS 84 is meant to be located at the Earth's center of mass; the uncertainty is believed to be less than 2 cm.\nThe WGS 84 meridian of zero longitude is the IERS Reference Meridian, 5.3 arc seconds or 102 metres (335 ft) east of the Greenwich meridian at the latitude of the Royal Observatory. (This is related to the fact that the local gravity field at Greenwich doesn't point exactly through the Earth's center of mass, but rather \"misses west\" of the center of mass by about that 102 meters.)\nThe WGS 84 datum surface is an oblate spheroid with equatorial radius a = 6378137 m at the equator and flattening f = 1/298.257223563. The refined value of the WGS 84 gravitational constant (mass of Earth's atmosphere included) is GM = 3986004.418×108 m3/s2.

This geoid defines the nominal sea level surface by means of a spherical harmonics series of degree 2160. It is an improvement over the 1996 EGM96 model, which was in turn an improvement over the original WGS 84 geoid, referred to as EGM84. The deviations of the EGM96 geoid from the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid range from about −105 m to about +85 m.\nWGS 84 currently also uses the World Magnetic Model 2020. The next regular update (WMM2025) will occur in December 2024.\n## History\nEfforts to supplement the various national surveying systems began in the 19th century with F.R. Helmert's famous book Mathematische und Physikalische Theorien der Physikalischen Geodäsie (Mathematical and Physical Theories of Physical Geodesy). Austria and Germany founded the Zentralbüro für die Internationale Erdmessung (Central Bureau of International Geodesy), and a series of global ellipsoids of the Earth were derived (e.g., Helmert 1906, Hayford 1910/ 1924).\nA unified geodetic system for the whole world became essential in the 1950s for several reasons:\nInternational space science and the beginning of astronautics. The lack of inter-continental geodetic information. The inability of the large geodetic systems, such as European Datum (ED50), North American Datum (NAD), and Tokyo Datum (TD), to provide a worldwide geo-data basis Need for global maps for navigation, aviation, and geography. Western Cold War preparedness necessitated a standardised, NATO-wide geospatial reference system, in accordance with the NATO Standardisation Agreement\nIn the late 1950s, the United States Department of Defense, together with scientists of other institutions and countries, began to develop the needed world system to which geodetic data could be referred and compatibility established between the coordinates of widely separated sites of interest. Efforts of the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force were combined leading to the DoD World Geodetic System 1960 (WGS 60). The term datum as used here refers to a smooth surface somewhat arbitrarily defined as zero elevation, consistent with a set of surveyor's measures of distances between various stations, and differences in elevation, all reduced to a grid of latitudes, longitudes, and elevations. Heritage surveying methods found elevation differences from a local horizontal determined by the spirit level, plumb line, or an equivalent device that depends on the local gravity field (see physical geodesy). As a result, the elevations in the data are referenced to the geoid, a surface that is not readily found using satellite geodesy. The latter observational method is more suitable for global mapping. Therefore, a motivation, and a substantial problem in the WGS and similar work is to patch together data that were not only made separately, for different regions, but to re-reference the elevations to an ellipsoid model rather than to the geoid.\nIn accomplishing WGS 60, a combination of available surface gravity data, astro-geodetic data and results from HIRAN  and Canadian SHORAN surveys were used to define a best-fitting ellipsoid and an earth-centered orientation for each of initially selected datum. (Every datum is relatively oriented with respect to different portions of the geoid by the astro-geodetic methods already described.) The sole contribution of satellite data to the development of WGS 60 was a value for the ellipsoid flattening which was obtained from the nodal motion of a satellite.\nPrior to WGS 60, the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force had each developed a world system by using different approaches to the gravimetric datum orientation method. To determine their gravimetric orientation parameters, the Air Force used the mean of the differences between the gravimetric and astro-geodetic deflections and geoid heights (undulations) at specifically selected stations in the areas of the major datums. The Army performed an adjustment to minimize the difference between astro-geodetic and gravimetric geoids. By matching the relative astro-geodetic geoids of the selected datums with an earth-centered gravimetric geoid, the selected datums were reduced to an earth-centered orientation. Since the Army and Air Force systems agreed remarkably well for the NAD, ED and TD areas, they were consolidated and became WGS 60.\n## 1966 version\nImprovements to the global system included the Astrogeoid of Irene Fischer and the astronautic Mercury datum. In January 1966, a World Geodetic System Committee composed of representatives from the United States Army, Navy and Air Force was charged with developing an improved WGS, needed to satisfy mapping, charting and geodetic requirements. Additional surface gravity observations, results from the extension of triangulation and trilateration networks, and large amounts of Doppler and optical satellite data had become available since the development of WGS 60. Using the additional data and improved techniques, WGS 66 was produced which served DoD needs for about five years after its implementation in 1967. The defining parameters of the WGS 66 Ellipsoid were the flattening (1/298.25 determined from satellite data) and the semimajor axis (6378145 m determined from a combination of Doppler satellite and astro-geodetic data). A worldwide 5° × 5° mean free air gravity anomaly field provided the basic data for producing the WGS 66 gravimetric geoid. Also, a geoid referenced to the WGS 66 Ellipsoid was derived from available astrogeodetic data to provide a detailed representation of limited land areas.\n## 1972 version\nAfter an extensive effort over a period of approximately three years, the Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1972 was completed. Selected satellite, surface gravity and astrogeodetic data available through 1972 from both DoD and non-DoD sources were used in a Unified WGS Solution (a large scale least squares adjustment). The results of the adjustment consisted of corrections to initial station coordinates and coefficients of the gravitational field.\nThe largest collection of data ever used for WGS purposes was assembled, processed and applied in the development of WGS 72. Both optical and electronic satellite data were used. The electronic satellite data consisted, in part, of Doppler data provided by the U.S. Navy and cooperating non-DoD satellite tracking stations established in support of the Navy's Navigational Satellite System (NNSS). Doppler data was also available from the numerous sites established by GEOCEIVERS during 1971 and 1972. Doppler data was the primary data source for WGS 72 (see image). Additional electronic satellite data was provided by the SECOR (Sequential Collation of Range) Equatorial Network completed by the U.S. Army in 1970. Optical satellite data from the Worldwide Geometric Satellite Triangulation Program was provided by the BC-4 camera system (see image). Data from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory was also used which included camera (Baker–Nunn) and some laser ranging.\nThe surface gravity field used in the Unified WGS Solution consisted of a set of 410 10° × 10° equal area mean free air gravity anomalies determined solely from terrestrial data. This gravity field includes mean anomaly values compiled directly from observed gravity data wherever the latter was available in sufficient quantity. The value for areas of sparse or no observational data were developed from geophysically compatible gravity approximations using gravity-geophysical correlation techniques. Approximately 45 percent of the 410 mean free air gravity anomaly values were determined directly from observed gravity data.\nThe astrogeodetic data in its basic form consists of deflection of the vertical components referred to the various national geodetic datums. These deflection values were integrated into astrogeodetic geoid charts referred to these national datums. The geoid heights contributed to the Unified WGS Solution by providing additional and more detailed data for land areas. Conventional ground survey data was included in the solution to enforce a consistent adjustment of the coordinates of neighboring observation sites of the BC-4, SECOR, Doppler and Baker–Nunn systems. Also, eight geodimeter long line precise traverses were included for the purpose of controlling the scale of the solution.\nThe Unified WGS Solution, as stated above, was a solution for geodetic positions and associated parameters of the gravitational field based on an optimum combination of available data. The WGS 72 ellipsoid parameters, datum shifts and other associated constants were derived separately. For the unified solution, a normal equation matrix was formed based on each of the mentioned data sets. Then, the individual normal equation matrices were combined and the resultant matrix solved to obtain the positions and the parameters.\nThe value for the semimajor axis (a) of the WGS 72 Ellipsoid is 6378135 m. The adoption of an a-value 10 meters smaller than that for the WGS 66 Ellipsoid was based on several calculations and indicators including a combination of satellite and surface gravity data for position and gravitational field determinations. Sets of satellite derived station coordinates and gravimetric deflection of the vertical and geoid height data were used to determine local-to-geocentric datum shifts, datum rotation parameters, a datum scale parameter and a value for the semimajor axis of the WGS Ellipsoid. Eight solutions were made with the various sets of input data, both from an investigative point of view and also because of the limited number of unknowns which could be solved for in any individual solution due to computer limitations. Selected Doppler satellite tracking and astro-geodetic datum orientation stations were included in the various solutions. Based on these results and other related studies accomplished by the committee, an a-value of 6378135 m and a flattening of 1/298.26 were adopted.\nIn the development of local-to WGS 72 datum shifts, results from different geodetic disciplines were investigated, analyzed and compared. Those shifts adopted were based primarily on a large number of Doppler TRANET and GEOCEIVER station coordinates which were available worldwide. These coordinates had been determined using the Doppler point positioning method.\n## 1984 version\nIn the early 1980s, the need for a new world geodetic system was generally recognized by the geodetic community as well as within the US Department of Defense. WGS 72 no longer provided sufficient data, information, geographic coverage, or product accuracy for all then-current and anticipated applications. The means for producing a new WGS were available in the form of improved data, increased data coverage, new data types and improved techniques. GRS 80 parameters together with available Doppler, satellite laser ranging and very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations constituted significant new information. An outstanding new source of data had become available from satellite radar altimetry. Also available was an advanced least squares method called collocation that allowed for a consistent combination solution from different types of measurements all relative to the Earth's gravity field, measurements such as the geoid, gravity anomalies, deflections, and dynamic Doppler.\nThe new world geodetic system was called WGS 84. It is the reference system used by the Global Positioning System. It is geocentric and globally consistent within m. Current geodetic realizations of the geocentric reference system family International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) maintained by the IERS are geocentric, and internally consistent, at the few-cm level, while still being metre-level consistent with WGS 84.\nThe WGS 84 originally used the GRS 80 reference ellipsoid, but has undergone some minor refinements in later editions since its initial publication. Most of these refinements are important for high-precision orbital calculations for satellites but have little practical effect on typical topographical uses. The following table lists the primary ellipsoid parameters.\nThe very small difference in the flattening thus results in a tiny difference of 0.105 mm in the semi-minor axis.\n### Longitudes on WGS 84\nWGS 84 uses the IERS Reference Meridian as defined by the Bureau International de l'Heure, which was defined by compilation of star observations in different countries.\nThe longitude positions on WGS 84 agree with those on the older North American Datum 1927 at roughly 85° longitude west, in the east-central United States.\n## Updates and new standards\nAll components of WGS84 are regularly updated. The Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1984, Its Definition and Relationships With Local Geodetic Systems document, initially published in 1984, has been revised in 1997, in 2004 (as three editions of the TR8350.2), and finally in 2014 as the first edition of NGA.STND.0036. The regularly-updated documents provide refined descriptions of the Earth and realizations of the system for higher precision.\nThe geoid component of WGS84 is being continuously updated as a separate Earth Gravitational Model (EGM).\nThe Earth Gravitational Model 1996 (EGM96) was first published in 1996, with revisions as recent as 2004. The geoid has approximately 100 km resolution versus 200 km for the original WGS 84. The use of EGM96 was confirmed in the 1997 update. Many of the original authors of WGS 84 contributed to a new higher-fidelity model, called EGM2008. This new model has a geoid with accuracy approaching 10 cm, requiring over 4.6 million terms in the spherical expansion (versus 130,317 in EGM96 and 32,757 in WGS 84). The use of EGM2008 was confirmed in the 2014 update. An update was planned for EGM2020.\nThe magnetic model is also being regularly updated as World Magnetic Model (WMM). As stated in the Definition section, the magnetic model is currently World Magnetic Model 2020.\nSolution for Earth orientation parameters consistent with ITRF2014 is also needed (IERS EOP 14C04)."], "selected_questions": ["What parameters define the WGS 84 ellipsoid, and how do they compare to those of GRS 80?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": [""], "InternLM_answers": ["The World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) is an Earth-centered, Earth-fixed coordinate system specified by the World Geodetic System Committee, a part of the International Association of Geodesy (IAG).

Inspired by the events and horrors of the Thirty Years' War which devastated Germany from 1618 to 1648, it is regarded as the first adventure novel in the German language and the first German novel masterpiece.\nThe full subtitle is \"The account of the life of an odd vagrant named Melchior Sternfels von Fuchshaim: namely where and in what manner he came into this world, what he saw, learned, experienced, and endured therein; also why he again left it of his own free will.\"\n## Structure\nThe work Simplicius Simplicissimus consists of five books nominally published 1668, with a sequel Continuatio appearing in 1669. Each book is divided into numerous chapter. The Continuatio is considered the sixth book of the same cycle by scholars, though Grimmelshausen altogether produced ten titles which he claimed belong to the same set.\nThe English translation by Alfred Thomas Scrope Goodrick (1912) included the five books and selected chapters from the continuation. The full translation by Monte Adair (1986–2012) includes the continuation as Book Six.\n## Authorship and publication\nSimplicius Simplicissimus was published as the work of Samuel Greifnsohn vom Hirschfelt (Hirschfeld), with German Schleifheim von Sulsfort as its supposed author, but these have been deduced to be anagrammatical pseudonyms of the real author, Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen, whose name is only disclosed in initials \"H.I.C.V.G.\" in an advertisement (or rather Beschluss, \"postscript\" to the Continuatio) near the end of the published work.\nThe first edition pretends to have been printed at Mompelgart (Mömpelgart, present-day Montbéliard, France) by \"Johann Fillion\", but in fact they were printed in Nürnberg by Wolff Eberhard Felßecker, and though the colophon gave 1669 as the date, the publication already appeared in 1668.\n## Plot overview\nThe novel is told from the perspective of its protagonist Simplicius, a rogue or picaro typical of the picaresque novel, as he traverses the tumultuous world of the Holy Roman Empire during the Thirty Years' War. Raised by a peasant family, he is separated from his home by foraging dragoons and is adopted by a hermit living in the forest, who teaches him to read and introduces him to religion. The hermit also gives Simplicius his name because he was so simple that he did not know what his own name was. After the death of the hermit, Simplicius must fend for himself. He is conscripted at a young age into service, and from there embarks on years of foraging, military triumph, wealth, prostitution, disease, bourgeois domestic life, and travels to Russia, France, and to an alternate world inhabited by mermen. The novel ends with Simplicius turning to a life of hermitage himself, denouncing the world as corrupt.\n## Frontispiece monster\nMuch has been written on the frontispiece copperplate drawing (fig. top right) depicted an enigmatic winged monster holding an illustrated book.\nIt has been described as a composite creature (a chimera) with the features of a goat, fish, bird, human, though \"Satyr-head\" (Satyrkopf, rather thang goat/human) on a Chimera body, may be more apt, since the satyr is a wordplay of the \"satirical\" nature of the work, though the label \"chimera\", has been criticized as strictly incorrect, as it does not match the classical (Homeric) chimera of the lion-goat-serpent variety.\nThe creature is arguably identifiable as the \"phoenix copper\" (German: Phönix-Kupfer), an embodiment of \"the purpose of the book\". There is an accompanying poem about the phoenix copper written in couplets which should provide some clue as to its meaning. The author of a monograph on the subject shuns the identification with the phoenix,\nThe creature has also been interpreted as representing the true author himself (or his narrative work), with the book and the sword serving as mundane objects straightforwardly defining his identity, while the additional parts such as the wings (alluding to air) and the fins and fishtail (water) are allusive hints. This man has enacted many roles (indicated by the masks scattered on the floor), but presently is donning the mask of the \"satirical actor\" in order to perform the task of explaining the world to his audience while pointing-gesturing his book. The creature exists as a whole though made up of odd disparate parts, hence the title copperplate etching is an emblem that serves to preserve the \"unity of the narrative about the I(ego)\".\nThe notion that the frontispiece portrays shapeshifting Baldanders maintained by writer Jorge Luis Borges, is also refuted.\n## Reception and legacy\n### Literary criticism\nThe novel is considered by some to contain autobiographic elements, inspired by Grimmelshausen's experience in the war. It has been reported that as a child Grimmelshausen was kidnapped by Hessian and Croatian troops where he eventually served as a musketeer. The historian Robert Ergang, however, draws upon Gustav Könnecke's Quellen und Forschungen zur Lebensgeschichte Grimmelshausens to assert that \"the events related in the novel Simplicissimus could hardly have been autobiographical since  lived a peaceful existence in quiet towns and villages on the fringe of the Black Forest and that the material he incorporated in his work was not taken from actual experience, but was either borrowed from the past, collected from hearsay, or created by a vivid imagination.\"\n### Adaptions\n#### Literary adaptions\nThe adventures of Simplicissimus became so popular that they were reproduced by authors in other European countries. Simplicissimus was recreated in French, English, and Turkish. A Hungarian Simplicissimus (Ungarischer oder Dacianischer Simplicissimus) was published in 1683. The author remained anonymous but is now generally considered to be Breslau-born Daniel Speer.\n#### Opera\nJohann Strauss II composed an operetta based on the novel.\n20th-century composer Karl Amadeus Hartmann wrote the anti-war opera Simplicius Simplicissimus for chamber orchestra in the mid-1930s, with contributions to the libretto by his teacher Hermann Scherchen. It opens:\nIn A.D. 1618, 12 million lived in Germany. Then came the great war. ... In A.D. 1648 only 4 million still lived in Germany.\nIt was first performed in 1948; Hartmann scored it for full orchestra in 1956.

{"name": "Hei-tiki", "documents": ["hei-tiki\nhei-tiki, small neck pendant in the form of a human fetus, used by the Māori of New Zealand as a fertility symbol. Usually carved of green nephrite or a jadelike stone called pounamu that is found along the western coast of the South Island, hei-tikis normally are worn only by women. The object is believed to possess magical powers that increase as it is passed on from generation to generation. According to one idea, the hei-tiki protects its wearer against the vengeful spirits of stillborn infants, who have been deprived of the chance to live. Another theory holds that the figure represents the Polynesian god Tiki, the creator of life.\nHei-tikis have been prized by European and American collectors for their beauty and elegance, but to the Māori the greatest value of these pendants lies in their possession of magical powers and in the prestige acquired from previous owners.", "# Hei-tiki\nThe hei-tiki (/heɪˈtɪki/) is an ornamental pendant of the Māori of New Zealand. Hei-tiki are usually made of pounamu (greenstone), and are considered a taonga (treasure) by Māori. They are commonly called tiki by New Zealanders, a term that originally refers to large human figures carved in wood and to the small wooden carvings used to mark sacred places. (The word hei in Māori can mean \"to wear around the neck\".)\nRetailers sell tourist versions of hei-tiki throughout New Zealand—these can be made from jade, other types of stone, plastic, or other materials.\n## Origins and materials\nOne theory of the origin of the hei-tiki suggests a connection with Tiki, the first man in Māori legend. According to Horatio Gordon Robley, there are two main ideas behind the symbolism of hei-tiki: they are either memorials to ancestors, or represent the goddess of childbirth, Hineteiwaiwa. The rationale behind the first theory is that they were often buried when their kaitiaki (guardian) died and retrieved later to be placed somewhere special and brought out in times of tangihanga (mourning and associated activities). Because of the connection with Hineteiwaiwa, hei-tiki were often given to a woman by her husband's family if she was having trouble conceiving.\nRobley, author of A History of the Maori Tiki, suggested a similarity of some tiki to images of Buddha, which were often fashioned in green jade. He believed they may have been a forgotten memory of these, in debased form.\nThe most valuable hei-tiki are carved from pounamu which is either nephrite or bowenite (Māori: tangiwai). Pounamu is esteemed highly by Māori for its beauty, toughness and great hardness; it is used not only for ornaments such as hei-tiki and ear pendants, but also for carving tools, adzes and weapons. Named varieties include translucent green kahurangi, whitish inanga, semi-transparent kawakawa, and tangiwai or bowenite.\nA 2014 thesis by Dougal Austin supervised by Peter Adds, based on a survey of the collection of hei-tiki at Te Papa Tongarewa and early-contact examples in foreign collections, found that the mana of hei-tiki is derived from the \"agency of prolonged ancestral use\" and stylistically was \"highly developed ... from the outset to conform to adze-shaped pieces of pounamu.\"\nExamples of hei-tiki are found in museum collections around the world. The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (over 200) and the British Museum (about 50) have two of the largest collections, many of which were exchanged or gifted to European travellers and sailors at the earliest point of contact between the two cultures.\n## Types\nTraditionally there were several types of hei-tiki which varied widely in form. Modern-day hei-tiki, however, may be divided into two types. The first type is rather delicate with a head/body ratio of approximately 30/70 and small details such as ears, elbows and knees. The head is on a tilt, with one hand placed on the thigh, and the other on the chest. The eyes are relatively small. The second type is generally heavier than the first. It has a 40/60 head/body ratio, both hands are on the thighs, and the eyes are proportionately larger.\n## Manufacture\nFrom the size and style of traditional examples of hei-tiki, it is likely that the stone was first cut in the form of a small adze. The tilted head of the pitau variety of hei-tiki derives from the properties of the stone - its hardness and great value make it important to minimize the amount of the stone that has to be removed. Creating a hei-tiki with traditional methods is a long, arduous process during which the stone is smoothed by abrasive rubbing; finally, using sticks and water, it is slowly shaped and the holes bored out. After laborious and lengthy polishing, the completed pendant is suspended by a plaited cord and secured by a loop and toggle.\n## Current popularity\nAmong the other taonga (treasured possessions) used as items of personal adornment are bone carvings in the form of earrings or necklaces. For many Māori the wearing of such items relates to Māori cultural identity. They are also popular with young New Zealanders of all backgrounds for whom the pendants relate to a more generalized sense of New Zealand identity. Several artistic collectives have been established by Māori tribal groups. These collectives have begun creating and exporting jewellery (such as bone carved pendants based on traditional fishhooks hei matau and other greenstone jewellery) and other artistic items (such as wood carvings and textiles). Several actors who have recently appeared in high-profile movies filmed in New Zealand have come back wearing such jewellery, including Viggo Mortensen of The Lord of the Rings fame who took to wearing a hei matau around his neck. These trends have contributed towards a worldwide interest in traditional Māori culture and arts such as Kiri Nathan including pounamu jewellery in her 2013 London Fashion Week exhibition.\nThe Captain of HMS New Zealand, a battle cruiser funded in 1911 by the government of New Zealand for the defence of the British Empire and which took an active part in three battles of the First World War, wore into battle a hei-tiki (as well as a piupiu, Māori warrior's skirt). The crew attributed to this the New Zealand being a \"lucky ship\" which sustained no casualties during the entire war.\n## In popular culture\nThe mockumentary film Hei Tiki was released in 1935, with a NY Times review describing the plot as being about a \"chieftain's daughter who is declared tabu and destined to be the bride of the war god\", attributing the title to mean \"love charm\" (a Hei-tiki pendant interpretation).\nThe crime writer Ngaio Marsh gives prominence to an amuletic hei-tiki (which she calls simply a tiki) in her 1937 novel Vintage Murder.

{"name": "Wehrmacht", "documents": ["# Wehrmacht\nThe Wehrmacht (German pronunciation:  (listen), lit. 'defence force') was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945. It consisted of the Heer (army), the Kriegsmarine (navy) and the Luftwaffe (air force). The designation \"Wehrmacht\" replaced the previously used term Reichswehr and was the manifestation of the Nazi regime's efforts to rearm Germany to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted.\nAfter the Nazi rise to power in 1933, one of Adolf Hitler's most overt and audacious moves was to establish the Wehrmacht, a modern offensively-capable armed force, fulfilling the Nazi régime's long-term goals of regaining lost territory as well as gaining new territory and dominating its neighbours. This required the reinstatement of conscription and massive investment and defense spending on the arms industry.\nThe Wehrmacht formed the heart of Germany's politico-military power. In the early part of the Second World War, the Wehrmacht employed combined arms tactics (close-cover air-support, tanks and infantry) to devastating effect in what became known as Blitzkrieg (lightning war). Its campaigns in France (1940), the Soviet Union (1941) and North Africa (1941/42) are regarded by historians as acts of boldness. At the same time, the far-flung advances strained the Wehrmacht's capacity to the breaking point, culminating in its first major defeat in the Battle of Moscow (1941); by late 1942, Germany was losing the initiative in all theatres. The German operational art proved no match to the war-making abilities of the Allied coalition, making the Wehrmacht's weaknesses in strategy, doctrine and logistics readily apparent.\nClosely cooperating with the SS and the Einsatzgruppen, the German armed forces committed numerous war crimes (despite later denials and promotion of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht). The majority of the war crimes took place in the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece and Italy, as part of the war of annihilation against the Soviet Union, the Holocaust and Nazi security warfare.\nDuring World War II about 18 million men served in the Wehrmacht. By the time the war ended in Europe in May 1945, German forces (consisting of the Heer, the Kriegsmarine, the Luftwaffe, the Waffen-SS, the Volkssturm, and foreign collaborator units) had lost approximately 11,300,000 men, about half of whom were missing or killed during the war. Only a few of the Wehrmacht's upper leadership went on trial for war crimes, despite evidence suggesting that more were involved in illegal actions. According to Ian Kershaw, most of the three million Wehrmacht soldiers who invaded the USSR participated in committing war crimes.\n## Origin\n### Etymology\nThe German term \"Wehrmacht\" stems from the compound word of German: wehren, \"to defend\" and Macht, \"power, force\". It has been used to describe any nation's armed forces; for example, Britische Wehrmacht meaning \"British Armed Forces\". The Frankfurt Constitution of 1849 designated all German military forces as the \"German Wehrmacht\", consisting of the Seemacht (sea force) and the Landmacht (land force). In 1919, the term Wehrmacht also appears in Article 47 of the Weimar Constitution, establishing that: \"The Reich's President holds supreme command of all armed forces  of the Reich\". From 1919, Germany's national defense force was known as the Reichswehr, a name that was dropped in favor of Wehrmacht on 21 May 1935.\n### Background\nIn January 1919, after World War I ended with the signing of the armistice of 11 November 1918, the armed forces were dubbed Friedensheer (peace army). In March 1919, the national assembly passed a law founding a 420,000-strong preliminary army, the Vorläufige Reichswehr. The terms of the Treaty of Versailles were announced in May, and in June, Germany signed the treaty that, among other terms, imposed severe constraints on the size of Germany's armed forces. The army was limited to one hundred thousand men with an additional fifteen thousand in the navy. The fleet was to consist of at most six battleships, six cruisers, and twelve destroyers. Submarines, tanks and heavy artillery were forbidden and the air-force was dissolved. A new post-war military, the Reichswehr, was established on 23 March 1921. General conscription was abolished under another mandate of the Versailles treaty.\nThe Reichswehr was limited to 115,000 men, and thus the armed forces, under the leadership of Hans von Seeckt, retained only the most capable officers. The American historians Alan Millet and Williamson Murray wrote \"In reducing the officers corps, Seeckt chose the new leadership from the best men of the general staff with ruthless disregard for other constituencies, such as war heroes and the nobility.\" Seeckt's determination that the Reichswehr be an elite cadre force that would serve as the nucleus of an expanded military when the chance for restoring conscription came essentially led to the creation of a new army, based upon, but very different from, the army that existed in World War I. In the 1920s, Seeckt and his officers developed new doctrines that emphasized speed, aggression, combined arms and initiative on the part of lower officers to take advantage of momentary opportunities. Though Seeckt retired in 1926, his influence on the army was still apparent when it went to war in 1939.\nGermany was forbidden to have an air force by the Versailles treaty; nonetheless, Seeckt created a clandestine cadre of air force officers in the early 1920s. These officers saw the role of an air force as winning air superiority, strategic bombing, and close air support. That the Luftwaffe did not develop a strategic bombing force in the 1930s was not due to a lack of interest, but because of economic limitations. The leadership of the Navy led by Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, a close protégé of Alfred von Tirpitz, was dedicated to the idea of reviving Tirpitz's High Seas Fleet. Officers who believed in submarine warfare led by Admiral Karl Dönitz were in a minority before 1939.\nBy 1922, Germany had begun covertly circumventing the conditions of the Versailles treaty. A secret collaboration with the Soviet Union began after the Treaty of Rapallo. Major-General Otto Hasse traveled to Moscow in 1923 to further negotiate the terms. Germany helped the Soviet Union with industrialization and Soviet officers were to be trained in Germany. German tank and air-force specialists could exercise in the Soviet Union and German chemical weapons research and manufacture would be carried out there along with other projects. In 1924 a fighter-pilot school was established at Lipetsk, where several hundred German air force personnel received instruction in operational maintenance, navigation, and aerial combat training over the next decade until the Germans finally left in September 1933. However, the arms buildup was done in secrecy, until Hitler came to power and it received broad political support.\n## Nazi rise to power\nAfter the death of President Paul von Hindenburg on 2 August 1934, Adolf Hitler assumed the office of President of Germany, and thus became commander in chief. In February 1934, the Defence Minister Werner von Blomberg, acting on his own initiative, had all of the Jews serving in the Reichswehr given an automatic and immediate dishonorable discharge. Again, on his own initiative Blomberg had the armed forces adopt Nazi symbols into their uniforms in May 1934. In August of the same year, on Blomberg's initiative and that of the Ministeramt chief General Walther von Reichenau, the entire military took the Hitler oath, an oath of personal loyalty to Hitler. Hitler was most surprised at the offer; the popular view that Hitler imposed the oath on the military is false. The oath read: \"I swear by God this sacred oath that to the Leader of the German empire and people, Adolf Hitler, supreme commander of the armed forces, I shall render unconditional obedience and that as a brave soldier I shall at all times be prepared to give my life for this oath\".\nBy 1935, Germany was openly flouting the military restrictions set forth in the Versailles Treaty: German rearmament was announced on 16 March with the \"Edict for the Buildup of the Wehrmacht\" (German: Gesetz für den Aufbau der Wehrmacht) and the reintroduction of conscription. While the size of the standing army was to remain at about the 100,000-man mark decreed by the treaty, a new group of conscripts equal to this size would receive training each year. The conscription law introduced the name \"Wehrmacht\"; the Reichswehr was officially renamed the Wehrmacht on 21 May 1935. Hitler's proclamation of the Wehrmacht's existence included a total of no less than 36 divisions in its original projection, contravening the Treaty of Versailles in grandiose fashion. In December 1935, General Ludwig Beck added 48 tank battalions to the planned rearmament program. Hitler originally set a time frame of 10 years for remilitarization, but soon shortened it to four years. With the remilitarization of the Rhineland and the Anschluss, the German Reich's territory increased significantly, providing a larger population pool for conscription.\n## Personnel and recruitment\nRecruitment for the Wehrmacht was accomplished through voluntary enlistment and conscription, with 1.3 million being drafted and 2.4 million volunteering in the period 1935–1939. The total number of soldiers who served in the Wehrmacht during its existence from 1935 to 1945 is believed to have approached 18.2 million. The German military leadership originally aimed at a homogeneous military, possessing traditional Prussian military values. However, with Hitler's constant wishes to increase the Wehrmacht's size, the Army was forced to accept citizens of lower class and education, decreasing internal cohesion and appointing officers who lacked real-war experience from previous conflicts, especially World War I and the Spanish Civil War.\nThe effectiveness of officer training and recruitment by the Wehrmacht has been identified as a major factor in its early victories as well as its ability to keep the war going as long as it did even as the war turned against Germany.\nAs the Second World War intensified, Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe personnel were increasingly transferred to the army, and \"voluntary\" enlistments in the SS were stepped up as well. Following the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943, fitness and physical health standards for Wehrmacht recruits were drastically lowered, with the regime going so far as to create \"special diet\" battalions for men with severe stomach ailments. Rear-echelon personnel were more often sent to front-line duty wherever possible, especially during the final two years of the war where, inspired by constant propaganda, the oldest and youngest were being recruited and driven by instilled fear and fanaticism to serve on the fronts and, often, to fight to the death, whether judged to be cannon fodder or elite troops.\nPrior to World War II, the Wehrmacht strove to remain a purely ethnic German force; as such, minorities within and outside of Germany, such as the Czechs in annexed Czechoslovakia, were exempted from military service after Hitler's takeover in 1938. Foreign volunteers were generally not accepted in the German armed forces prior to 1941. With the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the government's positions changed. German propagandists wanted to present the war not as a purely German concern, but as a multi-national crusade against the so-called Jewish Bolshevism. Hence, the Wehrmacht and the SS began to seek out recruits from occupied and neutral countries across Europe: the Germanic populations of the Netherlands and Norway were recruited largely into the SS, while \"non-Germanic\" people were recruited into the Wehrmacht. The \"voluntary\" nature of such recruitment was often dubious, especially in the later years of the war when even Poles living in the Polish Corridor were declared \"ethnic Germans\" and drafted.\nAfter Germany's defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad, the Wehrmacht also made substantial use of personnel from the Soviet Union, including the Caucasian Muslim Legion, Turkestan Legion, Crimean Tatars, ethnic Ukrainians and Russians, Cossacks, and others who wished to fight against the Soviet regime or who were otherwise induced to join. Between 15,000 and 20,000 anti-communist White émigrés who had left Russia after the Russian Revolution joined the ranks of the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS, with 1,500 acting as interpreters and more than 10,000 serving in the guard force of the Russian Protective Corps.\n### Women in the Wehrmacht\nIn the beginning, women in Nazi Germany were not involved in the Wehrmacht, as Hitler ideologically opposed conscription for women, stating that Germany would \"not form any section of women grenade throwers or any corps of women elite snipers.\" However, with many men going to the front, women were placed in auxiliary positions within the Wehrmacht, called Wehrmachtshelferinnen (lit. 'Female Wehrmacht Helper'), participating in tasks as:\ntelephone, telegraph and transmission operators, administrative clerks, typists and messengers, operators of listening equipment, in anti-aircraft defense, operating projectors for anti-aircraft defense, employees within meteorology services, and auxiliary civil defense personnel volunteer nurses in military health service, as the German Red Cross or other voluntary organizations.\nThey were placed under the same authority as (Hiwis), auxiliary personnel of the army (German: Behelfspersonal) and they were assigned to duties within the Reich, and to a lesser extent, in the occupied territories, for example in the general government of occupied Poland, in France, and later in Yugoslavia, in Greece and in Romania.\nBy 1945, 500,000 women were serving as Wehrmachtshelferinnen, half of whom were volunteers, while the other half performed obligatory services connected to the war effort (German: Kriegshilfsdienst).\n## Command structure\nLegally, the commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht was Adolf Hitler in his capacity as Germany's head of state, a position he gained after the death of President Paul von Hindenburg in August 1934. With the creation of the Wehrmacht in 1935, Hitler elevated himself to Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, retaining the position until his suicide on 30 April 1945. The title of Commander-in-Chief was given to the Minister of the Reichswehr Werner von Blomberg, who was simultaneously renamed the Reich Minister of War. Following the Blomberg-Fritsch Affair, Blomberg resigned and Hitler abolished the Ministry of War. As a replacement for the ministry, the Wehrmacht High Command Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), under Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, was put in its place.\nPlaced under the OKW were the three branch High Commands: Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH), Oberkommando der Marine (OKM), and Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL). The OKW was intended to serve as a joint command and coordinate all military activities, with Hitler at the top. Though many senior officers, such as von Manstein, had advocated for a real tri-service Joint Command, or appointment of a single Joint Chief of Staff, Hitler refused. Even after the defeat at Stalingrad, Hitler refused, stating that Göring as Reichsmarschall and Hitler's deputy, would not submit to someone else or see himself as an equal to other service commanders. However, a more likely reason was Hitler feared it would break his image of having the \"Midas touch\" concerning military strategy.\nWith the creation of the OKW, Hitler solidified his control over the Wehrmacht. Showing restraint at the beginning of the war, Hitler also became increasingly involved in military operations at every scale.\nAdditionally, there was a clear lack of cohesion between the three High Commands and the OKW, as senior generals were unaware of the needs, capabilities and limitations of the other branches. With Hitler serving as Supreme Commander, branch commands were often forced to fight for influence with Hitler. However, influence with Hitler not only came from rank and merit but also who Hitler perceived as loyal, leading to inter-service rivalry, rather than cohesion between his military advisers.\n## Branches\n### Army\nThe German Army furthered concepts pioneered during World War I, combining ground (Heer) and air force (Luftwaffe) assets into combined arms teams. Coupled with traditional war fighting methods such as encirclements and the \"battle of annihilation\", the Wehrmacht managed many lightning quick victories in the first year of World War II, prompting foreign journalists to create a new word for what they witnessed: Blitzkrieg. Germany's immediate military success on the field at the start of the Second World War coincides the favorable beginning they achieved during the First World War, a fact which some attribute to their superior officer corps.\nThe Heer entered the war with a minority of its formations motorized; infantry remained approximately 90% foot-borne throughout the war, and artillery was primarily horse-drawn. The motorized formations received much attention in the world press in the opening years of the war, and were cited as the reason for the success of the invasions of Poland (September 1939), Denmark and Norway (April 1940), Belgium, France, and Netherlands (May 1940), Yugoslavia and Greece (April 1941) and the early stage of Operation Barbarossa in the Soviet Union (June 1941).\nAfter Hitler declared war on the United States in December 1941, the Axis powers found themselves engaged in campaigns against several major industrial powers while Germany was still in transition to a war economy. German units were then overextended, undersupplied, outmaneuvered, outnumbered and defeated by its enemies in decisive battles during 1941, 1942, and 1943 at the Battle of Moscow, the Siege of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Tunis in North Africa, and the Battle of Kursk.\nThe German Army was managed through mission-based tactics (rather than order-based tactics) which was intended to give commanders greater freedom to act on events and exploit opportunities. In public opinion, the German Army was, and sometimes still is, seen as a high-tech army. However, such modern equipment, while featured much in propaganda, was often only available in relatively small numbers. Only 40% to 60% of all units in the Eastern Front were motorized, baggage trains often relied on horse-drawn trailers due to poor roads and weather conditions in the Soviet Union, and for the same reasons many soldiers marched on foot or used bicycles as bicycle infantry. As the fortunes of war turned against them, the Germans were in constant retreat from 1943 and onward.: 142 \nThe Panzer divisions were vital to the German army's early success. In the strategies of the Blitzkrieg, the Wehrmacht combined the mobility of light tanks with airborne assault to quickly progress through weak enemy lines, enabling the German army to quickly and brutally take over Poland and France. These tanks were used to break through enemy lines, isolating regiments from the main force so that the infantry behind the tanks could quickly kill or capture the enemy troops.\n### Air Force\nOriginally outlawed by the Treaty of Versailles, the Luftwaffe was officially established in 1935, under the leadership of Hermann Göring. First gaining experience in the Spanish Civil War, it was a key element in the early Blitzkrieg campaigns (Poland, France 1940, USSR 1941). The Luftwaffe concentrated production on fighters and (small) tactical bombers, like the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter and the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber. The planes cooperated closely with the ground forces. Overwhelming numbers of fighters assured air-supremacy, and the bombers would attack command- and supply-lines, depots, and other support targets close to the front. The Luftwaffe would also be used to transport paratroopers, as first used during Operation Weserübung. Due to the Army's sway with Hitler, the Luftwaffe was often subordinated to the Army, resulting in it being used as a tactical support role and losing its strategic capabilities.\nThe Western Allies' strategic bombing campaign against German industrial targets, particularly the round the clock Combined Bomber Offensive and Defence of the Reich, deliberately forced the Luftwaffe into a war of attrition. With German fighter force destroyed the Western Allies had air supremacy over the battlefield, denying support to German forces on the ground and using its own fighter-bombers to attack and disrupt. Following the losses in Operation Bodenplatte in 1945, the Luftwaffe was no longer an effective force.\n### Navy\nThe Treaty of Versailles disallowed submarines, while limiting the size of the Reichsmarine to six battleships, six cruisers, and twelve destroyers. Following the creation of the Wehrmacht, the navy was renamed the Kriegsmarine.\nWith the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, Germany was allowed to increase its navy's size to be 35:100 tonnage of the Royal Navy, and allowed for the construction of U-boats. This was partly done to appease Germany, and because Britain believed the Kriegsmarine would not be able to reach the 35% limit until 1942. The navy was also prioritized last in the German rearmament scheme, making it the smallest of the branches.\nIn the Battle of the Atlantic, the initially successful German U-boat fleet arm was eventually defeated due to Allied technological innovations like sonar, radar, and the breaking of the Enigma code.\nLarge surface vessels were few in number due to construction limitations by international treaties prior to 1935. The \"pocket battleships\" Admiral Graf Spee and Admiral Scheer were important as commerce raiders only in the opening year of the war. No aircraft carrier was operational, as German leadership lost interest in the Graf Zeppelin which had been launched in 1938.\nFollowing the loss of the German battleship Bismarck in 1941, with Allied air-superiority threatening the remaining battle-cruisers in French Atlantic harbors, the ships were ordered to make the Channel Dash back to German ports. Operating from fjords along the coast of Norway, which had been occupied since 1940, convoys from North America to the Soviet port of Murmansk could be intercepted though the Tirpitz spent most of her career as fleet in being. After the appointment of Karl Dönitz as Grand Admiral of the Kriegsmarine (in the aftermath of the Battle of the Barents Sea), Germany stopped constructing battleships and cruisers in favor of U-boats. Though by 1941, the navy had already lost a number of its large surface ships, which could not be replenished during the war.\nThe Kriegsmarine's most significant contribution to the German war effort was the deployment of its nearly 1,000 U-boats to strike at Allied convoys. The German naval strategy was to attack the convoys in an attempt to prevent the United States from interfering in Europe and to starve out the British. Karl Doenitz, the U-Boat Chief, began unrestricted submarine warfare which cost the Allies 22,898 men and 1,315 ships. The U-boat war remained costly for the Allies until early spring of 1943 when the Allies began to use countermeasures against U-Boats such as the use of Hunter-Killer groups, airborne radar, torpedoes and mines like the FIDO. The submarine war cost the Kriegsmarine 757 U-boats, with more than 30,000 U-boat crewmen killed.\n### Coexistence with the Waffen-SS\nIn the beginning, there was friction between the SS and the army, as the army feared the SS would attempt to become a legitimate part of the armed forces of Nazi Germany, partly due to the fighting between the limited armaments, and the perceived fanaticism towards Nazism. However, on 17 August 1938, Hitler codified the role of the SS and the army in order to end the feud between the two. The arming of the SS was to be \"procured from the Wehrmacht upon payment\", however \"in peacetime, no organizational connection with the Wehrmacht exists.\" The army was however allowed to check the budget of the SS and inspect the combat readiness of the SS troops. In the event of mobilization, the Waffen-SS field units could be placed under the operational control of the OKW or the OKH. All decisions regarding this would be at Hitler's personal discretion.\nThough there existed conflict between the SS and Wehrmacht, many SS officers were former army officers, which ensured continuity and understanding between the two. Throughout the war, army and SS soldiers worked together in various combat situations, creating bonds between the two groups. Guderian noted that every day the war continued the Army and the SS became closer together. Towards the end of the war, army units would even be placed under the command of the SS, in Italy and the Netherlands. The relationship between the Wehrmacht and the SS improved; however, the Waffen-SS was never considered \"the fourth branch of the Wehrmacht.”\n## Theatres and campaigns\nThe Wehrmacht directed combat operations during World War II (from 1 September 1939 – 8 May 1945) as the German Reich's armed forces umbrella command-organization. After 1941 the OKH became the de facto Eastern Theatre higher-echelon command-organization for the Wehrmacht, excluding Waffen-SS except for operational and tactical combat purposes. The OKW conducted operations in the Western Theatre. The operations by the Kriegsmarine in the North and Mid-Atlantic can also be considered as separate theatres, considering the size of the area of operations and their remoteness from other theatres.\nThe Wehrmacht fought on other fronts, sometimes three simultaneously; redeploying troops from the intensifying theatre in the East to the West after the Normandy landings caused tensions between the General Staffs of both the OKW and the OKH – as Germany lacked sufficient materiel and manpower for a two-front war of such magnitude.\n### Eastern theatre\nMajor campaigns and battles in Eastern and Central Europe included:\nCzechoslovakian campaign (1938–1945) Invasion of Poland (Fall Weiss) Operation Barbarossa (1941), conducted by Army Group North, Army Group Centre, and Army Group South Battle of Moscow (1941) Battles of Rzhev (1942–1943) Battle of Stalingrad (1942–1943) Battle of the Caucasus (1942–1943) Battle of Kursk (Operation Citadel) (1943) Battle of Kiev (1943) Operation Bagration (1944) Nazi security warfare – largely carried out by security divisions of the Wehrmacht, by Order Police and by Waffen-SS units in the occupied territories behind Axis front-lines.\n### Western theatre\nPhoney War (Sitzkrieg, September 1939 to May 1940) between the invasion of Poland and the Battle of France Operation Weserübung German invasion of Denmark – 9 April 1940 The Norwegian Campaign – 9 April to 10 June 1940 Fall Gelb Battle of Belgium 10 to 28 May 1940 German invasion of Luxembourg 10 May 1940 Battle of the Netherlands – 10 to 17 May 1940 Battle of France – 10 May to 25 June 1940 Battle of Britain (1940) Battle of the Atlantic (1939–1945) Battle of Normandy (1944) Allied invasion of southern France (1944) Ardennes Offensive (1944–1945) Defense of the Reich air-campaign, 1939 to 1945\n### Mediterranean theatre\nFor a time, the Axis Mediterranean Theatre and the North African Campaign were conducted as a joint campaign with the Italian Army, and may be considered a separate theatre.\nInvasion of the Balkans and Greece (Operation Marita) (1940–1941) Battle of Crete (1941) The North African Campaign in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt between the UK and Commonwealth (and later, U.S.) forces and the Axis forces The Italian Theatre was a continuation of the Axis defeat in North Africa, and was a campaign for defence of Italy\n## Casualties\nMore than 6,000,000 soldiers were wounded during the conflict, while more than 11,000,000 became prisoners. In all, approximately 5,318,000 soldiers from Germany and other nationalities fighting for the German armed forces—including the Waffen-SS, Volkssturm and foreign collaborationist units—are estimated to have been killed in action, died of wounds, died in custody or gone missing in World War II. Included in this number are 215,000 Soviet citizens conscripted by Germany.\nAccording to Frank Biess,\nGerman casualties took a sudden jump with the defeat of the Sixth Army at Stalingrad in January 1943, when 180,310 soldiers were killed in one month. Among the 5.3 million Wehrmacht casualties during the Second World War, more than 80 per cent died during the last two years of the war. Approximately three-quarters of these losses occurred on the Eastern front (2.7 million) and during the final stages of the war between January and May 1945 (1.2 million).\nJeffrey Herf wrote that:\nWhereas German deaths between 1941 and 1943 on the western front had not exceeded three per cent of the total from all fronts, in 1944 the figure jumped to about 14 per cent. Yet even in the months following D-day, about 68.5 per cent of all German battlefield deaths occurred on the eastern front, as a Soviet blitzkrieg in response devastated the retreating Wehrmacht.\nIn addition to the losses, at the hands of the elements and enemy fighting, at least 20,000 soldiers were executed as sentences by the military court. In comparison, the Red Army executed 135,000, France 102, the US 146 and the UK 40.\n## War crimes\nNazi propaganda had told Wehrmacht soldiers to wipe out what were variously called Jewish Bolshevik subhumans, the Mongol hordes, the Asiatic flood and the red beast. While the principal perpetrators of the civil suppression behind the front lines amongst German armed forces were the Nazi German \"political\" armies (the SS-Totenkopfverbände, the Waffen-SS, and the Einsatzgruppen, which were responsible for mass-murders, primarily by implementation of the so-called Final Solution of the Jewish Question in occupied territories), the traditional armed forces represented by the Wehrmacht committed and ordered war crimes of their own (e.g. the Commissar Order), particularly during the invasion of Poland in 1939 and later in the war against the Soviet Union.\n### Cooperation with the SS\nPrior to the outbreak of war, Hitler informed senior Wehrmacht officers that actions \"which would not be in the taste of German generals\", would take place in occupied areas and ordered them that they \"should not interfere in such matters but restrict themselves to their military duties\". Some Wehrmacht officers initially showed a strong dislike for the SS and objected to the army committing war crimes with the SS, though these objections were not against the idea of the atrocities themselves. Later during the war, relations between the SS and Wehrmacht improved significantly. The common soldier had no qualms with the SS, and often assisted them in rounding up civilians for executions.\nThe Army's Chief of Staff General Franz Halder in a directive declared that in the event of guerrilla attacks, German troops were to impose \"collective measures of force\" by massacring entire villages. Cooperation between the SS Einsatzgruppen and the Wehrmacht involved supplying the death squads with weapons, ammunition, equipment, transport, and even housing. Partisan fighters, Jews, and Communists became synonymous enemies of the Nazi regime and were hunted down and exterminated by the Einsatzgruppen and Wehrmacht alike, something revealed in numerous field journal entries from German soldiers. With the implementation of the Hunger Plan, hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of Soviet civilians were deliberately starved to death, as the Germans seized food for their armies and fodder for their draft horses. According to Thomas Kühne: \"an estimated 300,000–500,000 people were killed during the Wehrmacht's Nazi security warfare in the Soviet Union.\"\nWhile secretly listening to conversations of captured German generals, British officials became aware that the German Army had taken part in the atrocities and mass-murder of Jews and were guilty of war crimes. American officials learned of the Wehrmacht's atrocities in much the same way. Taped conversations of soldiers detained as POWs revealed how some of them voluntarily participated in mass executions.\n### Crimes against civilians\nDuring the war, the Wehrmacht committed numerous war crimes against the civilian population in occupied countries. This includes massacres of civilians and running forced brothels in occupied areas.\nMassacres would in many cases come as reprisals for acts of resistance. With these reprisals, the Wehrmacht's response would vary in severity and method, depending on the scale of resistance and whether it was in East or West Europe. Often, the number of hostages to be shot was calculated based on a ratio of 100 hostages executed for every German soldier killed and 50 hostages executed for every German soldier wounded. Other times civilians would be rounded up and shot with machine guns.\nTo combat German officials' fear of venereal disease and masturbation, the Wehrmacht established numerous brothels throughout Nazi Germany and its occupied territories. Women would often be kidnapped off the streets and forced to work in the brothels, with an estimated minimum of 34,140 women being forced to serve as prostitutes.\n### Crimes against POWs\nWhile the Wehrmacht's prisoner-of-war camps for inmates from the west generally satisfied the humanitarian requirement prescribed by international law, prisoners from Poland and the USSR were incarcerated under significantly worse conditions. Between the launching of Operation Barbarossa in the summer of 1941 and the following spring, 2.8 million of the 3.2 million Soviet prisoners taken died while in German hands.\n### Criminal and genocidal organization\nAmong German historians, the view that the Wehrmacht had participated in wartime atrocities, particularly on the Eastern Front, grew in the late 1970s and the 1980s. In the 1990s, public conception in Germany was influenced by controversial reactions and debates about the exhibition of war crime issues.\nThe Israeli historian Omer Bartov, a leading expert on the Wehrmacht wrote in 2003 that the Wehrmacht was a willing instrument of genocide, and that it is untrue that the Wehrmacht was an apolitical, professional fighting force that had only a few \"bad apples\". Bartov argues that far from being the \"untarnished shield\", as successive German apologists stated after the war, the Wehrmacht was a criminal organization. Likewise, the historian Richard J. Evans, a leading expert on modern German history, wrote that the Wehrmacht was a genocidal organization. The historian Ben H. Shepherd writes that \"There is now clear agreement amongst historians that the German Wehrmacht ... identified strongly with National Socialism and embroiled itself in the criminality of the Third Reich.\" British historian Ian Kershaw concludes that the Wehrmacht's duty was to ensure that the people who met Hitler's requirements of being part of the Aryan Herrenvolk (\"Aryan master race\") had living space. He wrote that:\nThe Nazi revolution was broader than just the Holocaust. Its second goal was to eliminate Slavs from central and eastern Europe and to create a Lebensraum for Aryans. ... As Bartov (The Eastern Front; Hitler's Army) shows, it barbarised the German armies on the eastern front. Most of their three million men, from generals to ordinary soldiers, helped exterminate captured Slav soldiers and civilians. This was sometimes cold and deliberate murder of individuals (as with Jews), sometimes generalised brutality and neglect. ... German soldiers' letters and memoirs reveal their terrible reasoning: Slavs were 'the Asiatic-Bolshevik' horde, an inferior but threatening race.\nSeveral high-ranking Wehrmacht officers, including Hermann Hoth, Georg von Küchler, Georg-Hans Reinhardt, Karl von Roques, Walter Warlimont and others, were convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the High Command Trial given sentences ranging from time served to life.\n## Resistance to the Nazi regime\nOriginally, there was little resistance within the Wehrmacht, as Hitler actively went against the Treaty of Versailles and attempted to recover the army's honor. The first major resistance began in 1938 with the Oster conspiracy, where several members of the military wanted to remove Hitler from power, as they feared a war with Czechoslovakia would ruin Germany. However, following the success of the early campaigns in Poland, Scandinavia and France, belief in Hitler was restored. With the defeat in Stalingrad, trust in Hitler's leadership began to wane. This caused an increase in resistance within the military. The resistance culminated in the 20 July plot (1944), when a group of officers led by Claus von Stauffenberg attempted to assassinate Hitler. The attempt failed, resulting in the execution of 4,980 people and the standard military salute being replaced with the Hitler salute.\nSome members of the Wehrmacht did save Jews and non-Jews from the concentration camps and/or mass murder. Anton Schmid – a sergeant in the army – helped between 250 and 300 Jewish men, women, and children escape from the Vilna Ghetto in Lithuania. He was court-martialed and executed as a consequence. Albert Battel, a reserve officer stationed near the Przemysl ghetto, blocked an SS detachment from entering it. He then evacuated up to 100 Jews and their families to the barracks of the local military command, and placed them under his protection. Wilm Hosenfeld – an army captain in Warsaw – helped, hid, or rescued several Poles, including Jews, in occupied Poland. He helped the Polish-Jewish composer Władysław Szpilman, who was hiding among the city's ruins, by supplying him with food and water.\nAccording to Wolfram Wette, only three Wehrmacht soldiers are known for being executed for rescuing Jews: Anton Schmid, Friedrich Rath and Friedrich Winking.\n## After World War II\nFollowing the unconditional surrender of the Wehrmacht, which went into effect on 8 May 1945, some Wehrmacht units remained active, either independently (e.g. in Norway), or under Allied command as police forces. The last Wehrmacht unit to come under Allied control was an isolated weather station in Svalbard, which formally surrendered to a Norwegian relief ship on 4 September.\nOn 20 September 1945, with Proclamation No. 2 of the Allied Control Council (ACC), \"ll German land, naval and air forces, the S.S., S.A., S.D. and Gestapo, with all their organizations, staffs and institution, including the General Staff, the Officers' corps, the Reserve Corps, military schools, war veterans' organizations, and all other military and quasi-military organizations, together with all clubs and associations which serve to keep alive the military tradition in Germany, shall be completely and finally abolished in accordance with the methods and procedures to be laid down by the Allied Representatives.\" The Wehrmacht was officially dissolved by the ACC Law 34 on 20 August 1946, which proclaimed the OKW, OKH, the Ministry of Aviation and the OKM to be \"disbanded, completely liquidated and declared illegal\".\n### Military operational legacy\nImmediately following the end of the war, many were quick to dismiss the Wehrmacht due to its failures and claim allied superiority. However, historians have since reevaluated the Wehrmacht in terms of fighting power and tactics, giving it a more favorable assessment, with some calling it one of the best in the world,  partly due to its ability to regularly inflict higher losses than it received, while it fought outnumbered and outgunned.\nIsraeli military historian Martin van Creveld, who attempted to examine the military force of the Wehrmacht in a purely military context, concluded: \"The German army was a superb fighting organization. In point of morale, elan, troop cohesion and resilience, it probably had no equal among twentieth century armies.\" German historian Rolf-Dieter Müller comes to the following conclusion: \"In the purely military sense  you can indeed say that the impression of a superior fighting force rightly exists. The proverbial efficiency was even greater than previously thought, because the superiority of the opponent was much higher than at that time German officers suspected. The analysis of Russian archive files finally gives us a clear picture in this regard.\" Strategic thinker and professor Colin S. Gray believed that the Wehrmacht possessed outstanding tactical and operational capabilities. However, following a number of successful campaigns, German policy began to have victory disease, asking the Wehrmacht to do the impossible. The continued use of the Blitzkrieg also led to Soviets learning the tactic and using it against the Wehrmacht.\n### Historical negationism\nSoon after the war ended, former Wehrmacht officers, veterans' groups and various far-right authors began to state that the Wehrmacht was an apolitical organization which was largely innocent of Nazi Germany's war crimes and crimes against humanity. Attempting to benefit from the clean Wehrmacht myth, veterans of the Waffen-SS declared that the organisation had virtually been a branch of the Wehrmacht and therefore had fought as \"honourably\" as it. Its veterans organisation, HIAG, attempted to cultivate a myth of their soldiers having been \"Soldiers like any other\".\n### Post-war militaries\nFollowing the division of Germany, many former Wehrmacht and SS officers in West Germany feared a Soviet invasion of the country. To combat this, several prominent officers created a secret army, unknown to the general public and without mandate from the Allied Control Authority or the West German government.\nBy the mid-1950s, tensions of the Cold War led to the creation of separate military forces in the Federal Republic of Germany and the socialist German Democratic Republic. The West German military, officially created on 5 May 1955, took the name Bundeswehr (lit. 'Federal Defence'). Its East German counterpart—created on 1 March 1956—took the name National People's Army (German: Nationale Volksarmee). Both organizations employed many former Wehrmacht members, particularly in their formative years, though neither organization considered themselves successors to the Wehrmacht. However, according to historian Hannes Heer \"Germans still have a hard time, when it comes to openly dealing with their Nazi past\", as such of the 50 military bases named after Wehrmacht soldiers, only 16 bases have changed names.\nWehrmacht veterans in West Germany have received pensions through the War Victims' Assistance Act (German: Bundesversorgungsgesetz) from the government. According to The Times of Israel, \"The benefits come through the Federal Pension Act, which was passed in 1950 to support war victims, whether civilians or veterans of the Wehrmacht or Waffen-SS.\"", "German Wehrmacht infantryman at the time of the Normandy Invasion of World War II (June 1944).\nWehrmacht, (German: “defense power”) the armed forces of the Third Reich. The three primary branches of the Wehrmacht were the Heer (army), Luftwaffe (air force), and Kriegsmarine (navy).\n## Creation and structure of the Wehrmacht\nAdolf HitlerAfter World War I, the Treaty of Versailles abolished conscription in Germany, reduced the size of the German army to 100,000 volunteer troops, sharply limited Germany’s surface fleet, outlawed its submarine fleet, and forbade the creation of a German air force. When Adolf Hitler rose to power as chancellor of Germany in 1933, he moved quickly to roll back these restrictions. He began developing German military aviation under the cloak of civilian production, and he worked with manufacturers to expand German military capacity. Krupp, for example, masked its tank program under the guise of tractor construction. After the death of Pres. Paul von Hindenburg on August 2, 1934, the offices of president and chancellor were merged, and Hitler became supreme commander of German armed forces. German Minister of War Werner von Blomberg, an ardent Hitler supporter, changed the oath of service for German troops; rather than pledging to defend the German constitution or the fatherland, they now swore unconditional obedience to Hitler.\nOn March 16, 1935, Hitler reintroduced conscription, effectively making public his previously clandestine rearmament program. The German army would be increased in size to 550,000 troops, and the Reichswehr of the Weimar Republic would be renamed the Wehrmacht. While the term Wehrmacht would most often be used to describe German land forces, it actually applied to the entire regular German military. The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW; Wehrmacht High Command) was designed to exercise command and control of the three branches of the Wehrmacht—the Heer (army), the Luftwaffe (air force), and the Kriegsmarine (navy)—each of which had its own high command.\nHeinrich Himmler and Adolf HitlerSS panzer grenadierAlso technically subordinate to the OKW was the Waffen-SS, which comprised the “political soldiers” of the Nazi Party. In addition to serving as Hitler’s personal bodyguard, administering concentration camps, and carrying out some of the most horrific atrocities of the Holocaust, men of the Waffen-SS fought as combat troops alongside the regular army. In practice the Waffen-SS ultimately answered to SS chief Heinrich Himmler, and its ranks swelled from several hundred men in 1933 to 39 divisions late in World War II. Although they were derisively dismissed as Himmler’s “asphalt soldiers” by the OKW high command, the troops of the Waffen-SS were superbly equipped and tended to have high morale. In early 1944 the Waffen-SS made up less than 5 percent of the Wehrmacht, but it accounted for nearly one-fourth of Germany’s panzer divisions and roughly one-third of the Wehrmacht’s panzer grenadier (mechanized infantry) divisions.\n## The Wehrmacht in World War II\n## Operation of the Wehrmacht\nThe Heer was by far the largest branch of the Wehrmacht, and, upon the outbreak of war, Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine units were theoretically subordinated to army command at a tactical level. This did not yield a seamless combined arms approach, however, as the OKW never functioned as a true joint staff. When cross-branch cooperation did occur, it was often the result of local commanders creating ad hoc task forces of limited duration.\n## The clash of commands\nRaeder, ErichBismarck battleshipCoordination was also complicated by the heads of the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe, who had no desire to see their branches diminished in importance. Hitler himself had little interest in sea power, and the naval commander in chief, Grand Adm. Erich Raeder, frequently clashed with the Führer over strategic matters. Other than the invasions of Denmark and Norway, which were planned and overseen by Raeder, German naval operations during the war consisted primarily of submarine attacks on Allied shipping. The ships of the German surface fleet—from converted frigates to battle cruisers such as the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau to the “pocket battleship” Graf Spee—were largely relegated to commerce raiding in support of the U-boat campaign. Just two modern battleships were deployed by Germany during World War II: the Bismarck was sunk within days of putting to sea in May 1941, and the Tirpitz was confined to Norwegian waters until it was finally sunk by British Lancaster bombers on November 12, 1944.\nAdolf Hitler and Benito MussoliniWhereas Hitler had a strained relationship with Raeder (who was forced to resign in January 1943), Luftwaffe chief Hermann Göring had been one of Hitler’s most ardent supporters since the earliest days of the Nazi Party. For this reason, Göring would hold a place of almost unequaled influence within the Third Reich, and he would wield near-total control of German air power. Because Göring openly disliked Raeder, the Kriegsmarine would not be allowed to develop a serious naval aviation capability. The Graf Zeppelin, the Reich’s only aircraft carrier, never entered service despite being almost completed, and its only significant contribution to the war effort was as a floating timber warehouse.\nIn 1940 Hitler bestowed upon Göring the title of Reichsmarschall des Grossdeutschen Reiches (“Marshal of the Empire”), further complicating the Wehrmacht chain of command. While the Luftwaffe technically answered to the OKW, Göring now outranked OKW chief Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel. Göring did suffer some diminished prestige as a result of the Luftwaffe’s failure to knock Britain out of the war during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz, but his authority remained unchallenged by anyone but Hitler until the end of the war.\n## Operation of the Wehrmacht\nThe Heer was by far the largest branch of the Wehrmacht, and, upon the outbreak of war, Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine units were theoretically subordinated to army command at a tactical level.

{"name": "Tractor", "documents": ["tractor, high-power, low-speed traction vehicle and power unit mechanically similar to an automobile or truck but designed for use off the road. The two main types are wheeled, which is the earliest form, and continuous track. Tractors are used in agriculture, construction, road building, etc., in the form of bulldozers, scrapers, and diggers. A notable feature of tractors in many applications is the power-takeoff accessory, used to operate stationary or drawn machinery and implements. steam-powered tractor\nThe first tractors, in the sense of powered traction vehicles, grew out of the stationary and portable steam engines operated on farms in the late 19th century and used to haul plows by the 1890s. In 1892 an Iowa blacksmith, John Froehlich, built the first farm vehicle powered by a gasoline engine. The first commercially successful manufacturers were C.W. Hart and C.H. Parr of Charles City, Iowa. By World War I the tractor was well established, and the U.S. Holt tractor (see also Caterpillar Inc.) was an inspiration for the tanks built for use in the war by the British and French.\ndisk plow\nBelt and power takeoffs, incorporated in tractors from the beginning, allow the tractor to power the use of mechanized implements and attachments. They were standardized first in the rear-mounted, transmission-derived power takeoff and later in the independent, or live-power, takeoff, which permitted operation of implements at a constant speed regardless of the vehicular speed. Many modern tractors also have a hydraulic power takeoff system operated by an oil pump, mounted either on the tractor or on a trailer.\npesticides\nA large number of tractor implements have been developed for a wide range of uses. In agriculture, key tractor implements include harrows and cultivators for weed control, seed drillers and broadcast seeders for sowing crops, transplanters for transplanting young plants into a field, spreaders for fertilizers and seeds, balers for hay and straw, sprayers for irrigation and pesticide application, and any number of other specialized tools. Some combines, used for cutting and threshing grains, are also tractor-pulled. Additional tractor implements are common in industry, grounds keeping, and construction. A simple box blade attachment is used to dig into the ground and then spread out the material into a flat, level layer, such as for a gravel path; a rear blade attachment is used similarly. Mowers, or cutters, cut grass, weeds, and other vegetation to a manageable height. Front end loaders have moveable arms and a variety of tools for scooping and lifting; pallet forks are common. Other attachments include post-hole diggers, snowblowers, and rotary tillers.\ntractor loader\nMost modern tractors are powered by internal-combustion engines running on gasoline, kerosene (paraffin), LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), or diesel fuel. Power is transmitted through a propeller shaft to a gearbox having 8 or 10 speeds and through the differential gear to the two large rear-drive wheels. The engine may be from about 12 to 120 horsepower or more. Until 1932, when oversize pneumatic rubber tires with deep treads were introduced, all wheel-type farm tractors had steel tires with high, tapering lugs to engage the ground and provide traction.\nartillery tractor\nCrawler, caterpillar, or tracklaying tractors run on two continuous tracks consisting of a number of plates or pads pivoted together and joined to form a pair of endless chains, each encircling two wheels on either side of the vehicle. These tractors provide better adhesion and lower ground pressure than the wheeled tractors do. Crawler tractors may be used on heavy, sticky soil or on very light soil that provides poor grip for a tire. The main chassis usually consists of a welded steel hull containing the engine and transmission. Tractors used on ground of irregular contours have tracks so mounted that their left and right front ends rise and fall independently of each other.\nFour-wheel-drive tractors can be used under many soil conditions that immobilize two-wheel-drive tractors and caterpillars. Because of their complicated construction and consequent high cost, their use has grown rather slowly.\nOne of the smallest, most basic types of tractors is the single-axle, or walking, tractor. It is a small tractor carried on a pair of wheels fixed to a single-drive axle; the operator usually walks behind, gripping a pair of handles. The engine is usually in front of the axle, and the tools are on a bar behind. This type of machine may be used with a considerable range of equipment, including plows, hoes, cultivators, hay balers, rototillers, bed shapers, snowblowers, sprayers, mowers, and two-wheeled trailers. When the tractor is coupled to a trailer, the operator rides.", "# Tractor\nA tractor is an engineering vehicle specifically designed to deliver a high tractive effort (or torque) at slow speeds, for the purposes of hauling a trailer or machinery such as that used in agriculture, mining or construction. Most commonly, the term is used to describe a farm vehicle that provides the power and traction to mechanize agricultural tasks, especially (and originally) tillage, and now many more. Agricultural implements may be towed behind or mounted on the tractor, and the tractor may also provide a source of power if the implement is mechanised.\n## Etymology\nThe word tractor was taken from Latin, being the agent noun of trahere \"to pull\". The first recorded use of the word meaning \"an engine or vehicle for pulling wagons or plows\" occurred in 1896, from the earlier term \"traction motor\" (1859).\n### National variations\nIn the UK, Ireland, Australia, India, Spain, Argentina, Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia, the Netherlands, and Germany, the word \"tractor\" usually means \"farm tractor\", and the use of the word \"tractor\" to mean other types of vehicles is familiar to the vehicle trade, but unfamiliar to much of the general public. In Canada and the US, the word may also refer to the road tractor portion of a tractor trailer truck, but also usually refers to the piece of farm equipment.\n## History\n### Traction engines\nThe first powered farm implements in the early 19th century were portable engines – steam engines on wheels that could be used to drive mechanical farm machinery by way of a flexible belt. Richard Trevithick designed the first 'semi-portable' stationary steam engine for agricultural use, known as a \"barn engine\" in 1812, and it was used to drive a corn threshing machine. The truly portable engine was invented in 1893 by William Tuxford of Boston, Lincolnshire who started manufacture of an engine built around a locomotive-style boiler with horizontal smoke tubes. A large flywheel was mounted on the crankshaft, and a stout leather belt was used to transfer the drive to the equipment being driven. In the 1850s, John Fowler used a Clayton & Shuttleworth portable engine to drive apparatus in the first public demonstrations of the application of cable haulage to cultivation.\nIn parallel with the early portable engine development, many engineers attempted to make them self-propelled – the fore-runners of the traction engine. In most cases this was achieved by fitting a sprocket on the end of the crankshaft, and running a chain from this to a larger sprocket on the rear axle. These experiments met with mixed success. The first proper traction engine, in the form recognisable today, was developed in 1859 when British engineer Thomas Aveling modified a Clayton & Shuttleworth portable engine, which had to be hauled from job to job by horses, into a self-propelled one. The alteration was made by fitting a long driving chain between the crankshaft and the rear axle.\nThe first half of the 1860s was a period of great experimentation but by the end of the decade the standard form of the traction engine had evolved and changed little over the next sixty years. It was widely adopted for agricultural use. The first tractors were steam-powered plowing engines. They were used in pairs, placed on either side of a field to haul a plow back and forth between them using a wire cable. In Britain Mann's and Garrett developed steam tractors for direct ploughing, but the heavy, wet soil of England meant that these designs were less economical than a team of horses. In the United States, where soil conditions permitted, steam tractors were used to direct-haul plows. Steam-powered agricultural engines remained in use well into the 20th century until reliable internal combustion engines had been developed.\n### Gasoline\nThe first gasoline powered tractors were built in Illinois, by John Charter combining single cylinder Otto engines with a Rumley Steam engine chasis, in 1889. In 1892, John Froelich built a gasoline-powered tractor in Clayton County, Iowa, US. A Van Duzen single-cylinder gasoline engine was mounted on a Robinson engine chassis, which could be controlled and propelled by Froelich's gear box. After receiving a patent, Froelich started up the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company and invested all of his assets. The venture was very unsuccessful, and by 1895 all was lost and he went out of business.\nRichard Hornsby & Sons are credited with producing and selling the first oil-engined tractor in Britain, invented by Herbert Akroyd Stuart. The Hornsby-Akroyd Patent Safety Oil Traction Engine was made in 1896 with a 20 hp (15 kW) engine. In 1897, it was bought by Mr. Locke-King, the first recorded British tractor sale. That year, it won a Silver Medal from the Royal Agricultural Society of England. It later returned to the factory for a caterpillar track fitting.\nThe first commercially successful light-weight petrol-powered general purpose tractor was built by Dan Albone, a British inventor in 1901. He filed for a patent on 15 February 1902 for his tractor design and then formed Ivel Agricultural Motors Limited. The other directors were Selwyn Edge, Charles Jarrott, John Hewitt and Lord Willoughby. He called his machine the Ivel Agricultural Motor; the word \"tractor\" came into common use after Hart-Parr created it. The Ivel Agricultural Motor was light, powerful and compact. It had one front wheel, with a solid rubber tyre, and two large rear wheels like a modern tractor. The engine used water cooling, utilizing the thermo-syphon effect. It had one forward and one reverse gear. A pulley wheel on the left hand side allowed it to be used as a stationary engine, driving a wide range of agricultural machinery. The 1903 sale price was £300. His tractor won a medal at the Royal Agricultural Show, in 1903 and 1904. About 500 were built, and many were exported all over the world. The original engine was made by Payne & Co. of Coventry. After 1906, French Aster engines were used.\nThe first successful American tractor was built by Charles W. Hart and Charles H. Parr. They developed a two-cylinder gasoline engine and set up their business in Charles City, Iowa. In 1903, the firm built 15 tractors. Their 14,000 pounds (6,400 kg) #3 is the oldest surviving internal combustion engine tractor in the United States, and is on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. The two-cylinder engine has a unique hit-and-miss firing cycle that produced 30 hp (22 kW) at the belt and 18 hp (13 kW) at the drawbar.\nIn 1908, the Saunderson Tractor and Implement Co. of Bedford introduced a four-wheel design, and became the largest tractor manufacturer in Britain at the time. While the earlier, heavier tractors were initially very successful, it became increasingly apparent at this time that the weight of a large supporting frame was less efficient than lighter designs. Henry Ford introduced a light-weight, mass-produced design which largely displaced the heavier designs. Some companies halfheartedly followed suit with mediocre designs, as if to disprove the concept, but they were largely unsuccessful in that endeavor.\nWhile unpopular at first, these gasoline-powered machines began to catch on in the 1910s, when they became smaller and more affordable. Henry Ford introduced the Fordson, a wildly popular mass-produced tractor, in 1917. They were built in the U.S., Ireland, England and Russia, and by 1923, Fordson had 77% of the U.S. market. The Fordson dispensed with a frame, using the strength of the engine block to hold the machine together. By the 1920s, tractors with gasoline-powered internal combustion engines had become the norm.\nThe first three-point hitches were experimented with in 1917. After Harry Ferguson applied for a British patent for his three-point hitch in 1926, they became popular. A three-point attachment of the implement to the tractor and the simplest and the only statically determinate way of joining two bodies in engineering. The Ferguson-Brown Company produced the Model A Ferguson-Brown tractor with a Ferguson-designed hydraulic hitch. In 1938 Ferguson entered into a collaboration with Henry Ford to produce the Ford-Ferguson 9N tractor. The three-point hitch soon became the favorite hitch attachment system among farmers around the world. This tractor model also included a rear Power Take Off (PTO) shaft that could be used to power three point hitch mounted implements such as sickle-bar mowers.\n## Design, power and transmission\n### Configuration\nTractors can be generally classified by number of axles or wheels, with main categories of two-wheel tractors (single-axle tractors) and four-wheel tractors (two-axle tractors); more axles are possible but uncommon. Among four-wheel tractors (two-axle tractors), most are two-wheel drive (usually at the rear); but many are two-wheel drive with front wheel assist, four-wheel drive (often with articulated steering), or track crawler (with steel or rubber tracks).\nThe classic farm tractor is a simple open vehicle, with two very large driving wheels on an axle below a single seat (the seat and steering wheel consequently are in the center), and the engine in front of the driver, with two steerable wheels below the engine compartment. This basic design has remained unchanged for a number of years after being pioneered by Wallis, but enclosed cabs are fitted on almost all modern models, for operator safety and comfort.\nIn some localities with heavy or wet soils, notably in the Central Valley of California, the \"Caterpillar\" or \"crawler\" type of tracked tractor became popular due to superior traction and flotation. These were usually maneuvered through the use of turning brake pedals and separate track clutches operated by levers rather than a steering wheel.\nFour-wheel drive tractors began to appear in the 1960s. Some four-wheel drive tractors have the standard \"two large, two small\" configuration typical of smaller tractors, while some have four large, powered wheels. The larger tractors are typically an articulated, center-hinged design steered by hydraulic cylinders that move the forward power unit while the trailing unit is not steered separately.\nIn the early 21st century, articulated or non-articulated, steerable multitrack tractors have largely supplanted the Caterpillar type for farm use. Larger types of modern farm tractors include articulated four-wheel or eight-wheel drive units with one or two power units which are hinged in the middle and steered by hydraulic clutches or pumps. A relatively recent development is the replacement of wheels or steel crawler-type tracks with flexible, steel-reinforced rubber tracks, usually powered by hydrostatic or completely hydraulic driving mechanisms. The configuration of these tractors bears little resemblance to the classic farm tractor design.\n### Engine and fuels\nThe predecessors of modern tractors, traction engines, used steam engines for power.\n#### Gasoline and kerosene\nSince the turn of the 20th century, internal combustion engines have been the power source of choice. Between 1900 and 1960, gasoline was the predominant fuel, with kerosene (the Rumely Oil Pull was the most notable of this kind)being a common alternative. Generally, one engine could burn any of those, although cold starting was easiest on gasoline. Often, a small auxiliary fuel tank was available to hold gasoline for cold starting and warm-up, while the main fuel tank held whatever fuel was most convenient or least expensive for the particular farmer. In the United Kingdom, a gasoline-kerosene engine is known as a petrol-paraffin engine.\n#### Diesel\nDieselisation gained momentum starting in the 1960s, and modern farm tractors usually employ diesel engines, which range in power output from 18 to 575 horsepower (15 to 480 kW). Size and output are dependent on application, with smaller tractors used for lawn mowing, landscaping, orchard work, and truck farming, and larger tractors for vast fields of wheat, corn, soy, and other bulk crops.\n#### Liquefied petroleum gas\nLiquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or propane also have been used as tractor fuels, but require special pressurized fuel tanks and filling equipment and produced less power, so are less prevalent in most markets.\n#### Wood\nDuring the second world war, Petrolium based fuel was scarce in many European nations. So they resorted to using wood gasifires on every vehicle, including tractors.\n#### Biodiesel\nIn some countries such as Germany, biodiesel is often used. Some other biofuels such as straight vegetable oil are also being used by some farmers.\n#### Electric powered\nPrototype battery powered electric tractors are being developed by a German company, Fendt, and by two US companies, Solectrac and Monarch Tractor. John Deere's protoype electric tractor is a plug-in, powered by an electrical cable. Kubota is prototyping an autonomous electric tractor.\n### Transmission\nMost older farm tractors use a manual transmission with several gear ratios, typically three to six, sometimes multiplied into two or three ranges. This arrangement provides a set of discrete ratios that, combined with the varying of the throttle, allow final-drive speeds from less than one up to about 25 miles per hour (40 km/h), with the lower speeds used for working the land and the highest speed used on the road.\nSlow, controllable speeds are necessary for most of the operations performed with a tractor. They help give the farmer a larger degree of control in certain situations, such as field work. When travelling on public roads, the slow operating speeds can cause problems, such as long queues or tailbacks, which can delay or annoy motorists in cars and trucks. These motorists are responsible for being duly careful around farm tractors and sharing the road with them, but many shirk this responsibility, so various ways to minimize the interaction or minimize the speed differential are employed where feasible. Some countries (for example the Netherlands) employ a road sign on some roads that means \"no farm tractors\". Some modern tractors, such as the JCB Fastrac, are now capable of much higher road speeds of around 50 mph (80 km/h).\nOlder tractors usually have unsynchronized transmission designs, which often require the operator to engage the clutch to shift between gears. This mode of use is inherently unsuited to some of the work tractors do, and has been circumvented in various ways over the years. For existing unsynchronized tractors, the methods of circumvention are double clutching or power-shifting, both of which require the operator to rely on skill to speed-match the gears while shifting, and are undesirable from a risk-mitigation standpoint because of what can go wrong if the operator makes a mistake – transmission damage is possible, and loss of vehicle control can occur if the tractor is towing a heavy load either uphill or downhill – something that tractors often do. Therefore, operator's manuals for most of these tractors state one must always stop the tractor before shifting.\nIn newer designs, unsynchronized transmission designs were replaced with synchronization or with continuously variable transmissions (CVTs). Either a synchronized manual transmission with enough available gear ratios (often achieved with dual ranges, high and low) or a CVT allow the engine speed to be matched to the desired final-drive speed, while keeping engine speed within the appropriate speed (as measured in rotations per minute or rpm) range for power generation (the working range) (whereas throttling back to achieve the desired final-drive speed is a trade-off that leaves the working range). The problems, solutions, and developments described here also describe the history of transmission evolution in semi-trailer trucks. The biggest difference is fleet turnover; whereas most of the old road tractors have long since been scrapped, many of the old farm tractors are still in use. Therefore, old transmission design and operation is primarily just of historical interest in trucking, whereas in farming it still often affects daily life.\n## Hitches and power applications\nThe power produced by the engine must be transmitted to the implement or equipment to do the actual work intended for the equipment. This may be accomplished via a drawbar or hitch system if the implement is to be towed or otherwise pulled through the tractive power of the engine, or via a pulley or power takeoff system if the implement is stationary, or a combination of the two.\n### Drawbars\nPlows and other tillage equipment are most commonly connected to the tractor via a drawbar. The classic drawbar is simply a steel bar attached to the tractor (or in some cases, as in the early Fordsons, cast as part of the rear transmission housing) to which the hitch of the implement was attached with a pin or by a loop and clevis. The implement could be readily attached and removed, allowing the tractor to be used for other purposes on a daily basis. If the tractor was equipped with a swinging drawbar, then it could be set at the center or offset from center to allow the tractor to run outside the path of the implement.\nThe drawbar system necessitated the implement having its own running gear (usually wheels) and in the case of a plow, chisel cultivator or harrow, some sort of lift mechanism to raise it out of the ground at turns or for transport. Drawbars necessarily posed a rollover risk depending on how the tractive torque was applied. The Fordson tractor (of which more units were produced and placed in service than any other farm tractor) was prone to roll backward due to an excessively short wheelbase. The linkage between the implement and the tractor usually had some slack which could lead to jerky starts and greater wear and tear on the tractor and the equipment.\nDrawbars were appropriate to the dawn of mechanization, because they were very simple in concept and because as the tractor replaced the horse, existing horse-drawn implements usually already had running gear. As the history of mechanization progressed, the advantages of other hitching systems became apparent, leading to new developments (see below). Depending on the function for which a tractor is used, though, the drawbar is still one of the usual means of attaching an implement to a tractor (see photo at left).\n### Fixed mounts\nSome tractor manufacturers produced matching equipment that could be directly mounted on the tractor. Examples included front-end loaders, belly mowers, row crop cultivators, corn pickers and corn planters. In most cases, these fixed mounts were proprietary and unique to each make of tractor, so an implement produced by John Deere, for example, could not be attached to a Minneapolis Moline tractor. Another disadvantage was mounting usually required some time and labor, resulting in the implement being semi-permanently attached with bolts or other mounting hardware. Usually, it was impractical to remove the implement and reinstall it on a day-to-day basis. As a result, the tractor was unavailable for other uses and dedicated to a single use for an appreciable period of time. An implement was generally mounted at the beginning of its season of use (such as tillage, planting or harvesting) and removed when the season ended.\n### Three-point and quick\nThe drawbar system was virtually the exclusive method of attaching implements (other than direct attachment to the tractor) before Harry Ferguson developed the three-point hitch. Equipment attached to the three-point hitch can be raised or lowered hydraulically with a control lever. The equipment attached to the three-point hitch is usually completely supported by the tractor. Another way to attach an implement is via a quick hitch, which is attached to the three-point hitch. This enables a single person to attach an implement quicker and put the person in less danger when attaching the implement.\nThe three-point hitch revolutionized farm tractors and their implements. While the Ferguson system was still under patent, other manufacturers developed new hitching systems to try to fend off some of Ferguson's competitive advantage. For example, International Harvester's Farmall tractors gained a two-point \"Fast Hitch\", and John Deere had a power lift that was somewhat similar to the more flexible Ferguson invention. Once the patent protection expired on the three-point hitch, it became an industry standard.\nAlmost every tractor today features Ferguson's three-point linkage or a derivative of it. This hitch allows for easy attachment and detachment of implements while allowing the implement to function as a part of the tractor, almost as if it were attached by a fixed mount. Previously, when the implement hit an obstacle, the towing link broke or the tractor flipped over. Ferguson's idea was to combine a connection via two lower and one upper lift arms that were connected to a hydraulic lifting ram. The ram was, in turn, connected to the upper of the three links so the increased drag (as when a plough hits a rock) caused the hydraulics to lift the implement until the obstacle was passed.\nRecently, Bobcat's patent on its front loader connection (inspired by these earlier systems) has expired, and compact tractors are now being outfitted with quick-connect attachments for their front-end loaders.\n### Power take-off systems and hydraulics\nIn addition to towing an implement or supplying tractive power through the wheels, most tractors have a means to transfer power to another machine such as a baler, swather, or mower. Unless it functions solely by pulling it through or over the ground, a towed implement needs its own power source (such as a baler or combine with a separate engine) or else a means of transmitting power from the tractor to the mechanical operations of the equipment.\nEarly tractors used belts or cables wrapped around the flywheel or a separate belt pulley to power stationary equipment, such as a threshing machine, buzz saw, silage blower, or stationary baler. In most cases, it was impractical for the tractor and equipment to move with a flexible belt or cable between them, so this system required the tractor to remain in one location, with the work brought to the equipment, or the tractor to be relocated at each turn and the power set-up reapplied (as in cable-drawn plowing systems used in early steam tractor operations).\nModern tractors use a power take-off (PTO) shaft to provide rotary power to machinery that may be stationary or pulled. The PTO shaft generally is at the rear of the tractor, and can be connected to an implement that is either towed by a drawbar or a three-point hitch. This eliminates the need for a separate, implement-mounted power source, which is almost never seen in modern farm equipment. It is also optional to get a front PTO as well when buying a new tractor.\nVirtually all modern tractors can also provide external hydraulic fluid and electrical power to the equipment they are towing, either by hoses or wires.\n## Operation\nModern tractors have many electrical switches and levers in the cab for controlling the multitude of different functions available on the tractor.\n### Pedals\nSome modern farm tractors retain a traditional manual transmission; increasingly they have hydraulically driven powershift transmissions and CVT, which vastly simplify operation.\nThose with powershift transmissions have identical pedal arrangements on the floor for the operator to actuate, replacing a clutch pedal on the far left with an inching pedal that cuts off hydraulic flow to the clutches. Twinned brake pedals - one each for left and right side wheels- are placed together on the right side. Some have a pedal for a foot throttle on the far right. Unlike automobiles, throttle speed can also be controlled by a hand-operated lever (\"hand throttle\"), which may be set to a fixed position. This helps provide a constant speed in field work. It also helps provide continuous power for stationary tractors that are operating an implement by PTO shaft or axle driven belt. The foot throttle gives the operator more automobile-like control over the speed of a mobile tractor in any operation.\nSome modern tractors also have (or offer as optional equipment) a button on the gear stick for controlling the clutch, in addition to the standard pedal, allowing for gear changes and the tractor to be brought to a stop without using the foot pedal to engage the clutch. Others have a button for temporarily increasing throttle speed to improve hydraulic flow to implements, such as a front end loader bucket.\nIndependent left and right brake pedals are provided to allow improved steering (by engaging the side one wishes to turn to, slowing or stopping its wheel) and improved traction in soft and slippery conditions (by transferring rotation to the wheel with better grip). Some users prefer to lock both pedals together, or utilize a partial lock that allows the left pedal to be depressed independently but engages both when the right is applied. This may be in the form of a swinging or sliding bolt that may be readily engaged or disengaged in the field without tools.\nFoot pedal throttle control is mostly a returning feature of newer tractors. In the UK, foot pedal use to control engine speed while travelling on the road is mandatory. Some tractors, especially those designed for row-crop work, have a 'de-accelerator' pedal, which operates in the reverse fashion of an automobile throttle, slowing the engine when applied. This allows control over the speed of a tractor with its throttle set high for work, as when repeatedly slowing to make U-turns at the end of crop rows in fields.\nA front-facing foot button is traditionally included just ahead of the driver's seat (designed to be pressed by the operator's heel) to engage the rear differential lock (diff-lock), which prevents wheel slip. The differential normally allows driving wheels to operate at their own speeds, as required, for example, by the different radius each takes in a turn. This allows the outside wheel to travel faster than the inside wheel, thereby traveling further during a turn. In low-traction conditions on a soft surface, the same mechanism can allow one wheel to slip, wasting its torque and further reducing traction. The differential lock overrides this, forcing both wheels to turn at the same speed, reducing wheel slip and improving traction. Care must be taken to unlock the differential before turning, usually by hitting the pedal a second time, since the tractor with good traction cannot perform a turn with the diff-lock engaged. In many modern tractors, this pedal is replaced with an electrical switch.\n### Levers and switches\nMany functions once controlled with levers have been replaced with some model of electrical switch with the rise of indirect computer controlling of functions in modern tractors.\nUntil the late of the 1950s, tractors had a single register of gears, hence one gear stick, often with three to five forward gears and one reverse. Then, group gears were introduced, and another gear stick was added. Later, control of the forward-reverse direction was moved to a special stick attached at the side of the steering wheel, which allowed forward or reverse travel in any gear. Now, with CVTs or other gear types, fewer sticks control the transmission, and some are replaced with electrical switches or are totally computer-controlled.\nThe three-point hitch was controlled with a lever for adjusting the position, or as with the earliest ones, just the function for raising or lowering the hitch. With modern electrical systems, it is often replaced with a potentiometer for the lower bound position and another one for the upper bound, and a switch allowing automatic adjustment of the hitch between these settings.\nThe external hydraulics also originally had levers, but now are often replaced with some form of electrical switch; the same is true for the power take-off shaft.\n## Safety\nAgriculture in the United States is one of the most hazardous industries, only surpassed by mining and construction. No other farm machine is so identified with the hazards of production agriculture as the tractor. Tractor-related injuries account for approximately 32% of the fatalities and 6% of the nonfatal injuries in agriculture. Over 50% is attributed to tractor overturns.\nThe roll-over protection structure (ROPS) and seat belt, when worn, are the most important safety devices to protect operators from death during tractor overturns.\nModern tractors have a ROPS to prevent an operator from being crushed when overturning. This is especially important in open-air tractors, where the ROPS is a steel beam that extends above the operator's seat. For tractors with operator cabs, the ROPS is part of the frame of the cab. A ROPS with enclosed cab further reduces the likelihood of serious injury because the operator is protected by the sides and windows of the cab.\nThese structures were first required by legislation in Sweden in 1959. Before they were required, some farmers died when their tractors rolled on top of them. Row-crop tractors, before ROPS, were particularly dangerous because of their 'tricycle' design with the two front wheels spaced close together and angled inward toward the ground. Some farmers were killed by rollovers while operating tractors along steep slopes. Others have been killed while attempting to tow or pull an excessive load from above axle height, or when cold weather caused the tires to freeze to the ground, in both cases causing the tractor to pivot around the rear axle. ROPS were first required in the United States in 1986, non-retroactively. ROPS adoption by farmers is thus incomplete. To treat this problem, CROPS (cost-effective roll-over protection structures) have been developed to encourage farmers to retrofit older tractors.\nFor the ROPS to work as designed, the operator must stay within its protective frame and wear the seat belt.\nIn addition to ROPS, U.S. manufacturers add instructional seats on tractors with enclosed cabs. The tractors have a ROPS with seatbelts for both the operator and passenger. This instructional seat is intended to be used for training new tractor operators, but can also be used to diagnose machine problems.  The misuse of an instructional seat increases the likelihood of injury, especially when children are transported. The International Organization for Standardization’s ISO standard 23205:2014 specifies the minimum design and performance requirements for an instructional seat and states that the instructional seat is neither intended for, nor is it designed for use by children.  Despite this, upwards of 40% of farm families give their children rides on tractors, often using these instructional seats.\n## Applications and variations\n### Farm\nThe most common use of the term \"tractor\" is for the vehicles used on farms. The farm tractor is used for pulling or pushing agricultural machinery or trailers, for plowing, tilling, disking, harrowing, planting, and similar tasks.\nA variety of specialty farm tractors have been developed for particular uses. These include \"row crop\" tractors with adjustable tread width to allow the tractor to pass down rows of cereals, maize, tomatoes or other crops without crushing the plants, \"wheatland\" or \"standard\" tractors with fixed wheels and a lower center of gravity for plowing and other heavy field work for broadcast crops, and \"high crop\" tractors with adjustable tread and increased ground clearance, often used in the cultivation of cotton and other high-growing row crop plant operations, and \"utility tractors\", typically smaller tractors with a low center of gravity and short turning radius, used for general purposes around the farmstead. Many utility tractors are used for nonfarm grading, landscape maintenance and excavation purposes, particularly with loaders, backhoes, pallet forks and similar devices. Small garden or lawn tractors designed for suburban and semirural gardening and landscape maintenance are produced in a variety of configurations, and also find numerous uses on a farmstead.\nSome farm-type tractors are found elsewhere than on farms: with large universities' gardening departments, in public parks, or for highway workman use with blowtorch cylinders strapped to the sides and a pneumatic drill air compressor permanently fastened over the power take-off. These are often fitted with grass (turf) tyres which are less damaging to soft surfaces than agricultural tires.\n#### Precision\nSpace technology has been incorporated into agriculture in the form of GPS devices, and robust on-board computers installed as optional features on farm tractors. These technologies are used in modern, precision farming techniques. The spin-offs from the space race have actually facilitated automation in plowing and the use of autosteer systems (drone on tractors that are manned but only steered at the end of a row), the idea being to neither overlap and use more fuel nor leave streaks when performing jobs such as cultivating. Several tractor companies have also been working on producing a driverless tractor.\n### Engineering\nThe durability and engine power of tractors made them very suitable for engineering tasks. Tractors can be fitted with engineering tools such as dozer blades, buckets, hoes, rippers, etc. The most common attachments for the front of a tractor are dozer blades or buckets. When attached to engineering tools, the tractor is called an engineering vehicle.\nA bulldozer is a track-type tractor with a blade attached in the front and a rope-winch behind. Bulldozers are very powerful tractors and have excellent ground-hold, as their main tasks are to push or drag.\nBulldozers have been further modified over time to evolve into new machines which are capable of working in ways that the original bulldozer can not. One example is that loader tractors were created by removing the blade and substituting a large volume bucket and hydraulic arms which can raise and lower the bucket, thus making it useful for scooping up earth, rock and similar loose material to load it into trucks.\nA front-loader or loader is a tractor with an engineering tool which consists of two hydraulic powered arms on either side of the front engine compartment and a tilting implement. This is usually a wide-open box called a bucket, but other common attachments are a pallet fork and a bale grappler.\nOther modifications to the original bulldozer include making the machine smaller to let it operate in small work areas where movement is limited. Also, tiny wheeled loaders, officially called skid-steer loaders, but nicknamed \"Bobcat\" after the original manufacturer, are particularly suited for small excavation projects in confined areas.\n### Backhoe\nThe most common variation of the classic farm tractor is the backhoe, also called a backhoe-loader. As the name implies, it has a loader assembly on the front and a backhoe on the back. Backhoes attach to a three-point hitch on farm or industrial tractors. Industrial tractors are often heavier in construction, particularly with regards to the use of a steel grill for protection from rocks and the use of construction tires. When the backhoe is permanently attached, the machine usually has a seat that can swivel to the rear to face the hoe controls. Removable backhoe attachments almost always have a separate seat on the attachment.\nBackhoe-loaders are very common and can be used for a wide variety of tasks: construction, small demolitions, light transportation of building materials, powering building equipment, digging holes, loading trucks, breaking asphalt and paving roads. Some buckets have retractable bottoms, enabling them to empty their loads more quickly and efficiently. Buckets with retractable bottoms are also often used for grading and scratching off sand. The front assembly may be a removable attachment or permanently mounted. Often the bucket can be replaced with other devices or tools.\nTheir relatively small frames and precise controls make backhoe-loaders very useful and common in urban engineering projects, such as construction and repairs in areas too small for larger equipment. Their versatility and compact size make them one of the most popular urban construction vehicles.\nIn the UK and Ireland, the word \"JCB\" is used colloquially as a genericized trademark for any such type of engineering vehicle. The term JCB now appears in the Oxford English Dictionary, although it is still legally a trademark of J. C. Bamford Ltd. The term \"digger\" is also commonly used.\n### Compact utility\nA compact utility tractor (CUT) is a smaller version of an agricultural tractor, but designed primarily for landscaping and estate management tasks, rather than for planting and harvesting on a commercial scale. Typical CUTs range from 20–50 hp (15–37 kW) with available power take-off (PTO) power ranging from 15–45 hp (11–34 kW). CUTs are often equipped with both a mid-mounted and a standard rear PTO, especially those below 40 hp (30 kW). The mid-mount PTO shaft typically rotates at/near 2000 rpm and is typically used to power mid-mount finish mowers, front-mounted snow blowers or front-mounted rotary brooms. The rear PTO is standardized at 540 rpm for the North American markets, but in some parts of the world, a dual 540/1000 rpm PTO is standard, and implements are available for either standard in those markets.\nOne of the most common attachment for a CUT is the front-end loader or FEL. Like the larger agricultural tractors, a CUT will have an adjustable, hydraulically controlled three-point hitch. Typically, a CUT will have four-wheel drive, or more correctly four-wheel assist. Modern CUTs often feature hydrostatic transmissions, but many variants of gear-drive transmissions are also offered from low priced, simple gear transmissions to synchronized transmissions to advanced glide-shift transmissions. All modern CUTs feature government-mandated roll over protection structures just like agricultural tractors. The most well-known brands in North America include Kubota, John Deere Tractor, New Holland Ag, Case-Farmall and Massey Ferguson. Although less common, compact backhoes are often attached to compact utility tractors.\nCompact utility tractors require special, smaller implements than full-sized agricultural tractors. Very common implements include the box blade, the grader blade, the landscape rake, the post hole digger (or post hole auger), the rotary cutter (slasher or a brush hog), a mid- or rear-mount finish mower, a broadcast seeder, a subsoiler and the rototiller (rotary tiller). In northern climates, a rear-mounted snow blower is very common; some smaller CUT models are available with front-mounted snow blowers powered by mid-PTO shafts. Implement brands outnumber tractor brands, so CUT owners have a wide selection of implements.\nFor small-scale farming or large-scale gardening, some planting and harvesting implements are sized for CUTs. One- and two-row planting units are commonly available, as are cultivators, sprayers and different types of seeders (slit, rotary and drop). One of the first CUTs offered for small farms of three to 30 acres and for small jobs on larger farms was a three-wheeled unit, with the rear wheel being the drive wheel, offered by Sears & Roebuck in 1954 and priced at $598 for the basic model.\n### Standard\nThe earliest tractors were called \"standard\" tractors, and were intended almost solely for plowing and harrowing before planting, which were difficult tasks for humans and draft animals. They were characterized by a low, rearward seating position, fixed-width tread, and low ground clearance. These early tractors were cumbersome, and ill-suited to enter a field of planted row crops for weed control. The \"standard\" tractor definition is no longer in current use. However, tractors with fixed wheel spacing and a low center of gravity are well-suited as loaders, forklifts and backhoes, so that the configuration continues in use without the \"standard\" nomenclature.\n### Row-crop\nA general-purpose or row-crop tractor is tailored specifically to the growing of crops grown in rows, and most especially to cultivating these crops. These tractors are universal machines, capable of both primary tillage and cultivation of a crop.\nThe row-crop tractor category evolved rather than appearing overnight, but the International Harvester (IH) Farmall is often considered the \"first\" tractor of the category. Some earlier tractors of the 1910s and 1920s approached the form factor from the heavier side, as did motorized cultivators from the lighter side, but the Farmall brought all of the salient features together into one package, with a capable distribution network to ensure its commercial success. In the new form factor that the Farmall popularized, the cultivator was mounted in the front so it was easily visible. Additionally, the tractor had a narrow front end; the front tires were spaced very closely and angled in toward the bottom. The back wheels straddled two rows with their spacing adjustable depending on row spacing, and the unit could cultivate four rows at once. Where wide front wheels were used, they often could be adjusted as well. Tractors with non-adjustable spacing were called \"standard\" or \"wheatland\", and were chiefly meant for pulling plows or other towed implements, typically with a lower overall tractor height than row-crop models.\nFrom 1924 until 1963, Farmalls were the largest selling row-crop tractors.\nTo compete, John Deere designed the Model C, which had a wide front and could cultivate three rows at once. Only 112 prototypes were made, as Deere realized it would lose sales to Farmall if its model did less. In 1928, Deere released the Model C anyway, only as the Model GP (General Purpose) to avoid confusion with the Model D when ordered over the then unclear telephone.\nOliver refined its \"Row Crop\" model early in 1930. Until 1935, the 18–27 was Oliver–Hart-Parr's only row-crop tractor.\nMany Oliver row-crop models are referred to as \"Oliver Row Crop 77\", \"Oliver Row Crop 88\", etc.\nMany early row-crop tractors had a tricycle design with two closely spaced front tires, and some even had a single front tire. This made it dangerous to operate on the side of a steep hill; as a result, many farmers died from tractor rollovers. Also, early row-crop tractors had no rollover protection system (ROPS), meaning if the tractor flipped back, the operator could be crushed. Sweden was the first country which passed legislation requiring ROPS, in 1959.\nOver 50% of tractor related injuries and deaths are attributed to tractor rollover.\nCanadian agricultural equipment manufacturer Versatile makes row-crop tractors that are 265 to 365 horsepower (198 to 272 kW); powered by an 8.9 liter Cummins Diesel engine.\nCase IH and New Holland of CNH Industrial both produce high horsepower front-wheel-assist row crop tractors with available rear tracks. Case IH also has a 500 hp (370 kW) four-wheel drive track system called Rowtrac.\nJohn Deere has an extensive line of available row crop tractors ranging from 140 to 400 horsepower (100 to 300 kW).\nModern row crop tractors have rollover protection systems in the form of a reinforced cab or a roll bar.\n### Garden\nGarden tractors, sometimes called lawn tractors, are small, light tractors designed for use in domestic gardens, lawns, and small estates. Lawn tractors are designed for cutting grass and snow removal, while garden tractors are for small property cultivation. In the U.S., the term riding lawn mower today often is used to refer to mid- or rear-engined machines. Front-engined tractor layout machines designed primarily for cutting grass and light towing are called lawn tractors; heavier-duty tractors of similar size are garden tractors. Garden tractors are capable of mounting a wider array of attachments than lawn tractors. Unlike lawn tractors and rear-engined riding mowers, garden tractors are powered by horizontal-crankshaft engines with a belt-drive to transaxle-type transmissions (usually of four or five speeds, although some may also have two-speed reduction gearboxes, drive-shafts, or hydrostatic or hydraulic drives). Garden tractors from Wheel Horse, Cub Cadet, Economy (Power King), John Deere, Massey Ferguson and Case Ingersoll are built in this manner. The engines are generally one- or two-cylinder petrol (gasoline) engines, although diesel engine models are also available, especially in Europe. Typically, diesel-powered garden tractors are larger and heavier-duty than gasoline-powered units and compare more similarly to compact utility tractors.\nVisually, the distinction between a garden tractor and a lawn tractor is often hard to make – generally, garden tractors are more sturdily built, with stronger frames, 12-inch or larger wheels mounted with multiple lugs (most lawn tractors have a single bolt or clip on the hub), heavier transaxles, and ability to accommodate a wide range of front, belly, and rear mounted attachments.\n### Two-wheel\nAlthough most people think primarily of four-wheel vehicles when they think of tractors, a tractor may have one or more axles. The key benefit is the power itself, which only takes one axle to provide. Single-axle tractors, more often called two-wheel tractors or walk-behind tractors, have had many users since the introduction of the internal combustion engine tractors. They tend to be small and affordable, this was especially true before the 1960s when a walk-behind tractor could often be more affordable than a two-axle tractor of comparable power. Today's compact utility tractors and advanced garden tractors may negate most of that market advantage, but two-wheel tractors still have a following, especially among those who already own one. Countries where two-wheel tractors are especially prevalent today include Thailand, China, Bangladesh, India, and other Southeast Asia countries. Most two-wheel tractors today are specialty tractors made for one purpose, such as snow blowers, push tillers, and self propelled push mowers.\n### Orchard\nTractors tailored to use in fruit orchards typically have features suited to passing under tree branches with impunity. These include a lower overall profile; reduced tree-branch-snagging risk (via underslung exhaust pipes rather than smoke-stack-style exhaust, and large sheetmetal cowlings and fairings that allow branches to deflect and slide off rather than catch); spark arrestors on the exhaust tips; and often wire cages to protect the operator from snags.\n### Automobile conversions and other homemade\nThe ingenuity of farm mechanics, coupled in some cases with OEM or aftermarket assistance, has often resulted in the conversion of automobiles for use as farm tractors. In the United States, this trend was especially strong from the 1910s through 1950s. It began early in the development of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, with blacksmiths and amateur mechanics tinkering in their shops. Especially during the interwar period, dozens of manufacturers (Montgomery Ward among them) marketed aftermarket kits for converting Ford Model Ts for use as tractors. (These were sometimes called 'Hoover wagons' during the Great Depression, although this term was usually reserved for automobiles converted to horse-drawn buggy use when gasoline was unavailable or unaffordable. During the same period, another common name was \"Doodlebug\", after the popular kit by the same name.) Ford even considered producing an \"official\" optional kit. Many Model A Fords also were converted for this purpose. In later years, some farm mechanics have been known to convert more modern trucks or cars for use as tractors, more often as curiosities or for recreational purposes (rather than out of the earlier motives of pure necessity or frugality).\nDuring World War II, a shortage of tractors in Sweden led to the development of the so-called \"EPA\" tractor (EPA was a chain of discount stores and it was often used to signify something lacking in quality). An EPA tractor was simply an automobile, truck or lorry, with the passenger space cut off behind the front seats, equipped with two gearboxes in a row. When done to an older car with a ladder frame, the result was similar to a tractor and could be used as one. After the war it remained popular as a way for young people without a driver's license to own something similar to a car. Since it was legally seen as a tractor, it could be driven from 16 years of age and only required a tractor license. Eventually, the legal loophole was closed and no new EPA tractors were allowed to be made, but the remaining ones were still legal, which led to inflated prices and many protests from people who preferred EPA tractors to ordinary cars.\nThe Swedish government eventually replaced them with the so called \"A-tractor\" which now had its speed limited to 30 km/h and allowed people aged 16 and older to drive the cars with a moped license.\nThe German occupation of Italy during World War II resulted in a severe shortage of mechanized farm equipment. The destruction of tractors was a sort of scorched-earth strategy used to reduce the independence of the conquered. The shortage of tractors in that area of Europe was the origin of Lamborghini. The war was also the inspiration for dual-purpose vehicles such as the Land Rover. Based on the Jeep, the company made a vehicle that combined PTO, tillage, 4wd, and transportation.\nIn March 1975, a similar type of vehicle was introduced in Sweden, the A tractor ; the main difference is an A tractor has a top speed of 30 km/h. This is usually done by fitting two gearboxes in a row and only using one. The Volvo Duett was, for a long time, the primary choice for conversion to an EPA or A tractor, but since supplies have dried up, other cars have been used, in most cases another Volvo. The SFRO is a Swedish organization advocating homebuilt and modified vehicles.\nAnother type of homemade tractors are ones that are fabricated from scratch. The \"from scratch\" description is relative, as often individual components will be repurposed from earlier vehicles or machinery (e.g., engines, gearboxes, axle housings), but the tractor's overall chassis is essentially designed and built by the owner (e.g., a frame is welded from bar stock—channel stock, angle stock, flat stock, etc.). As with automobile conversions, the heyday of this type of tractor, at least in developed economies, lies in the past, when there were large populations of blue-collar workers for whom metalworking and farming were prevalent parts of their lives. (For example, many 19th- and 20th-century New England and Midwestern machinists and factory workers had grown up on farms.) Backyard fabrication was a natural activity to them (whereas it might seem daunting to most people today).\n### Nomenclature\nThe term \"tractor\" (US and Canada) or \"tractor unit\" (UK) is also applied to:\nRoad tractors, tractor units or traction heads, familiar as the front end of an articulated lorry / semi-trailer truck. They are heavy-duty vehicles with large engines and several axles. The majority of these tractors are designed to pull long semi-trailers, most often to transport freight over a significant distance, and is connected to the trailer with a fifth wheel coupling. In England, this type of \"tractor\" is often called an \"artic cab\" (short for \"articulated\" cab). A minority is the ballast tractor, whose load is hauled from a drawbar. Pushback tractors are used on airports to move aircraft on the ground, most commonly pushing aircraft away from their parking stands. Locomotive tractors (engines) or rail car movers – the amalgamation of machines, electrical generators, controls and devices that comprise the traction component of railway vehicles Artillery tractors – vehicles used to tow artillery pieces of varying weights. NASA and other space agencies use very large tractors to move large launch vehicles and Space Shuttles between their hangars and launch pads. A pipe-tractor is a device used for conveying advanced instruments into pipes for measurement and data logging, and the purging of well holes, sewer pipes and other inaccessible tubes.\nNon-agricultural tractors Diesel-electric locomotive at work A Trackmobile 4150 A tractor-driven road roller Aircraft pushback tractor Road tractor pulling a flatbed trailer Unimog 70200 A Lombard steam log hauler\n## Nebraska tests\nNebraska tractor tests are tests mandated by the Nebraska Tractor Test Law and administered by the University of Nebraska, that objectively test the performance of all brands of tractors, 40 horsepower or more, sold in Nebraska. In the 1910s and 1920s, an era of snake oil sales and advertising tactics, the Nebraska tests helped farmers throughout North America to see through marketing claims and make informed buying decisions. The tests continue today, making sure tractors fulfill the manufacturer's advertised claims.\n## Manufacturers\nSome of the many tractor manufacturers and brands worldwide include:\nIn addition to commercial manufacturers, the Open Source Ecology group has developed several working prototypes of an open source hardware tractor called the LifeTrac as part of its Global Village Construction Set.\n## Gallery\nAgricultural tractors A Ford tractor in Brazil Modern tractors, an Ursus 11054 and Fendt 820 A John Deere 9320 at a construction site in the US A scale model of a modern Ursus and Fendt tractor in Germany Farm tractor in Balnain, Scotland A tractor pulling a chisel plow in Slovenia"], "selected_questions": ["What is the distinction between a garden tractor and a lawn tractor?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The distinction between a garden tractor and a lawn tractor lies in their design and capabilities.

{"name": "Polyester", "documents": ["polyester, a class of synthetic polymers built up from multiple chemical repeating units linked together by ester (CO-O) groups. Polyesters display a wide array of properties and practical applications. Permanent-press fabrics, disposable soft-drink bottles, compact discs, rubber tires, and enamel paints represent only a few of the products made from this group.\nPolyesters most commonly are prepared from a condensation reaction between an organic alcohol (containing hydroxyl OH] groups) and a carboxylic acid (containing carboxyl [COOH] groups). These two functional groups react to form the characteristic ester linkage, a chemical group with the structure: ![Molecular structure.\nR and R′ represent the linked units that, repeated thousands of times within a single molecule, make up the long polymeric chain. The precise composition and structure of these repeating units vary widely, but roughly speaking they can be grouped into chains that are aliphatic (i.e., have an open structure) and those that contain ring-shaped molecular groups—particularly the large hydrocarbon aromatic groups.\nAmong the aliphatic group are the unsaturated polyesters, a class of resins that are molded into fibreglass-reinforced structures such as pleasure-boat hulls. Another aliphatic polyester is polyglycolic acid, a special type of degradable polymer that is made into bioabsorbable surgical sutures.\nRing-containing polyesters are the larger and commercially more important group. By far the most prominent member of this class is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a stiff, strong polymer that is spun into fibres known by such trademarks as Dacron and Terylene. PET is also extruded into the film known as Mylar and is blow-molded into disposable beverage bottles. A related polyester is polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). PBT is used in applications similar to those of PET, and it is also employed in a synthetic rubber known as copolyester elastomer.\nIn general, the more aromatic groups included in the repeating units, the stiffer and higher-melting the polymer. This rule can be illustrated by polycarbonate, a rigid, tough, crystal-clear resin from which compact discs are made, and the polyarylates, a class of engineering plastics that often take the place of metals in machine parts.\nAlkyd resins are oil-modified polyesters used in paints, varnishes, and other kinds of coating materials.", "# Polyester\nPolyester is a category of polymers that contain the ester functional group in every repeat unit of their main chain. As a specific material, it most commonly refers to a type called polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Polyesters include naturally occurring chemicals, such as in plants and insects, as well as synthetics such as polybutyrate. Natural polyesters and a few synthetic ones are biodegradable, but most synthetic polyesters are not. Synthetic polyesters are used extensively in clothing.\nPolyester fibers are sometimes spun together with natural fibers to produce a cloth with blended properties. Cotton-polyester blends can be strong, wrinkle- and tear-resistant, and reduce shrinking. Synthetic fibers using polyester have high water, wind and environmental resistance compared to plant-derived fibers. They are less fire-resistant and can melt when ignited.\nLiquid crystalline polyesters are among the first industrially used liquid crystal polymers. They are used for their mechanical properties and heat-resistance. These traits are also important in their application as an abradable seal in jet engines.\n## Types\nPolyesters are one of the most economically important classes of polymers, driven especially by PET, which is counted among the commodity plastics; in 2000 around 30 million tons were produced worldwide. There is great variety of structures and properties in the polyester family, based on the varying nature of the R group (see first figure with blue ester group).\n### Natural\nPolyesters occurring in nature include the cutin component of plant cuticles, which consists of omega hydroxy acids and their derivatives, interlinked via ester bonds, forming polyester polymers of indeterminate size. Polyesters are also produced by bees in the genus Colletes, which secrete a cellophane-like polyester lining for their underground brood cells earning them the nickname \"polyester bees\".\n### Synthetic\nThe family of synthetic polyesters comprises\nLinear aliphatic high molecular weight polyesters (Mn >10,000) are low-melting (m. p. 40 – 80 °C) semicrystalline polymers and exhibit relatively poor mechanical properties. Their inherent degradability, resulting from their hydrolytic instability, makes them suitable for applications where a possible environmental impact is a concern, e.g. packaging, disposable items or agricultural mulch films⁠ or in biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. Aliphatic linear low-molar-mass (Mn < 10,000) hydroxy-terminated polyesters are used as macromonomers for the production of polyurethanes. hyperbranched polyesters are used as rheology modifiers in thermoplastics or as crosslinkers in coatings due to their particularly low viscosity, good solubility and high functionality Aliphatic–aromatic polyesters, including poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), poly(hexamethylene terephthalate)(PHT), poly(propylene terephthalate) (PTT, Sorona), etc are high-melting semicrystalline materials (m. p. 160–280 °C) that and have found use as engineering thermoplastics, fibers and films. Wholly aromatic linear copolyesters present superior mechanical properties and heat resistance and are used in a number of high-performance applications. Unsaturated polyesters are produced from multifunctional alcohols and unsaturated dibasic acids and are cross-linked thereafter; they are used as matrices in composite materials. Alkyd resins are made from polyfunctional alcohols and fatty acids and are used widely in the coating and composite industries as they can be cross-linked in the presence of oxygen. Also rubber-like polyesters exist, called thermoplastic polyester elastomers (ester TPEs). Unsaturated polyesters (UPR) are thermosetting resins. They are used in the liquid state as casting materials, in sheet molding compounds, as fiberglass laminating resins and in non-metallic auto-body fillers. They are also used as the thermoset polymer matrix in pre-pregs. Fiberglass-reinforced unsaturated polyesters find wide application in bodies of yachts and as body parts of cars.\nDepending on the chemical structure, polyester can be a thermoplastic or thermoset. There are also polyester resins cured by hardeners; however, the most common polyesters are thermoplastics. The OH group is reacted with an Isocyanate functional compound in a 2 component system producing coatings which may optionally be pigmented. Polyesters as thermoplastics may change shape after the application of heat. While combustible at high temperatures, polyesters tend to shrink away from flames and self-extinguish upon ignition. Polyester fibers have high tenacity and E-modulus as well as low water absorption and minimal shrinkage in comparison with other industrial fibers.\nIncreasing the aromatic parts of polyesters increases their glass transition temperature, melting temperature, thermal stability, chemical stability, and solvent resistance.\nPolyesters can also be telechelic oligomers like the polycaprolactone diol (PCL) and the polyethylene adipate diol (PEA). They are then used as prepolymers.\n### Aliphatic vs. aromatic polymers\nThermally stable polymers, which generally have a high proportion of aromatic structures, are also called high-performance plastics. This application-oriented classification compares such polymers with engineering plastics and commodity plastics. The continuous service temperature of high-performance plastics is generally stated as being higher than 150 °C, whereas engineering plastics (such as polyamide or polycarbonate) are often defined as thermoplastics that retain their properties above 100 °C.⁠ Commodity plastics (such as polyethylene or polypropylene) have in this respect even greater limitations, but they are manufactured in great amounts at low cost.\nPoly(ester imides) contain an aromatic imide group in the repeat unit, the imide-based polymers have a high proportion of aromatic structures in the main chain and belong to the class of thermally stable polymers. Such polymers contain structures that impart high melting temperatures, resistance to oxidative degradation and stability to radiation and chemical reagents. Among the thermally stable polymers with commercial relevance are polyimides, polysulfones, polyetherketones, and polybenzimidazoles. Of these, polyimides are most widely applied. The polymers' structures result also in poor processing characteristics, in particular a high melting point and low solubility. The named properties are in particular based on a high percentage of aromatic carbons in the polymer backbone which produces a certain stiffness.⁠ Approaches for an improvement of processability include the incorporation of flexible spacers into the backbone, the attachment of stable pendent groups or the incorporation of non-symmetrical structures.⁠ Flexible spacers include, for example, ether or hexafluoroisopropylidene, carbonyl or aliphatic groups like isopropylidene; these groups allow bond rotation between aromatic rings. Less symmetrical structures, for example based on meta- or ortho-linked monomers introduce structural disorder and thereby decrease the crystallinity.\nThe generally poor processability of aromatic polymers (for example, a high melting point and a low solubility) also limits the available options for synthesis and may require strong electron-donating co-solvents like HFIP or TFA for analysis (e. g. 1H NMR spectroscopy) which themselves can introduce further practical limitations.\n## Uses and applications\nFabrics woven or knitted from polyester thread or yarn are used extensively in apparel and home furnishings, from shirts and pants to jackets and hats, bed sheets, blankets, upholstered furniture and computer mouse mats. Industrial polyester fibers, yarns and ropes are used in car tire reinforcements, fabrics for conveyor belts, safety belts, coated fabrics and plastic reinforcements with high-energy absorption. Polyester fiber is used as cushioning and insulating material in pillows, comforters and upholstery padding. Polyester fabrics are highly stain-resistant since polyester is a hydrophobic material, making it hard to absorb liquids. The only class of dyes which can be used to alter the color of polyester fabric are what are known as disperse dyes.\nPolyesters are also used to make bottles, films, tarpaulin, sails (Dacron), canoes, liquid crystal displays, holograms, filters, dielectric film for capacitors, film insulation for wire and insulating tapes. Polyesters are widely used as a finish on high-quality wood products such as guitars, pianos, and vehicle/yacht interiors. Thixotropic properties of spray-applicable polyesters make them ideal for use on open-grain timbers, as they can quickly fill wood grain, with a high-build film thickness per coat. It can be used for fashionable dresses, but it is most admired for its ability to resist wrinkling and shrinking while washing the product. Its toughness makes it a frequent choice for children's wear. Polyester is often blended with other fibres like cotton to get the desirable properties of both materials. Cured polyesters can be sanded and polished to a high-gloss, durable finish.\n## Production\n### Basics\nPolyethylene terephthalate, the polyester with the greatest market share, is a synthetic polymer made of purified terephthalic acid (PTA) or its dimethyl ester dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and monoethylene glycol (MEG). With 18% market share of all plastic materials produced, it ranges third after polyethylene (33.5%) and polypropylene (19.5%) and is counted as commodity plastic.\nThere are several reasons for the importance of polyethylene terephthalate:\nThe relatively easy accessible raw materials PTA or DMT and MEG The very well understood and described simple chemical process of its synthesis The low toxicity level of all raw materials and side products during production and processing The possibility to produce PET in a closed loop at low emissions to the environment The outstanding mechanical and chemical properties The recyclability The wide variety of intermediate and final products.\nIn the following table, the estimated world polyester production is shown. Main applications are textile polyester, bottle polyester resin, film polyester mainly for packaging and specialty polyesters for engineering plastics. According to this table, the world's total polyester production might exceed 50 million tons per annum before the year 2010.\n### Polyester processing\nAfter the first stage of polymer production in the melt phase, the product stream divides into two different application areas which are mainly textile applications and packaging applications. In the following table, the main applications of textile and packaging of polyester are listed.\nAbbreviations:\nA comparable small market segment (much less than 1 million tonnes/year) of polyester is used to produce engineering plastics and masterbatch.\nIn order to produce the polyester melt with a high efficiency, high-output processing steps like staple fiber (50–300 tonnes/day per spinning line) or POY /FDY (up to 600 tonnes/day split into about 10 spinning machines) are meanwhile more and more vertically integrated direct processes. This means the polymer melt is directly converted into the textile fibers or filaments without the common step of pelletizing. We are talking about full vertical integration when polyester is produced at one site starting from crude oil or distillation products in the chain oil → benzene → PX → PTA → PET melt → fiber/filament or bottle-grade resin. Such integrated processes are meanwhile established in more or less interrupted processes at one production site. Eastman Chemicals were the first to introduce the idea of closing the chain from PX to PET resin with their so-called INTEGREX process. The capacity of such vertically integrated production sites is >1000 tonnes/day and can easily reach 2500 tonnes/day.\nBesides the above-mentioned large processing units to produce staple fiber or yarns, there are ten thousands of small and very small processing plants, so that one can estimate that polyester is processed and recycled in more than 10 000 plants around the globe. This is without counting all the companies involved in the supply industry, beginning with engineering and processing machines and ending with special additives, stabilizers and colors. This is a gigantic industry complex and it is still growing by 4–8% per year, depending on the world region.\n## Synthesis\nSynthesis of polyesters is generally achieved by a polycondensation reaction. The general equation for the reaction of a diol with a diacid is:\nPolyesters can be obtained by a wide range of reactions of which the most important are the reaction of acids and alcohols, alcoholysis and or acidolysis of low-molecular weight esters or the alcoholysis of acyl chlorides. The following figure gives an overview over such typical polycondensation reactions for polyester production. Furthermore, polyesters are accessible via ring-opening polymerization.\nAzeotrope esterification is a classical method for condensation. The water formed by the reaction of alcohol and a carboxylic acid is continually removed by azeotrope distillation. When melting points of the monomers are sufficiently low, a polyester can be formed via direct esterification while removing the reaction water via vacuum.\nDirect bulk polyesterification at high temperatures (150 – 290 °C) is well-suited and used on the industrial scale for the production of aliphatic polyesters, unsaturated polyesters, and aromatic–aliphatic polyesters. Monomers containing phenolic or tertiary hydroxyl groups exhibit a low reactivity with carboxylic acids and cannot be polymerized via direct acid alcohol-based polyesterification.⁠ In the case of PET production, however, the direct process has several advantages, in particular a higher reaction rate, a higher attainable molecular weight, the release of water instead of methanol and lower storage costs of the acid when compared to the ester due to the lower weight.\n### Alcoholic transesterification\nTransesterification: An alcohol-terminated oligomer and an ester-terminated oligomer condense to form an ester linkage, with loss of an alcohol. R and R' are the two oligomer chains, R'' is a sacrificial unit such as a methyl group (methanol is the byproduct of the esterification reaction).\nThe term \"transesterification\" is typically used to describe hydroxy–ester, carboxy–ester, and ester–ester exchange reactions. The hydroxy–ester exchange reaction possesses the highest rate of reaction and is used for the production of numerous aromatic–aliphatic and wholly aromatic polyesters. The transesterification based synthesis is particularly useful for when high melting and poorly soluble dicarboxylic acids are used. In addition, alcohols as condensation product are more volatile and thereby easier to remove than water.\nThe high-temperature melt synthesis between bisphenol diacetates and aromatic dicarboxylic acids or in reverse between bisphenols and aromatic dicarboxylic acid diphenyl esters (carried out at 220 to 320 °C upon the release of acetic acid) is, besides the acyl chloride based synthesis, the preferred route to wholly aromatic polyesters.\n### Acylation\nIn acylation, the acid begins as an acid chloride, and thus the polycondensation proceeds with emission of hydrochloric acid (HCl) instead of water.\nThe reaction between diacyl chlorides and alcohols or phenolic compounds has been widely applied to polyester synthesis and has been subject of numerous reviews and book chapters.⁠ The reaction is carried out at lower temperatures than the equilibrium methods; possible types are the high-temperature solution condensation, amine catalysed and interfacial reactions. In addition, the use of activating agents is counted as non-equilibrium method. The equilibrium constants for the acyl chloride-based condensation yielding yielding arylates and polyarylates are very high indeed and are reported to be 4.3 × 103 and 4.7 × 103, respectively. This reaction is thus often referred to as a 'non-equilibrium' polyesterification. Even though the acyl chloride based synthesis is also subject of reports in the patent literature, it is unlikely that the reaction is utilized on the production scale. The method is limited by the acid dichlorides' high cost, its sensitivity to hydrolysis and the occurrence of side reactions.\nThe high temperature reaction (100 to > 300 °C) of an diacyl chloride with an dialcohol yields the polyester and hydrogen chloride. Under these relatively high temperatures the reaction proceeds rapidly without a catalyst:\nThe conversion of the reaction can be followed by titration of the evolved hydrogen chloride. A wide variety of solvents has been described including chlorinated benzenes (e.g. dichlorobenzene), chlorinated naphthalenes or diphenyls, as well as non-chlorinated aromatics like terphenyls, benzophenones or dibenzylbenzenes. The reaction was also applied successfully to the preparation of highly crystalline and poorly soluble polymers which require high temperatures to be kept in solution (at least until a sufficiently high molecular weight was achieved).\nIn an interfacial acyl chloride-based reaction, the alcohol (generally in fact a phenol) is dissolved in the form of an alkoxide in an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, the acyl chloride in an organic solvent immiscible with water such as dichloromethane, chlorobenzene or hexane, the reaction occurs at the interface under high-speed agitation near room temperature.\nThe procedure is used for the production of polyarylates (polyesters based on bisphenols), polyamides, polycarbonates, poly(thiocarbonate)s, and others. Since the molecular weight of the product obtained by a high-temperature synthesis can be seriously limited by side reactions, this problem is circumvented by the mild temperatures of interfacial polycondensation. The procedure is applied to the commercial production of bisphenol-A-based polyarylates like Unitika's U-Polymer. Water could be in some cases replaced by an immiscible organic solvent (e. g. in the adiponitrile/carbon tetrachloride system). The procedure is of little use in the production of polyesters based on aliphatic diols which have higher pKa values than phenols and therefore do not form alcoholate ions in aqueous solutions. The base catalysed reaction of an acyl chloride with an alcohol may also be carried out in one phase using tertiary amines (e. g. triethylamine, Et3N) or pyridine as acid acceptors:\nWhile acyl chloride-based polyesterifications proceed only very slowly at room temperature without a catalyst, the amine accelerates the reaction in several possible ways, although the mechanism is not fully understood. However, it is known that tertiary amines can cause side-reactions such as the formation of ketenes and ketene dimers.⁠\n### Ring-opening polymerization\nAliphatic polyesters can be assembled from lactones under very mild conditions, catalyzed anionically, cationically, metallorganically or enzyme-based. A number of catalytic methods for the copolymerization of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides have also recently been shown to provide a wide array of functionalized polyesters, both saturated and unsaturated. Ring-opening polymerization of lactones and lactides is also applied on the industrial scale.\n### Other methods\nNumerous other reactions have been reported for the synthesis of selected polyesters, but are limited to laboratory-scale syntheses using specific conditions, for example using dicarboxylic acid salts and dialkyl halides or reactions between bisketenes and diols.\nInstead of acyl chlorides, so-called activating agents can be used, such as 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or trifluoroacetic anhydride. The polycondensation proceeds via the in situ conversion of the carboxylic acid into a more reactive intermediate while the activating agents are consumed. The reaction proceeds, for example, via an intermediate N-acylimidazole which reacts with catalytically acting sodium alkoxide:\nThe use of activating agents for the production of high-melting aromatic polyesters and polyamides under mild conditions has been subject of intensive academic research since the 1980s, but the reactions have not gained commercial acceptance as similar results can be achieved with cheaper reactants.\n### Thermodynamics of polycondensation reactions\nPolyesterifications are grouped by some authors into two main categories: a) equilibrium polyesterifications (mainly alcohol-acid reaction, alcohol–ester and acid–ester interchange reactions, carried out in bulk at high temperatures), and b) non-equilibrium polyesterifications, using highly reactive monomers (for example acid chlorides or activated carboxylic acids, mostly carried out at lower temperatures in solution).\nThe acid-alcohol based polyesterification is one example of an equilibrium reaction. The ratio between the polymer-forming ester group (-C(O)O-) and the condensation product water (H2O) against the acid-based (-C(O)OH) and alcohol-based (-OH) monomers is described by the equilibrium constant KC.\nK C =     {\\displaystyle K_{C}={\\frac {}{}}}\nThe equilibrium constant of the acid-alcohol based polyesterification is typically KC ≤ 10, what is not high enough to obtain high-molecular weight polymers (DPn ≥ 100), as the number average degree of polymerization (DPn) can be calculated from the equilibrium constant KC.\nD P n   =   K C 2 + 1 {\\displaystyle DP_{n}~=~{\\sqrt{K_{C}}}+1}\nIn equilibrium reactions, it is therefore necessary to remove the condensation product continuously and efficiently from the reaction medium in order to drive the equilibrium towards polymer. The condensation product is therefore removed at reduced pressure and high temperatures (150–320 °C, depending on the monomers) to prevent the back reaction. With the progress of the reaction, the concentration of active chain ends is decreasing and the viscosity of the melt or solution increasing. For an increase of the reaction rate, the reaction is carried out at high end group concentration (preferably in the bulk), promoted by the elevated temperatures.\nEquilibrium constants of magnitude KC ≥ 104 are achieved when using reactive reactants (acid chlorides or acid anhydrides) or activating agents like 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole. Using these reactants, molecular weights required for technical applications can be achieved even without active removal of the condensation product.\n## History\nIn 1926, United States-based E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. began research on large molecules and synthetic fibers. This early research, headed by W.H. Carothers, centered on what became nylon, which was one of the first synthetic fibers. Carothers was working for duPont at the time. Carothers' research was incomplete and had not advanced to investigating the polyester formed from mixing ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid. In 1928 polyester was patented in Britain by the International General Electric company. Carothers' project was revived by British scientists Whinfield and Dickson, who patented polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or PETE in 1941. Polyethylene terephthalate forms the basis for synthetic fibers like Dacron, Terylene and polyester. In 1946, duPont bought all legal rights from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI).\n## Biodegradation and environmental concerns\nThe Futuro houses were made of fibreglass-reinforced polyester plastic; polyester-polyurethane, and poly(methyl methacrylate). One house was found to be degrading by cyanobacteria and Archaea.\n### Cross-linking\nUnsaturated polyesters are thermosetting polymers. They are generally copolymers prepared by polymerizing one or more diols with saturated and unsaturated dicarboxylic acids (maleic acid, fumaric acid, etc.) or their anhydrides. The double bond of unsaturated polyesters reacts with a vinyl monomer, usually styrene, resulting in a 3-D cross-linked structure. This structure acts as a thermoset. The exothermic cross-linking reaction is initiated through a catalyst, usually an organic peroxide such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxide or benzoyl peroxide.\n### Pollution of freshwater and seawater habitats\nA team at Plymouth University in the UK spent 12 months analysing what happened when a number of synthetic materials were washed at different temperatures in domestic washing machines, using different combinations of detergents, to quantify the microfibres shed. They found that an average washing load of 6 kg could release an estimated 137,951 fibres from polyester-cotton blend fabric, 496,030 fibres from polyester and 728,789 from acrylic. Those fibers add to the general microplastics pollution.\n## Recycling\nRecycling of polymers has become very important as the production and use of plastic is continuously rising.

{"name": "Fraunhofer lines", "documents": ["# Fraunhofer lines\nIn physics and optics, the Fraunhofer lines are a set of spectral absorption lines named after the German physicist Joseph von Fraunhofer (1787–1826). The lines were originally observed as dark features (absorption lines) in the optical spectrum of the Sun (white light) .\n## Discovery\nIn 1802, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston was the first person to note the appearance of a number of dark features in the solar spectrum. In 1814, Fraunhofer independently rediscovered the lines and began to systematically study and measure the wavelengths where these features are observed. He mapped over 570 lines, designating the principal features (lines) with the letters A through K and weaker lines with other letters. Modern observations of sunlight can detect many thousands of lines.\nAbout 45 years later, Kirchhoff and Bunsen noticed that several Fraunhofer lines coincide with characteristic emission lines identified in the spectra of heated elements. It was correctly deduced that dark lines in the solar spectrum are caused by absorption by chemical elements in the solar atmosphere. Some of the observed features were identified as telluric lines originating from absorption by oxygen molecules in the Earth's atmosphere.\n## Sources\nThe Fraunhofer lines are typical spectral absorption lines. Absorption lines are dark lines, narrow regions of decreased intensity, that are the result of photons being absorbed as light passes from the source to the detector. In the Sun, Fraunhofer lines are a result of gas in the photosphere, the outer region of the sun. The photosphere gas has lower temperatures than gas in the inner regions, and absorbs a little of the light emitted from those regions.\n## Naming\nThe major Fraunhofer lines, and the elements they are associated with, are shown in the following table:\nThe Fraunhofer C, F, G', and h lines correspond to the alpha, beta, gamma and delta lines of the Balmer series of emission lines of the hydrogen atom. The Fraunhofer letters are now rarely used for those lines.\nThe D1 and D2 lines form the well-known \"sodium doublet\", the centre wavelength of which (589.29 nm) is given the designation letter \"D\". This historical designation for this line has stuck and is given to all the transitions between the ground state and the first excited state of the other alkali atoms as well. The D1 and D2 lines correspond to the fine-structure splitting of the excited states. This may be confusing because the excited state for this transition is the P-state of the alkali and should not be confused with the higher D-states.\nThe Fraunhofer H and K letters are also still used for the calcium-II doublet in the violet part of the spectrum, important in astronomical spectroscopy.\nNote that there is disagreement in the literature for some line designations; e.g., the Fraunhofer d-line may refer to the cyan iron line at 466.814 nm, or alternatively to the yellow helium line (also labeled D3) at 587.5618 nm. Similarly, there is ambiguity with reference to the e-line, since it can refer to the spectral lines of both iron (Fe) and mercury (Hg). In order to resolve ambiguities that arise in usage, ambiguous Fraunhofer line designations are preceded by the element with which they are associated (e.g., Mercury e-line and Helium d-line).\nBecause of their well-defined wavelengths, Fraunhofer lines are often used to characterize the refractive index and dispersion properties of optical materials.", "Fraunhofer lines, in astronomical spectroscopy, any of the dark (absorption) lines in the spectrum of the Sun or other star, caused by selective absorption of the Sun’s or star’s radiation at specific wavelengths by the various elements existing as gases in its atmosphere.

{"name": "Psychosis", "documents": ["psychosis, plural psychoses, any of several major mental illnesses that can cause delusions, hallucinations, serious defects in judgment and other cognitive processes, and the inability to evaluate reality objectively. A brief treatment of psychosis follows. For full treatment, see mental disorder.\nThe term psychosis is derived from the Greek psyche, meaning “soul,” “mind,” or “breath.” The ancient Greeks believed that the breath was the animating force of life and that when the breath left the body, as happened in death, the soul left the body. Because words that contain the root psyche (e.g., psychiatrist, psychiatry, etc.) are associated with the essence of life (usually related to the soul or human spirit) psychosis has come to mean that a person has lost the essence of life—that he or she has developed a private view of the world or a private reality not shared by others.\nIt is difficult to clearly demarcate psychoses from the class of less-severe mental disorders known as psychoneuroses (commonly called neuroses) because a neurosis may be so severe, disabling, or disorganizing in its effects that it actually constitutes a psychosis. However, in general, patients suffering from the recognized psychotic illnesses exhibit a disturbed sense of reality and a disorganization of personality that sets them apart from neurotics. Such patients also frequently believe that nothing is wrong with them, despite the palpable evidence to the contrary as evinced by their confused or bizarre behaviour. Psychotics may require hospitalization because they cannot take care of themselves or because they may constitute a danger to themselves or to others.\nThe major defining symptoms of psychosis are hallucinations and delusions. A hallucination is a sensory perception experienced only by the affected person; it is not shared by others. For example, persons experiencing hallucinations may hear a voice telling them to commit suicide or to cut themselves, but no one else can hear this voice. A delusion is a belief not credible to others. The belief expressed by the affected person usually has little basis in the person’s past. For example, a casually religious person who is experiencing a psychosis may suddenly begin to tell other people that he is Christ, Muhammad, or Buddha or that he has been selected by God for some special task. There is no evidence that would make anyone else share this belief. A person can experience both hallucinations and delusions or just one or the other. Hallucinations and delusions are most often caused by a disturbance or change in brain function.\nPsychoses may be divided into two categories: organic and functional. Organic psychoses are characterized by abnormal brain function that is caused by a known physical abnormality, which in most cases is some organic disease of the brain. However, altered brain function that precipitates hallucinations and delusions is more often associated with specific psychiatric disorders, which are categorized as functional psychoses.\n## Functional psychoses\nSchizophrenia is the most common and the most potentially severe and disabling of the psychoses. Symptoms of schizophrenia typically first manifest themselves during the teen years or early adult life. The primary symptoms are the presence of hallucinations and delusions, disorganized speech and behaviour, a lack of emotional expression, and a marked lack of energy. In order for a definitive diagnosis of schizophrenia to be made, these symptoms must be present for at least six months and must impair the person’s ability to function. The course of the disease is variable. Some schizophrenics suffer one acute episode and then permanently recover; others suffer from repeated episodes with periods of remission in between; and still others become chronically psychotic and must be permanently hospitalized.\nDespite prolonged research, the cause or causes of schizophrenia remain largely unknown. It is clear that there is an inherited genetic predisposition to the disease. Thus, the children of schizophrenic parents stand a greatly increased chance of themselves becoming schizophrenic. While no causative link has been identified, many neurological findings have been noted in the examination of schizophrenic patients. These include subtle problems with coordination, changes in brain structure such as enlarged cerebral ventricles, and abnormal electrical signaling in the brain. In addition, the levels of several neurotransmitters (chemicals that facilitate the transmission of nerve impulses), particularly dopamine and glutamate, are altered in the brains of schizophrenic individuals.\nThe symptoms of schizophrenia can be treated, but not cured, with such antipsychotic drugs as chlorpromazine and other phenothiazine drugs and by haloperidol. These medications affect neurotransmission in the brain. For example, haloperidol has strong antidopaminergic actions that facilitate the regulation of dopamine activity and thus reduce certain symptoms of schizophrenia. Psychotherapy may be useful in alleviating distress and helping the patient to cope with the effects of the illness.\nOther functional psychoses include mood disorders, which are also known as affective disorders. Examples include bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. Mood disorders are characterized by states of extreme and prolonged depression, extreme mania, or alternating cycles of both of these mood abnormalities. Depression is a sad, hopeless, pessimistic feeling that can cause listlessness; loss of pleasure in one’s surroundings, loved ones, and activities; fatigue; slowness of thought and action; insomnia; and reduced appetite. Mania is a state of undue and prolonged excitement that is evinced by accelerated, loud, and voluble speech; heightened enthusiasm, confidence, and optimism; rapid and disconnected ideas and associations; rapid or continuous motor activity; impulsive, gregarious, and overbearing behaviour; heightened irritability; and a reduced need for sleep. When depression and mania alternate cyclically or otherwise appear at different times in the same patient, the person is termed to be suffering from bipolar disorder. Bipolar patients also frequently suffer from delusions, hallucinations, or other overtly psychotic symptoms. Bipolar disorder often first manifests itself around age 30, and the disease is often chronic. Many bipolar patients can be treated by long-term maintenance on lithium carbonate, which reduces and prevents the attacks of mania and depression. However, the suicide rate associated with severe bipolar disorder is high, ranging from an estimated 5 to 15 percent of patients.\nDepression alone can be psychotic if it is severe and disabling enough, and particularly if it is accompanied by delusions, hallucinations, or paranoia. Mania and many cases of depression are believed to be caused by deficiencies or excesses of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, particularly norepinephrine and serotonin. Therefore, antidepressant drugs that act to reestablish normal norepinephrine and serotonin levels are often effective for bipolar and major depressive disorders. Treatment often involves the administration of a tricyclic antidepressant (e.g., amitriptyline, amoxapine, or imipramine) or an agent from a class of antidepressants known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine, tranylcypromine, or selegiline). Shock (electroconvulsive) therapy is useful in some cases, and psychotherapy and behavioral therapy may also be effective.\nParanoia is a special syndrome that can be a feature of schizophrenia (paranoid schizophrenia) and bipolar disorder or that can exist by itself. A person suffering from paranoia thinks or believes that other people are plotting against or trying to harm, harass, or persecute him in some way. The paranoiac exaggerates trivial incidents in everyday life into menacing or threatening situations and cannot rid himself of suspicions and apprehensions. Paranoid syndromes can sometimes be treated or alleviated by antipsychotic drugs.\nThe functional psychoses are difficult to treat; drug treatments are the most common and successful approach. Psychoanalysis and other psychotherapies, which are based on developing a patient’s insight into his or her presumed underlying emotional conflicts, are difficult to apply to psychotic patients.\n## Organic psychoses\nMany medical conditions can affect brain function and cause symptoms of hallucinations and delusions. For example, dementia is the gradual and progressive loss of intellectual abilities, such as remembering, thinking, paying attention, and perceiving; it is often a chronic condition. Delirium, which commonly occurs in patients with dementia, is a clouded, confused state of consciousness and is usually only a temporary condition. Dementia is the principal syndrome in the most common and widespread organic psychosis, Alzheimer disease. An elderly person with this disease experiences chronic confusion and loss of memory and may experience paranoia or other personality changes. The memory loss becomes increasingly far-reaching, and the patient gradually becomes lethargic and inactive; death is the end result. The course of the disease may last from 2 to 20 years. Disturbances in the blood supply to the brain caused by cerebral arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) produce symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer disease. Other medical conditions associated with psychoses include thyroid disease, vitamin deficiencies, liver disease, epilepsy, Parkinson disease, and encephalitis. Disorders of sleep or prolonged sensory deprivation can also cause hallucinations and delusions.\nMany drugs can alter brain function and cause symptoms of psychoses. For example, certain drugs—such as narcotics to treat pain, levodopa for Parkinson disease, prednisone for inflammation, and digitalis for heart conditions—can give rise to hallucinations and delusions. Perhaps the greatest cause of these symptoms in otherwise healthy individuals is drugs of abuse, such as alcohol, cocaine, and hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide], PCP [phencyclidine], and Ecstasy [3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine]). Chronic alcoholics often exhibit psychotic symptoms. Alcohol-induced brain damage can also result in memory defects and a major decline in intellectual abilities and social skills (see alcoholism).\n[Gary J. Tucker](/contributor/Gary-J-Tucker/5620)", "# Psychosis\nPsychosis is an abnormal condition of the mind that results in difficulties determining what is real and what is not real. Symptoms may include delusions and hallucinations, among other features. Additional symptoms are incoherent speech and behavior that is inappropriate for a given situation. There may also be sleep problems, social withdrawal, lack of motivation, and difficulties carrying out daily activities. Psychosis can have serious adverse outcomes.\nAs with many psychiatric phenomena, psychosis has several different causes. These include mental illness, such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, sensory deprivation and in rare cases, major depression (psychotic depression). Other causes include: trauma, sleep deprivation, some medical conditions, certain medications, and drugs such as cannabis, hallucinogens, and stimulants. One type, known as postpartum psychosis, can occur after giving birth. The neurotransmitter dopamine is believed to play an important role. Acute psychosis is considered primary if it results from a psychiatric condition and secondary if it is caused by a medical condition or drugs. The diagnosis of a mental health condition requires excluding other potential causes. Testing may be done to check for central nervous system diseases, toxins, or other health problems as a cause.\nTreatment may include antipsychotic medication, psychotherapy, and social support. Early treatment appears to improve outcomes. Medications appear to have a moderate effect. Outcomes depend on the underlying cause. In the United States about 3% of people develop psychosis at some point in their lives. The condition has been described since at least the 4th century BCE by Hippocrates and possibly as early as 1500 BCE in the Egyptian Ebers Papyrus.\n## Signs and symptoms\n### Hallucinations\nA hallucination is defined as sensory perception in the absence of external stimuli. Hallucinations are different from illusions and perceptual distortions, which are the misperception of external stimuli. Hallucinations may occur in any of the senses and take on almost any form. They may consist of simple sensations (such as lights, colors, sounds, tastes, or smells) or more detailed experiences (such as seeing and interacting with animals and people, hearing voices, and having complex tactile sensations). Hallucinations are generally characterized as being vivid and uncontrollable. Auditory hallucinations, particularly experiences of hearing voices, are the most common and often prominent feature of psychosis.\nUp to 15% of the general population may experience auditory hallucinations (though not all are due to psychosis). The prevalence of auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia is generally put around 70%, but may go as high as 98%. Reported prevalence in bipolar disorder ranges between 11% and 68%. During the early 20th century, auditory hallucinations were second to visual hallucinations in frequency, but they are now the most common manifestation of schizophrenia, although rates vary between cultures and regions. Auditory hallucinations are most commonly intelligible voices. When voices are present, the average number has been estimated at three. Content, like frequency, differs significantly, especially across cultures and demographics. People who experience auditory hallucinations can frequently identify the loudness, location of origin, and may settle on identities for voices. Western cultures are associated with auditory experiences concerning religious content, frequently related to sin. Hallucinations may command a person to do something potentially dangerous when combined with delusions.\nSo-called \"minor hallucinations\", such as extracampine hallucinations, or false perceptions of people or movement occurring outside of one's visual field, frequently occur in neurocognitive disorders, such as Parkinson's disease.\nVisual hallucinations occur in roughly a third of people with schizophrenia, although rates as high as 55% are reported. The prevalence in bipolar disorder is around 15%. Content commonly involves animate objects, although perceptual abnormalities such as changes in lighting, shading, streaks, or lines may be seen. Visual abnormalities may conflict with proprioceptive information, and visions may include experiences such as the ground tilting. Lilliputian hallucinations are less common in schizophrenia, and are more common in various types of encephalopathy, such as peduncular hallucinosis.\nA visceral hallucination, also called a cenesthetic hallucination, is characterized by visceral sensations in the absence of stimuli. Cenesthetic hallucinations may include sensations of burning, or re-arrangement of internal organs.\n### Delusions\nPsychosis may involve delusional beliefs. A delusion is a fixed, false idiosyncratic belief, which does not change even when presented with incontrovertible evidence to the contrary. Delusions are context- and culture-dependent: a belief which inhibits critical functioning and is widely considered delusional in one population may be common (and even adaptive) in another, or in the same population at a later time. Since normative views may contradict available evidence, a belief need not contravene cultural standards in order to be considered delusional.\nPrevalence in schizophrenia is generally considered at least 90%, and around 50% in bipolar disorder.\nThe DSM-5 characterizes certain delusions as \"bizarre\" if they are clearly implausible, or are incompatible with the surrounding cultural context. The concept of bizarre delusions has many criticisms, the most prominent being judging its presence is not highly reliable even among trained individuals.\nA delusion may involve diverse thematic content. The most common type is a persecutory delusion, in which a person believes that an entity seeks to harm them. Others include delusions of reference (the belief that some element of one's experience represents a deliberate and specific act by or message from some other entity), delusions of grandeur (the belief that one possesses special power or influence beyond one's actual limits), thought broadcasting (the belief that one's thoughts are audible) and thought insertion (the belief that one's thoughts are not one's own). A delusion may also involve misidentification of objects, persons, or environs that the afflicted should reasonably be able to recognize; such examples include Cotard's syndrome (the belief that oneself is partly or wholly dead) and clinical lycanthropy (the belief that oneself is or has transformed into an animal).\nThe subject matter of delusions seems to reflect the current culture in a particular time and location. For example, in the US, during the early 1900s syphilis was a common topic, during the second world war Germany, during the cold war communists, and in recent years technology has been a focus. Some psychologists, such as those who practice the Open Dialogue method, believe that the content of psychosis represents an underlying thought process that may, in part, be responsible for psychosis, though the accepted medical position is that psychosis is due to a brain disorder.\nHistorically, Karl Jaspers classified psychotic delusions into primary and secondary types. Primary delusions are defined as arising suddenly and not being comprehensible in terms of normal mental processes, whereas secondary delusions are typically understood as being influenced by the person's background or current situation (e.g., ethnicity; also religious, superstitious, or political beliefs).\n### Disorganization of speech/thought or behavior\nDisorganization is split into disorganized speech (or thought), and grossly disorganized motor behavior. Disorganized speech or thought, also called formal thought disorder, is disorganization of thinking that is inferred from speech. Characteristics of disorganized speech include rapidly switching topics, called derailment or loose association; switching to topics that are unrelated, called tangential thinking; incomprehensible speech, called word salad or incoherence. Disorganized motor behavior includes repetitive, odd, or sometimes purposeless movement. Disorganized motor behavior rarely includes catatonia, and although it was a historically prominent symptom, it is rarely seen today. Whether this is due to historically used treatments or the lack thereof is unknown.\nCatatonia describes a profoundly agitated state in which the experience of reality is generally considered impaired. There are two primary manifestations of catatonic behavior. The classic presentation is a person who does not move or interact with the world in any way while awake. This type of catatonia presents with waxy flexibility. Waxy flexibility is when someone physically moves part of a catatonic person's body and the person stays in the position even if it is bizarre and otherwise nonfunctional (such as moving a person's arm straight up in the air and the arm staying there).\nThe other type of catatonia is more of an outward presentation of the profoundly agitated state described above. It involves excessive and purposeless motor behaviour, as well as an extreme mental preoccupation that prevents an intact experience of reality. An example is someone walking very fast in circles to the exclusion of anything else with a level of mental preoccupation (meaning not focused on anything relevant to the situation) that was not typical of the person prior to the symptom onset. In both types of catatonia, there is generally no reaction to anything that happens outside of them. It is important to distinguish catatonic agitation from severe bipolar mania, although someone could have both.\n### Negative symptoms\nNegative symptoms include reduced emotional expression (flat affect), decreased motivation (avolition), and reduced spontaneous speech (poverty of speech, alogia). Individuals with this condition lack interest and spontaneity, and have the inability to feel pleasure (anhedonia).\n### Psychosis in adolescents\nPsychosis is rare in adolescents. Young people who have psychosis may have trouble connecting with the world around them and may experience hallucinations and/or delusions. Adolescents with psychosis may also have cognitive deficits that may make it harder for the youth to socialize and work. Potential impairments include the speed of mental processing, ability to focus without getting distracted (limited attention span), and deficits in verbal memory. If an adolescent is experiencing psychosis, they most likely have comorbidity meaning they could have multiple mental illnesses. Because of this, it can be difficult to determine if it is psychosis or autism spectrum disorder, social or generalized anxiety disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n## History\n### Etymology\nThe word psychosis was introduced to the psychiatric literature in 1841 by Karl Friedrich Canstatt in his work Handbuch der Medizinischen Klinik. He used it as a shorthand for 'psychic neurosis'. At that time neurosis meant any disease of the nervous system, and Canstatt was thus referring to what was considered a psychological manifestation of brain disease. Ernst von Feuchtersleben is also widely credited as introducing the term in 1845, as an alternative to insanity and mania.\nThe term stems from Modern Latin psychosis, \"a giving soul or life to, animating, quickening\" and that from Ancient Greek ψυχή (psyche), \"soul\" and the suffix -ωσις (-osis), in this case \"abnormal condition\".\nIn its adjective form \"psychotic\", references to psychosis can be found in both clinical and non-clinical discussions. However, in a non-clinical context, \"psychotic\" is a nonspecific colloquialism used to mean \"insane\".\n### Classification\nThe word was also used to distinguish a condition considered a disorder of the mind, as opposed to neurosis, which was considered a disorder of the nervous system. The psychoses thus became the modern equivalent of the old notion of madness, and hence there was much debate on whether there was only one (unitary) or many forms of the new disease. One type of broad usage would later be narrowed down by Koch in 1891 to the 'psychopathic inferiorities'—later renamed abnormal personalities by Schneider.\nThe division of the major psychoses into manic depressive illness (now called bipolar disorder) and dementia praecox (now called schizophrenia) was made by Emil Kraepelin, who attempted to create a synthesis of the various mental disorders identified by 19th-century psychiatrists, by grouping diseases together based on classification of common symptoms. Kraepelin used the term 'manic depressive insanity' to describe the whole spectrum of mood disorders, in a far wider sense than it is usually used today.\nIn Kraepelin's classification this would include 'unipolar' clinical depression, as well as bipolar disorder and other mood disorders such as cyclothymia. These are characterised by problems with mood control and the psychotic episodes appear associated with disturbances in mood, and patients often have periods of normal functioning between psychotic episodes even without medication. Schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic episodes that appear unrelated to disturbances in mood, and most non-medicated patients show signs of disturbance between psychotic episodes.\n### Treatment\nEarly civilizations considered madness a supernaturally inflicted phenomenon. Archaeologists have unearthed skulls with clearly visible drillings, some datable back to 5000 BC suggesting that trepanning was a common treatment for psychosis in ancient times. Written record of supernatural causes and resultant treatments can be traced back to the New Testament. Mark 5:8–13 describes a man displaying what would today be described as psychotic symptoms. Christ cured this \"demonic madness\" by casting out the demons and hurling them into a herd of swine. Exorcism is still utilized in some religious circles as a treatment for psychosis presumed to be demonic possession. A research study of out-patients in psychiatric clinics found that 30 percent of religious patients attributed the cause of their psychotic symptoms to evil spirits. Many of these patients underwent exorcistic healing rituals that, though largely regarded as positive experiences by the patients, had no effect on symptomology. Results did, however, show a significant worsening of psychotic symptoms associated with exclusion of medical treatment for coercive forms of exorcism.\nThe medical teachings of the fourth-century philosopher and physician Hippocrates of Cos proposed a natural, rather than supernatural, cause of human illness. In Hippocrates' work, the Hippocratic corpus, a holistic explanation for health and disease was developed to include madness and other \"diseases of the mind.\" Hippocrates writes:\nMen ought to know that from the brain, and from the brain only, arise our pleasures, joys, laughter, and jests, as well as our sorrows, pains, griefs and tears. Through it, in particular, we think, see, hear, and distinguish the ugly from the beautiful, the bad from the good, the pleasant from the unpleasant…. It is the same thing which makes us mad or delirious, inspires us with dread and fear, whether by night or by day, brings sleeplessness, inopportune mistakes, aimless anxieties, absentmindedness, and acts that are contrary to habit.\nHippocrates espoused a theory of humoralism wherein disease is resultant of a shifting balance in bodily fluids including blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. According to humoralism, each fluid or \"humour\" has temperamental or behavioral correlates. In the case of psychosis, symptoms are thought to be caused by an excess of both blood and yellow bile. Thus, the proposed surgical intervention for psychotic or manic behavior was bloodletting.\n18th-century physician, educator, and widely considered \"founder of American psychiatry\", Benjamin Rush, also prescribed bloodletting as a first-line treatment for psychosis. Although not a proponent of humoralism, Rush believed that active purging and bloodletting were efficacious corrections for disruptions in the circulatory system, a complication he believed was the primary cause of \"insanity\". Although Rush's treatment modalities are now considered antiquated and brutish, his contributions to psychiatry, namely the biological underpinnings of psychiatric phenomenon including psychosis, have been invaluable to the field. In honor of such contributions, Benjamin Rush's image is in the official seal of the American Psychiatric Association.\nEarly 20th-century treatments for severe and persisting psychosis were characterized by an emphasis on shocking the nervous system. Such therapies include insulin shock therapy, cardiazol shock therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy. Despite considerable risk, shock therapy was considered highly efficacious in the treatment of psychosis including schizophrenia. The acceptance of high-risk treatments led to more invasive medical interventions including psychosurgery.\nIn 1888, Swiss psychiatrist Gottlieb Burckhardt performed the first medically sanctioned psychosurgery in which the cerebral cortex was excised. Although some patients showed improvement of symptoms and became more subdued, one patient died and several developed aphasia or seizure disorders. Burckhardt would go on to publish his clinical outcomes in a scholarly paper. This procedure was met with criticism from the medical community and his academic and surgical endeavors were largely ignored. In the late 1930s, Egas Moniz conceived the leucotomy (AKA prefrontal lobotomy) in which the fibers connecting the frontal lobes to the rest of the brain were severed. Moniz's primary inspiration stemmed from a demonstration by neuroscientists John Fulton and Carlyle's 1935 experiment in which two chimpanzees were given leucotomies and pre- and post-surgical behavior was compared. Prior to the leucotomy, the chimps engaged in typical behavior including throwing feces and fighting. After the procedure, both chimps were pacified and less violent. During the Q&A, Moniz asked if such a procedure could be extended to human subjects, a question that Fulton admitted was quite startling. Moniz would go on to extend the controversial practice to humans with various psychotic disorders, an endeavor for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1949. Between the late 1930s and early 1970s, the leucotomy was a widely accepted practice, often performed in non-sterile environments such as small outpatient clinics and patient homes. Psychosurgery remained standard practice until the discovery of antipsychotic pharmacology in the 1950s.\nThe first clinical trial of antipsychotics (also commonly known as neuroleptics) for the treatment of psychosis took place in 1952. Chlorpromazine (brand name: Thorazine) passed clinical trials and became the first antipsychotic medication approved for the treatment of both acute and chronic psychosis. Although the mechanism of action was not discovered until 1963, the administration of chlorpromazine marked the advent of the dopamine antagonist, or first generation antipsychotic. While clinical trials showed a high response rate for both acute psychosis and disorders with psychotic features, the side effects were particularly harsh, which included high rates of often irreversible Parkinsonian symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia. With the advent of atypical antipsychotics (also known as second generation antipsychotics) came a dopamine antagonist with a comparable response rate but a far different, though still extensive, side-effect profile that included a lower risk of Parkinsonian symptoms but a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Atypical antipsychotics remain the first-line treatment for psychosis associated with various psychiatric and neurological disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, dementia, and some autism spectrum disorders.\nDopamine is now one of the primary neurotransmitters implicated in psychotic symptomology. Blocking dopamine receptors (namely, the dopamine D2 receptors) and decreasing dopaminergic activity continues to be an effective but highly unrefined effect of antipsychotics, which are commonly used to treat psychosis. Recent pharmacological research suggests that the decrease in dopaminergic activity does not eradicate psychotic delusions or hallucinations, but rather attenuates the reward mechanisms involved in the development of delusional thinking; that is, connecting or finding meaningful relationships between unrelated stimuli or ideas. The author of this research paper acknowledges the importance of future investigation:\nThe model presented here is based on incomplete knowledge related to dopamine, schizophrenia, and antipsychotics—and as such will need to evolve as more is known about these.— Shitij Kapur, From dopamine to salience to psychosis—linking biology, pharmacology and phenomenology of psychosis\nFreud's former student Wilhelm Reich explored independent insights into the physical effects of neurotic and traumatic upbringing, and published his holistic psychoanalytic treatment with a schizophrenic. With his incorporation of breathwork and insight with the patient, a young woman, she achieved sufficient self-management skills to end the therapy.\nLacan extended Freud's ideas to create a psychoanalytic model of psychosis based upon the concept of \"foreclosure\", the rejection of the symbolic concept of the father.\n### Society\nPsychiatrist David Healy has criticised pharmaceutical companies for promoting simplified biological theories of mental illness that seem to imply the primacy of pharmaceutical treatments while ignoring social and developmental factors that are known important influences in the etiology of psychosis.\n### Disability\nThe classification of psychosis as a social disability is a common occurrence.\nPsychosis is considered to be among the top 10 causes of social disability among adult men and women in developed countries. And the traditional, negative narrative around disability has been shown to strongly and adversely influence the pathways through employment and education for people experiencing psychosis.\nSocial disability by way of social disconnection is a significant public health concern and is associated with a broad range of negative outcomes, including premature mortality. Social disconnection refers to the ongoing absence of family or social relationships with marginal participation in social activities.\nN. Myers (2019), N. A. L. Myers (2012) and Brown (2011) found that reduced participation in social networks, not only negatively effects the individual on a physical and mental level, it has been shown that failure to be included in social networks influences the individual's ability to participate in the wider community through employment and education opportunities.\nN. Myers (2019) discuss how equal opportunity to participate in meaningful relationships with friends, family and partners, as well as engaging in social constructs such as employment, can provide significant physical and mental value to people's lives. And how breaking the disability mindset around people experiencing psychosis is imperative for their overall, long-term health and wellbeing as well as the contributions they are able to make to their immediate social connections and the wider community.\n## Causes\nThe symptoms of psychosis may be caused by serious psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, a number of medical illnesses, and trauma. Psychosis may also be temporary or transient, and be caused by medications or substance use disorder (substance-induced psychosis).\n### Normal states\nBrief hallucinations are not uncommon in those without any psychiatric disease, including healthy children. Causes or triggers include:\nFalling asleep and waking: hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations Bereavement, in which hallucinations of a deceased loved one are common Severe sleep deprivation Extreme stress (see below)\n### Trauma and stress\nTraumatic life events have been linked with an elevated risk of developing psychotic symptoms. Childhood trauma has specifically been shown to be a predictor of adolescent and adult psychosis. Individuals with psychotic symptoms are three times more likely to have experienced childhood trauma (e.g., physical or sexual abuse, physical or emotional neglect) than those in the general population. Increased individual vulnerability toward psychosis may interact with traumatic experiences promoting an onset of future psychotic symptoms, particularly during sensitive developmental periods. Importantly, the relationship between traumatic life events and psychotic symptoms appears to be dose-dependent in which multiple traumatic life events accumulate, compounding symptom expression and severity. However, acute, stressful events can also trigger brief psychotic episodes. Trauma prevention and early intervention may be an important target for decreasing the incidence of psychotic disorders and ameliorating its effects.A healthy person could become psychotic if he is placed in an empty room with no light and sound after 15 minutes, a phenomenon known as sensory deprivation.\nNeuroticism, a personality trait associated with vulnerability to stressors, is an independent predictor of the development of psychosis.\n### Psychiatric disorders\nFrom a diagnostic standpoint, organic disorders were believed to be caused by physical illness affecting the brain (that is, psychiatric disorders secondary to other conditions) while functional disorders were considered disorders of the functioning of the mind in the absence of physical disorders (that is, primary psychological or psychiatric disorders). Subtle physical abnormalities have been found in illnesses traditionally considered functional, such as schizophrenia. The DSM-IV-TR avoids the functional/organic distinction, and instead lists traditional psychotic illnesses, psychosis due to general medical conditions, and substance-induced psychosis.\nPrimary psychiatric causes of psychosis include the following:\nschizophrenia mood disorders, including major depression, and severe depression or mania in bipolar disorder (manic depression). People experiencing a psychotic episode in the context of depression may experience persecutory or self-blaming delusions or hallucinations, while people experiencing a psychotic episode in the context of mania may form grandiose delusions. schizoaffective disorder, involving symptoms of both schizophrenia and one or more mood disorders delusional disorder (persistent delusional disorder)\nPsychotic symptoms may also be seen in:\nSchizotypal personality disorder Certain personality disorders in times of stress (including paranoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder) Major depressive disorder in its severe form, although it is possible and more likely to have severe depression without psychosis Bipolar disorder in the manic and mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder and depressive episodes of both bipolar I and bipolar II; however, it is possible to experience such states without psychotic symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder Chronic hallucinatory psychosis Shared delusional disorder Sometimes in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) Dissociative disorders, due to many overlapping symptoms. It is also important to note that those with dissociative disorders may be more vulnerable to psychotic symptoms due to the disconnect from reality that is already experienced. Careful differential diagnosis includes especially dissociative identity disorder.\n#### Subtypes\nSubtypes of psychosis include:\nPostpartum psychosis, occurring shortly after giving birth, primarily associated with maternal bipolar disorder Monothematic delusions Myxedematous psychosis Stimulant psychosis Tardive psychosis Shared psychosis (folie à deux)\n#### Cycloid psychosis\nCycloid psychosis is typically an acute, self-limiting form of psychosis with psychotic and mood symptoms that progress from normal to full-blown, usually between a few hours to days, and not related to drug intake or brain injury. While proposed as a distinct entity, clinically separate from schizophrenia and affective disorders, cycloid psychosis is not formally acknowledged by current ICD or DSM criteria. Its unclear place in psychiatric nosology has likely contributed to the limited scientific investigation and literature on the topic.\n#### Postpartum psychosis\nPostpartum psychosis is a rare yet serious and debilitating form of psychosis. Symptoms range from fluctuating moods and insomnia to mood-incongruent delusions related to the individual or the infant. Women experiencing postpartum psychosis are at increased risk for suicide or infanticide. Many women who experience first-time psychosis from postpartum often have bipolar disorder, meaning they could experience an increase of psychotic episodes even after postpartum.\n### Medical conditions\nA very large number of medical conditions can cause psychosis, sometimes called secondary psychosis. Examples include:\ndisorders causing delirium (toxic psychosis), in which consciousness is disturbed neurodevelopmental disorders and chromosomal abnormalities, including velocardiofacial syndrome neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson's disease focal neurological disease, such as stroke, brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, and some forms of epilepsy malignancy (typically via masses in the brain, paraneoplastic syndromes) infectious and postinfectious syndromes, including infections causing delirium, viral encephalitis, HIV/AIDS, malaria, syphilis endocrine disease, such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, hypoparathyroidism and hyperparathyroidism; sex hormones also affect psychotic symptoms and sometimes giving birth can provoke psychosis, termed postpartum psychosis inborn errors of metabolism, such as Wilson's disease, porphyria, and homocysteinemia. nutritional deficiency, such as vitamin B12 deficiency other acquired metabolic disorders, including electrolyte disturbances such as hypocalcemia, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypermagnesemia, hypercalcemia, and hypophosphatemia, but also hypoglycemia, hypoxia, and failure of the liver or kidneys autoimmune and related disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus, SLE), sarcoidosis, Hashimoto's encephalopathy, anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity poisoning, by therapeutic drugs (see below), recreational drugs (see below), and a range of plants, fungi, metals, organic compounds, and a few animal toxins sleep disorders, such as in narcolepsy (in which REM sleep intrudes into wakefulness) parasitic diseases, such as neurocysticercosis huntington disease\n### Psychoactive drugs\nVarious psychoactive substances (both legal and illegal) have been implicated in causing, exacerbating, or precipitating psychotic states or disorders in users, with varying levels of evidence. This may be upon intoxication for a more prolonged period after use, or upon withdrawal. Individuals who experience substance-induced psychosis tend to have a greater awareness of their psychosis and tend to have higher levels of suicidal thinking compared to those who have a primary psychotic illness. Drugs commonly alleged to induce psychotic symptoms include alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, cathinones, psychedelic drugs (such as LSD and psilocybin), κ-opioid receptor agonists (such as enadoline and salvinorin A) and NMDA receptor antagonists (such as phencyclidine and ketamine). Caffeine may worsen symptoms in those with schizophrenia and cause psychosis at very high doses in people without the condition. Cannabis and other illicit recreational drugs are often associated with psychosis in adolescents and cannabis use before 15 years old may increase the risk of psychosis in adulthood.\n#### Alcohol\nApproximately three percent of people with alcoholism experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to the long-term effects of alcohol consumption resulting in distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as thiamin deficiency. It is possible that hazardous alcohol use via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance-induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as causing psychosocial impairments. Delirium Tremens, a symptom of chronic alcoholism which can appear in the acute withdrawal phase, shares many symptoms with alcohol-related psychosis suggesting a common mechanism.\n#### Cannabis\nAccording to current studies, cannabis use is associated with increased risk of psychotic disorders, and the more often cannabis is used the more likely a person is to develop a psychotic illness. Furthermore, people with a history of cannabis use develop psychotic symptoms earlier than those who have never used cannabis. Some debate exists regarding the causal relationship between cannabis use and psychosis with some studies suggesting that cannabis use hastens the onset of psychosis primarily in those with pre-existing vulnerability. Indeed, cannabis use plays an important role in the development of psychosis in vulnerable individuals, and cannabis use in adolescence should be discouraged. Some studies indicate that the effects of two active compounds in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have opposite effects with respect to psychosis. While THC can induce psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals, limited evidence suggests that CBD may have antipsychotic effects.\n#### Methamphetamine\nMethamphetamine induces a psychosis in 26–46 percent of heavy users. Some of these people develop a long-lasting psychosis that can persist for longer than six months. Those who have had a short-lived psychosis from methamphetamine can have a relapse of the methamphetamine psychosis years later after a stressful event such as severe insomnia or a period of hazardous alcohol use despite not relapsing back to methamphetamine. Individuals who have a long history of methamphetamine use and who have experienced psychosis in the past from methamphetamine use are highly likely to re-experience methamphetamine psychosis if drug use is recommenced. Methamphetamine-induced psychosis is likely gated by genetic vulnerability, which can produce long-term changes in brain neurochemistry following repetitive use.\n### Medication\nAdministration, or sometimes withdrawal, of a large number of medications may provoke psychotic symptoms. Drugs that can induce psychosis experimentally or in a significant proportion of people include stimulants, such as amphetamine and other sympathomimetics, dopamine agonists, ketamine, corticosteroids (often with mood changes in addition), and some anticonvulsants such as vigabatrin.\n## Pathophysiology\n### Neuroimaging\nThe first brain image of an individual with psychosis was completed as far back as 1935 using a technique called pneumoencephalography (a painful and now obsolete procedure where cerebrospinal fluid is drained from around the brain and replaced with air to allow the structure of the brain to show up more clearly on an X-ray picture).\nBoth first episode psychosis, and high risk status is associated with reductions in grey matter volume (GMV). First episode psychotic and high risk populations are associated with similar but distinct abnormalities in GMV. Reductions in the right middle temporal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus (STG), right parahippocampus, right hippocampus, right middle frontal gyrus, and left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are observed in high risk populations. Reductions in first episode psychosis span a region from the right STG to the right insula, left insula, and cerebellum, and are more severe in the right ACC, right STG, insula and cerebellum.\nAnother meta analysis reported bilateral reductions in insula, operculum, STG, medial frontal cortex, and ACC, but also reported increased GMV in the right lingual gyrus and left precentral gyrus. The Kraepelinian dichotomy is made questionable by grey matter abnormalities in bipolar and schizophrenia; schizophrenia is distinguishable from bipolar in that regions of grey matter reduction are generally larger in magnitude, although adjusting for gender differences reduces the difference to the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nDuring attentional tasks, first episode psychosis is associated with hypoactivation in the right middle frontal gyrus, a region generally described as encompassing the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). In congruence with studies on grey matter volume, hypoactivity in the right insula, and right inferior parietal lobe is also reported. During cognitive tasks, hypoactivities in the right insula, dACC, and the left precuneus, as well as reduced deactivations in the right basal ganglia, right thalamus, right inferior frontal and left precentral gyri are observed. These results are highly consistent and replicable possibly except the abnormalities of the right inferior frontal gyrus. Decreased grey matter volume in conjunction with bilateral hypoactivity is observed in anterior insula, dorsal medial frontal cortex, and dorsal ACC. Decreased grey matter volume and bilateral hyperactivity is reported in posterior insula, ventral medial frontal cortex, and ventral ACC.\n### Hallucinations\nStudies during acute experiences of hallucinations demonstrate increased activity in primary or secondary sensory cortices. As auditory hallucinations are most common in psychosis, most robust evidence exists for increased activity in the left middle temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, and left inferior frontal gyrus (i.e. Broca's area). Activity in the ventral striatum, hippocampus, and ACC are related to the lucidity of hallucinations, and indicate that activation or involvement of emotional circuitry are key to the impact of abnormal activity in sensory cortices. Together, these findings indicate abnormal processing of internally generated sensory experiences, coupled with abnormal emotional processing, results in hallucinations. One proposed model involves a failure of feedforward networks from sensory cortices to the inferior frontal cortex, which normally cancel out sensory cortex activity during internally generated speech. The resulting disruption in expected and perceived speech is thought to produce lucid hallucinatory experiences.\n### Delusions\nThe two-factor model of delusions posits that dysfunction in both belief formation systems and belief evaluation systems are necessary for delusions. Dysfunction in evaluations systems localized to the right lateral prefrontal cortex, regardless of delusion content, is supported by neuroimaging studies and is congruent with its role in conflict monitoring in healthy persons. Abnormal activation and reduced volume is seen in people with delusions, as well as in disorders associated with delusions such as frontotemporal dementia, psychosis and Lewy body dementia. Furthermore, lesions to this region are associated with \"jumping to conclusions\", damage to this region is associated with post-stroke delusions, and hypometabolism this region associated with caudate strokes presenting with delusions.\nThe aberrant salience model suggests that delusions are a result of people assigning excessive importance to irrelevant stimuli. In support of this hypothesis, regions normally associated with the salience network demonstrate reduced grey matter in people with delusions, and the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is widely implicated in salience processing, is also widely implicated in psychotic disorders.\nSpecific regions have been associated with specific types of delusions. The volume of the hippocampus and parahippocampus is related to paranoid delusions in Alzheimer's disease, and has been reported to be abnormal post mortem in one person with delusions. Capgras delusions have been associated with occipito-temporal damage, and may be related to failure to elicit normal emotions or memories in response to faces.\n### Negative symptoms\nPsychosis is associated with ventral striatal (VS) which is the part of the brain that is involved with the desire to naturally satisfy the body's needs. When high reports of negative symptoms were recorded, there were significant irregularities in the left VS. Anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, is a commonly reported symptom in psychosis; experiences are present in most people with schizophrenia. The impairment that may present itself as anhedonia derives from the inability to not only identify goals, but to also identify and engage in the behaviors necessary to achieve goals. Studies support a deficiency in the neural representation of goals and goal directed behavior by demonstrating that when the reward is not anticipated, there is a strong correlation of high reaction in the ventral striatum; reinforcement learning is intact when contingencies about stimulus-reward are implicit, but not when they require explicit neural processing; reward prediction errors are what the actual reward is versus what the reward was predicted to be. In most cases positive prediction errors are considered an abnormal occurrence. A positive prediction error response occurs when there is an increased activation in a brain region, typically the striatum, in response to unexpected rewards. A negative prediction error response occurs when there is a decreased activation in a region when predicted rewards do not occur. Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) response, taken as an indicator of effort allocation, does not increase with reward or reward probability increase, and is associated with negative symptoms; deficits in Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC) activity and failure to improve performance on cognitive tasks when offered monetary incentives are present; and dopamine mediated functions are abnormal.\n### Neurobiology\nPsychosis has been traditionally linked to the overactivity of the neurotransmitter dopamine. In particular to its effect in the mesolimbic pathway. The two major sources of evidence given to support this theory are that dopamine receptor D2 blocking drugs (i.e., antipsychotics) tend to reduce the intensity of psychotic symptoms, and that drugs that accentuate dopamine release, or inhibit its reuptake (such as amphetamines and cocaine) can trigger psychosis in some people (see stimulant psychosis).\nNMDA receptor dysfunction has been proposed as a mechanism in psychosis. This theory is reinforced by the fact that dissociative NMDA receptor antagonists such as ketamine, PCP and dextromethorphan (at large overdoses) induce a psychotic state. The symptoms of dissociative intoxication are also considered to mirror the symptoms of schizophrenia, including negative symptoms. NMDA receptor antagonism, in addition to producing symptoms reminiscent of psychosis, mimics the neurophysiological aspects, such as reduction in the amplitude of P50, P300, and MMN evoked potentials. Hierarchical Bayesian neurocomputational models of sensory feedback, in agreement with neuroimaging literature, link NMDA receptor hypofunction to delusional or hallucinatory symptoms via proposing a failure of NMDA mediated top down predictions to adequately cancel out enhanced bottom up AMPA mediated predictions errors. Excessive prediction errors in response to stimuli that would normally not produce such a response is thought to root from conferring excessive salience to otherwise mundane events. Dysfunction higher up in the hierarchy, where representation is more abstract, could result in delusions. The common finding of reduced GAD67 expression in psychotic disorders may explain enhanced AMPA mediated signaling, caused by reduced GABAergic inhibition.\nThe connection between dopamine and psychosis is generally believed to be complex. While dopamine receptor D2 suppresses adenylate cyclase activity, the D1 receptor increases it. If D2-blocking drugs are administered, the blocked dopamine spills over to the D1 receptors. The increased adenylate cyclase activity affects genetic expression in the nerve cell, which takes time. Hence antipsychotic drugs take a week or two to reduce the symptoms of psychosis. Moreover, newer and equally effective antipsychotic drugs actually block slightly less dopamine in the brain than older drugs whilst also blocking 5-HT2A receptors, suggesting the 'dopamine hypothesis' may be oversimplified. Soyka and colleagues found no evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction in people with alcohol-induced psychosis and Zoldan et al. reported moderately successful use of ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, in the treatment of levodopa psychosis in Parkinson's disease patients.\nA review found an association between a first-episode of psychosis and prediabetes.\nProlonged or high dose use of psychostimulants can alter normal functioning, making it similar to the manic phase of bipolar disorder. NMDA antagonists replicate some of the so-called \"negative\" symptoms like thought disorder in subanesthetic doses (doses insufficient to induce anesthesia), and catatonia in high doses). Psychostimulants, especially in one already prone to psychotic thinking, can cause some \"positive\" symptoms, such as delusional beliefs, particularly those persecutory in nature.\n### Culture\nCross-cultural studies into schizophrenia have found that individual experiences of psychosis and ‘hearing voices’ vary across cultures. In countries such as the United States where there exists a predominantly biomedical understanding of the body, the mind and in turn, mental health, subjects were found to report their hallucinations as having ‘violent content’ and self-describing as ‘crazy’. This lived experience is at odds with the lived experience of subjects in Accra, Ghana, who describe the voices they hear as having ‘spiritual meaning’ and are often reported as positive in nature; or subjects in Chennai, India, who describe their hallucinations as kin, family members or close friends, and offering guidance.\nThese differences are attributed to ‘social kindling’ or how one's social context shapes how an individual interprets and experiences sensations such as hallucinations. This concept aligns with pre-existing cognitive theory such as reality modelling and is supported by recent research that demonstrates that individuals with psychosis can be taught to attend to their hallucinations differently, which in turn alters the hallucinations themselves. Such research creates pathways for social or community-based treatment, such as reality monitoring, for individuals with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, providing alternatives to, or supplementing traditional pharmacologic management.\nCross-cultural studies explore the way in which psychosis varies in different cultures, countries and religions. The cultural differences are based on the individual or shared illness narratives surrounding cultural meanings of illness experience. In countries such as India, Cambodia and Muslim majority countries, they each share alternative epistemologies. These are known as knowledge systems that focus on the connections between mind, body, culture, nature, and society. Cultural perceptions of mental disorders such as psychosis or schizophrenia are believed to be caused by jinn (spirits) in Muslim majority countries. Furthermore, those in Arab-Muslim societies perceive those who act differently than the social norm as “crazy” or as abnormal behaviour. This differs from the lived experience of individuals in India and how they attain their perspectives on mental health issues through a variety of spiritual and healing traditions. In Cambodia, hallucinations are linked with spirit visitation, a term they call “cultural kindling”. These examples of differences are attributed to culture and the way it shapes conceptions of mental disorders. These cultural differences can be useful in bridging the gap of cultural understanding and psychiatric signs and symptoms.\n## Diagnosis\nTo make a diagnosis of a mental illness in someone with psychosis other potential causes must be excluded. An initial assessment includes a comprehensive history and physical examination by a health care provider. Tests may be done to exclude substance use, medication, toxins, surgical complications, or other medical illnesses. A person with psychosis is referred to as psychotic.\nDelirium should be ruled out, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, indicating other underlying factors, including medical illnesses. Excluding medical illnesses associated with psychosis is performed by using blood tests to measure:\nThyroid-stimulating hormone to exclude hypo- or hyperthyroidism, Basic electrolytes and serum calcium to rule out a metabolic disturbance, Full blood count including ESR to rule out a systemic infection or chronic disease, and Serology to exclude syphilis or HIV infection.\nOther investigations include:\nEEG to exclude epilepsy, and an MRI or CT scan of the head to exclude brain lesions.\nBecause psychosis may be precipitated or exacerbated by common classes of medications, medication-induced psychosis should be ruled out, particularly for first-episode psychosis. Both substance- and medication-induced psychosis can be excluded to a high level of certainty, using toxicology screening.\nBecause some dietary supplements may also induce psychosis or mania, but cannot be ruled out with laboratory tests, a psychotic individual's family, partner, or friends should be asked whether the patient is currently taking any dietary supplements.\nCommon mistakes made when diagnosing people who are psychotic include:\nNot properly excluding delirium, Not appreciating medical abnormalities (e.g., vital signs), Not obtaining a medical history and family history, Indiscriminate screening without an organizing framework, Missing a toxic psychosis by not screening for substances and medications, Not asking their family or others about dietary supplements, Premature diagnostic closure, and Not revisiting or questioning the initial diagnostic impression of primary psychiatric disorder.\nOnly after relevant and known causes of psychosis are excluded, a mental health clinician may make a psychiatric differential diagnosis using a person's family history, incorporating information from the person with psychosis, and information from family, friends, or significant others.\nTypes of psychosis in psychiatric disorders may be established by formal rating scales. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) assesses the level of 18 symptom constructs of psychosis such as hostility, suspicion, hallucination, and grandiosity. It is based on the clinician's interview with the patient and observations of the patient's behavior over the previous 2–3 days. The patient's family can also answer questions on the behavior report. During the initial assessment and the follow-up, both positive and negative symptoms of psychosis can be assessed using the 30 item Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS).\nThe DSM-5 characterizes disorders as psychotic or on the schizophrenia spectrum if they involve hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, grossly disorganized motor behavior, or negative symptoms. The DSM-5 does not include psychosis as a definition in the glossary, although it defines \"psychotic features\", as well as \"psychoticism\" with respect to personality disorder. The ICD-10 has no specific definition of psychosis.\nFactor analysis of symptoms generally regarded as psychosis frequently yields a five factor solution, albeit five factors that are distinct from the five domains defined by the DSM-5 to encompass psychotic or schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The five factors are frequently labeled as hallucinations, delusions, disorganization, excitement, and emotional distress. The DSM-5 emphasizes a psychotic spectrum, wherein the low end is characterized by schizoid personality disorder, and the high end is characterized by schizophrenia.\n## Prevention\nThe evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent psychosis appeared inconclusive. But psychosis caused by drugs can be prevented. Whilst early intervention in those with a psychotic episode might improve short-term outcomes, little benefit was seen from these measures after five years. However, there is evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may reduce the risk of becoming psychotic in those at high risk, and in 2014 the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended preventive CBT for people at risk of psychosis.\n## Treatment\nThe treatment of psychosis depends on the specific diagnosis (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or substance intoxication). The first-line treatment for many psychotic disorders is antipsychotic medication,  which can reduce the positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 to 14 days. For youth or adolescents, treatment options include medications, psychological interventions, and social interventions.\n### Medication\nThe choice of which antipsychotic to use is based on benefits, risks, and costs. It is debatable whether, as a class, typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. Tentative evidence supports that amisulpride, olanzapine, risperidone and clozapine may be more effective for positive symptoms but result in more side effects. Typical antipsychotics have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates to atypicals when used at low to moderate dosages. There is a good response in 40–50%, a partial response in 30–40%, and treatment resistance (failure of symptoms to respond satisfactorily after six weeks to two or three different antipsychotics) in 20% of people. Clozapine is an effective treatment for those who respond poorly to other drugs (\"treatment-resistant\" or \"refractory\" schizophrenia), but it has the potentially serious side effect of agranulocytosis (lowered white blood cell count) in less than 4% of people.\nMost people on antipsychotics get side effects. People on typical antipsychotics tend to have a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol.\n### Psychotherapy\nPsychological treatments such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) are possibly useful in the treatment of psychosis, helping people to focus more on what they can do in terms of valued life directions despite challenging symptomology. Metacognitive training (MCT) is associated with reduced delusions, hallucinations and negative symptoms as well as improved self-esteem and functioning in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.\nThere are many psychosocial interventions that seek to treat the symptoms of psychosis: need adapted treatment, Open Dialogue, psychoanalysis/psychodynamic psychotherapy, major role therapy, soteria, psychosocial outpatient and inpatient treatment, milieu therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). When these are used without antipsychotic medications, they may be somewhat effective for some people, especially for CBT, need-adapted treatment, and soteria.\n### Early intervention\nEarly intervention in psychosis is based on the observation that identifying and treating someone in the early stages of a psychosis can improve their longer term outcome. This approach advocates the use of an intensive multi-disciplinary approach during what is known as the critical period, where intervention is the most effective, and prevents the long-term morbidity associated with chronic psychotic illness.\n### Systematic reform\nAddressing systematic reform is essential to creating effective prevention as well as supporting treatments and recovery for those with psychosis.\nWaghorn et al. suggest that education interventions can be a building block to support those with psychosis to successfully participate in society. In their study they analyse the relationship between successful education attainment and psychosis. Findings suggest proportionately more school aged persons with psychosis discontinued their education, compared to those without psychosis.\nWaghorn et al. finds that specialised supported education for those with psychotic disorders can help lead to successful education attainment. Additionally, future employment outcomes are relative to such education attainment. Established approaches to supported education in the US include three basic models, self-contained classrooms, onsite support model and the mobile support model. Each model includes the participation of mental health service staff or educational facility staff in the student's education arrangements.\nPotential benefits of specialised supported education found from this study include coordination with other service providers (e.g. income support, housing, etc.) to prevent disrupting education, providing specialised career counselling, development of coping skills in the academic environment. These examples provide beneficial ways for people with psychosis to finish studies successfully as well as counter future experiences of psychosis.\n## Research\nFurther research in the form of randomized controlled trials is needed to determine the effectiveness of treatment approaches for helping adolescents with psychosis. Through 10 randomized clinical trials, studies showed that Early Intervention Services (EIS) for patients with early-phase schizophrenia spectrum disorders have generated promising outcomes. EIS are specifically intended to fulfill the needs of patients with early-phase psychosis. In addition, one meta-analysis that consisted of four randomized clinical trials has examined and discovered the efficacy of EIS to Therapy as Usual (TAU) for early-phase psychosis, revealing that EIS techniques are superior to TAU.\nA study suggests that combining cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with SlowMo, an app that helps notice their \"unhelpful quick-thinking\" might be more effective for treating paranoia in people with psychosis than CBT alone."], "selected_questions": ["What is paranoia and how is it treated?", "How are hallucinations related to abnormal brain activity?", "How can the neurotransmitter dopamine be related to psychosis?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Paranoia is a special syndrome that can be a feature of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder or that can exist by itself.

{"name": "Ship", "documents": ["# Ship\nA ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying cargo or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research, and fishing. Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity, and purpose. Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, and science. After the 15th century, new crops that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to world population growth. Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.\nThe word ship has meant, depending on the era and the context, either just a large vessel or specifically a ship-rigged sailing ship with three or more masts, each of which is square-rigged.\nAs of 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion dead weight tons. Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships.\n## Nomenclature\nShips are typically larger than boats, but there is no universally accepted distinction between the two. Ships generally can remain at sea for longer periods of time than boats. A legal definition of ship from Indian case law is a vessel that carries goods by sea. A common notion is that a ship can carry a boat, but not vice versa. A ship is likely to have a full-time crew assigned. A US Navy rule of thumb is that ships heel towards the outside of a sharp turn, whereas boats heel towards the inside because of the relative location of the center of mass versus the center of buoyancy. American and British 19th century maritime law distinguished \"vessels\" from other watercraft; ships and boats fall in one legal category, whereas open boats and rafts are not considered vessels.\nParticularly in the Age of Sail, the word ship might apply generally to a seagoing vessel or particularly to a full-rigged sailing ship with three or more masts, all square-rigged. Other rigs on seagoing vessels included brig, barque, and barquentine.: 8 : 2 : 222 \nSome large vessels are traditionally called boats, notably submarines. Others include Great Lakes freighters, riverboats, and ferryboats, which may be designed for operation on inland or protected coastal waters.\nIn most maritime traditions ships have individual names, and modern ships may belong to a ship class often named after its first ship.\nIn many documents the ship name is introduced with a ship prefix being an abbreviation of the ship class, for example \"MS\" (motor ship) or \"SV\" (sailing vessel), making it easier to distinguish a ship name from other individual names in a text.\n\"Ship\" (along with \"nation\") is an English word that has retained a female grammatical gender in some usages, which allows it sometimes to be referred to as a \"she\" without being of female natural gender.\n## History\n### Prehistory and antiquity\n#### Asian developments\nThe earliest attestations of ships in maritime transport in Mesopotamia are model ships, which date back to the 4th millennium BC. In archaic texts in Uruk, Sumer, the ideogram for \"ship\" is attested, but in the inscriptions of the kings of Lagash, ships were first mentioned in connection to maritime trade and naval warfare at around 2500–2350 BCE.\nAustronesian peoples originated in what is now Taiwan. From here, they took part in the Austronesian Expansion. Their distinctive maritime technology was integral to this movement and included catamarans and outriggers. It has been deduced that they had sails some time before 2000 BCE.: 144  Their crab claw sails enabled them to sail for vast distances in open ocean. From Taiwan, they rapidly colonized the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia, then sailed further onwards to Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar, eventually colonizing a territory spanning half the globe.\nAustronesian rigs were distinctive in that they had spars supporting both the upper and lower edges of the sails (and sometimes in between). The sails were also made from woven leaves, usually from pandan plants. These were complemented by paddlers, who usually positioned themselves on platforms on the outriggers in the larger boats. Austronesian ships ranged in complexity from simple dugout canoes with outriggers or lashed together to large edge-pegged plank-built boats built around a keel made from a dugout canoe. Their designs were unique, evolving from ancient rafts to the characteristic double-hulled, single-outrigger, and double-outrigger designs of Austronesian ships.\nEarly Austronesian sailors influenced the development of sailing technologies in Sri Lanka and Southern India through the Austronesian maritime trade network of the Indian Ocean, the precursor to the spice trade route and the maritime silk road, which was established at around 1500 BC. Some scholars believe that the triangular Austronesian crab claw sail may have influenced the development of the lateen sail in western ships due to early contact. The junk rigs of Chinese ships is also believed to be developed from tilted sails.: 612–613 \nIn the 2nd century AD, people from the Indonesian archipelago already made large ships measuring over 50 m long and standing 4–7 m out of the water. They could carry 600–1000 people and 250–1000 ton cargo. These ships were known as kunlun bo or k'unlun po (昆仑舶, lit. \"ship of the Kunlun people\") by the Chinese, and kolandiaphonta by the Greeks. They had 4–7 masts and were able to sail against the wind due to the usage of tanja sails. These ships may have reached as far as Ghana.: 41 : 262 : 347  In the 11th century, a new type of ship called djong or jong was recorded in Java and Bali.: 222, 230, 267 : 82  This type of ship was built using wooden dowels and treenails, unlike the kunlun bo which used vegetal fibres for lashings.: 138 \nIn China, miniature models of ships that feature steering oars have been dated to the Warring States period (c. 475–221 BC). By the Han dynasty, a well kept naval fleet was an integral part of the military. Sternpost-mounted rudders started to appear on Chinese ship models starting in the 1st century AD. However, these early Chinese ships were fluvial (riverine), and were not seaworthy.: 20  The Chinese only acquired sea-going ship technologies in the 10th century AD Song Dynasty after contact with Southeast Asian k'un-lun po trading ships, leading to the development of the junks.: 20–21 \n#### Mediterranean developments\nArchaeological evidence in Egypt, dated to 3000 BC, shows wooden planks assembled into a hull. They used woven straps to lash the planks together, and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams. The Greek historian and geographer Agatharchides had documented ship-faring among the early Egyptians: \"During the prosperous period of the Old Kingdom, between the 30th and 25th centuries BC, the river-routes were kept in order, and Egyptian ships sailed the Red Sea as far as the myrrh-country.\" Sneferu's ancient cedar wood ship Praise of the Two Lands is the first reference recorded (2613 BC) to a ship being referred to by name.\nThe ancient Egyptians were perfectly at ease building sailboats. A remarkable example of their shipbuilding skills was the Khufu ship, a vessel 143 feet (44 m) in length entombed at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza around 2500 BC and found intact in 1954.\nThe oldest discovered sea faring hulled boat is the Late Bronze Age Uluburun shipwreck off the coast of Turkey, dating back to 1300 BC.\nBy 1200 B.C., the Phoenicians were building large merchant ships. In world maritime history, declares Richard Woodman, they are recognized as \"the first true seafarers, founding the art of pilotage, cabotage, and navigation\" and the architects of \"the first true ship, built of planks, capable of carrying a deadweight cargo and being sailed and steered.\"\n### 14th through the 18th centuries\n#### Asian developments\nAt this time, ships were developing in Asia in much the same way as Europe. Japan used defensive naval techniques in the Mongol invasions of Japan in 1281. It is likely that the Mongols of the time took advantage of both European and Asian shipbuilding techniques. During the 15th century, China's Ming dynasty assembled one of the largest and most powerful naval fleets in the world for the diplomatic and power projection voyages of Zheng He. Elsewhere in Japan in the 15th century, one of the world's first iron-clads, \"Tekkōsen\" (鉄甲船), literally meaning \"iron ships\", was also developed. In Japan, during the Sengoku era from the 15th century to 17th century, the great struggle for feudal supremacy was fought, in part, by coastal fleets of several hundred boats, including the atakebune. In Korea, in the early 15th century during the Joseon era, \"Geobukseon\"(거북선), was developed.\nThe empire of Majapahit used large ships called jong, built in northern Java, for transporting troops overseas.: 115  The jongs were transport ships which could carry 100–2000 tons of cargo and 50–1000 people, 28.99–88.56 meter in length.: 60–62  The exact number of jong fielded by Majapahit is unknown, but the largest number of jong deployed in an expedition is about 400 jongs, when Majapahit attacked Pasai, in 1350.\n#### European developments\nSeveral civilizations became sea powers. Such examples include the maritime republics of Genoa and Venice, Hanseatic League, and the Byzantine navy. The Vikings used their knarrs to explore North America, trade in the Baltic Sea and plunder many of the coastal regions of Western Europe.\nTowards the end of the 14th century, ships like the carrack began to develop towers on the bow and stern. These towers decreased the vessel's stability, and in the 15th century, the caravel, designed by the Portuguese, based on the Arabic qarib which could sail closer to the wind, became more widely used. The towers were gradually replaced by the forecastle and sterncastle, as in the carrack Santa María of Christopher Columbus. This increased freeboard allowed another innovation: the freeing port, and the artillery associated with it.\nThe carrack and then the caravel were developed in Portugal. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established. In 1498, by reaching India, Vasco da Gama proved that access to the Indian Ocean from the Atlantic was possible. These explorations in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans were soon followed by France, England and the Netherlands, who explored the Portuguese and Spanish trade routes into the Pacific Ocean, reaching Australia in 1606 and New Zealand in 1642.\n### Specialization and modernization\nParallel to the development of warships, ships in service of marine fishery and trade also developed in the period between antiquity and the Renaissance.\nMaritime trade was driven by the development of shipping companies with significant financial resources. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on an adjacent towpath, contended with the railway up to and past the early days of the industrial revolution. Flat-bottomed and flexible scow boats also became widely used for transporting small cargoes. Mercantile trade went hand-in-hand with exploration, self-financed by the commercial benefits of exploration.\nDuring the first half of the 18th century, the French Navy began to develop a new type of vessel known as a ship of the line, featuring seventy-four guns. This type of ship became the backbone of all European fighting fleets. These ships were 56 metres (184 ft) long and their construction required 2,800 oak trees and 40 kilometres (25 mi) of rope; they carried a crew of about 800 sailors and soldiers.\nDuring the 19th century the Royal Navy enforced a ban on the slave trade, acted to suppress piracy, and continued to map the world. A clipper was a very fast sailing ship of the 19th century. The clipper routes fell into commercial disuse with the introduction of steam ships with better fuel efficiency, and the opening of the Suez and Panama Canals.\nShip designs stayed fairly unchanged until the late 19th century. The industrial revolution, new mechanical methods of propulsion, and the ability to construct ships from metal triggered an explosion in ship design. Factors including the quest for more efficient ships, the end of long running and wasteful maritime conflicts, and the increased financial capacity of industrial powers created an avalanche of more specialized boats and ships. Ships built for entirely new functions, such as firefighting, rescue, and research, also began to appear.\n### 21st century\nIn 2019, the world's fleet included 51,684 commercial vessels with gross tonnage of more than 1,000 tons, totaling 1.96 billion tons. Such ships carried 11 billion tons of cargo in 2018, a sum that grew by 2.7% over the previous year. In terms of tonnage, 29% of ships were tankers, 43% are bulk carriers, 13% container ships and 15% were other types.\nIn 2008, there were 1,240 warships operating in the world, not counting small vessels such as patrol boats. The United States accounted for 3 million tons worth of these vessels, Russia 1.35 million tons, the United Kingdom 504,660 tons and China 402,830 tons. The 20th century saw many naval engagements during the two world wars, the Cold War, and the rise to power of naval forces of the two blocs. The world's major powers have recently used their naval power in cases such as the United Kingdom in the Falkland Islands and the United States in Iraq.\nThe size of the world's fishing fleet is more difficult to estimate. The largest of these are counted as commercial vessels, but the smallest are legion. Fishing vessels can be found in most seaside villages in the world. As of 2004, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimated 4 million fishing vessels were operating worldwide. The same study estimated that the world's 29 million fishermen caught 85,800,000 tonnes (84,400,000 long tons; 94,600,000 short tons) of fish and shellfish that year.\n## Types of ships\nBecause ships are constructed using the principles of naval architecture that require same structural components, their classification is based on their function such as that suggested by Paulet and Presles, which requires modification of the components. The categories accepted in general by naval architects are:\nHigh-speed craft – Multihulls including wave piercers, small-waterplane-area twin hull (SWATH), surface effect ships and hovercraft, hydrofoil, wing in ground effect craft (WIG). Off shore oil vessels – Platform supply vessel, pipe layers, accommodation and crane barges, non and semi-submersible drilling rigs, production platforms, floating production storage and offloading units. Fishing vessels Motorised fishing trawlers, trap setters, seiners, longliners, trollers & factory ships. Traditional sailing and rowed fishing vessels and boats used for handline fishing Harbour work craft Cable layers Tugboats, dredgers, salvage vessels, tenders, Pilot boats. Floating dry docks, floating cranes, lightership. Dry cargo ships – tramp freighters, bulk carriers, cargo liners, container vessels, barge carriers, Ro-Ro ships, refrigerated cargo ships, timber carriers, livestock & light vehicle carriers. Liquid cargo ships – oil tankers, liquefied gas carriers, chemical carriers. Passenger vessels Liners, cruise and special trade passenger (STP) ships Cross-channel, coastal and harbour ferries Luxury and cruising yachts Sail training and multi-masted ships Recreational boats and craft – rowed, masted and motorised craft Special-purpose vessels – weather and research vessels, deep sea survey vessels, and icebreakers. Submersibles – industrial exploration, scientific research, tourist and hydrographic survey. Warships and other surface combatants – aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, minesweepers, etc.\nSome of these are discussed in the following sections.\n### Inland vessels\nFreshwater shipping may occur on lakes, rivers and canals. Ships designed for those body of waters may be specially adapted to the widths and depths of specific waterways. Examples of freshwater waterways that are navigable in part by large vessels include the Danube, Mississippi, Rhine, Yangtze and Amazon Rivers, and the Great Lakes.\n#### Great Lakes\nLake freighters, also called lakers, are cargo vessels that ply the Great Lakes. The most well-known is SS Edmund Fitzgerald, the latest major vessel to be wrecked on the Lakes. These vessels are traditionally called boats, not ships. Visiting ocean-going vessels are called \"salties\". Because of their additional beam, very large salties are never seen inland of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Because the smallest of the Soo Locks is larger than any Seaway lock, salties that can pass through the Seaway may travel anywhere in the Great Lakes. Because of their deeper draft, salties may accept partial loads on the Great Lakes, \"topping off\" when they have exited the Seaway. Similarly, the largest lakers are confined to the Upper Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie) because they are too large to use the Seaway locks, beginning at the Welland Canal that bypasses the Niagara River.\nSince the freshwater lakes are less corrosive to ships than the salt water of the oceans, lakers tend to last much longer than ocean freighters. Lakers older than 50 years are not unusual, and as of 2005, all were over 20 years of age.\nSS St. Marys Challenger, built in 1906 as William P Snyder, was the oldest laker still working on the Lakes until its conversion into a barge starting in 2013. Similarly, E.M. Ford, built in 1898 as Presque Isle, was sailing the lakes 98 years later in 1996. As of 2007 E.M. Ford was still afloat as a stationary transfer vessel at a riverside cement silo in Saginaw, Michigan.\n### Merchant ship\nMerchant ships are ships used for commercial purposes and can be divided into four broad categories: fishing, cargo ships, passenger ships, and special-purpose ships. The UNCTAD review of maritime transport categorizes ships as: oil tankers, bulk (and combination) carriers, general cargo ships, container ships, and \"other ships\", which includes \"liquefied petroleum gas carriers, liquefied natural gas carriers, parcel (chemical) tankers, specialized tankers, reefers, offshore supply, tugs, dredgers, cruise, ferries, other non-cargo\". General cargo ships include \"multi-purpose and project vessels and roll-on/roll-off cargo\".\nModern commercial vessels are typically powered by a single propeller driven by a diesel or, less usually, gas turbine engine., but until the mid-19th century they were predominantly square sail rigged. The fastest vessels may use pump-jet engines. Most commercial vessels have full hull-forms to maximize cargo capacity. Hulls are usually made of steel, although aluminum can be used on faster craft, and fiberglass on the smallest service vessels. Commercial vessels generally have a crew headed by a sea captain, with deck officers and engine officers on larger vessels. Special-purpose vessels often have specialized crew if necessary, for example scientists aboard research vessels.\nFishing boats are generally small, often little more than 30 meters (98 ft) but up to 100 metres (330 ft) for a large tuna or whaling ship. Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, 85,800,000 tonnes (84,400,000 long tons; 94,600,000 short tons) of fish were caught in the marine capture fishery. Anchoveta represented the largest single catch at 10,700,000 tonnes (10,500,000 long tons; 11,800,000 short tons). That year, the top ten marine capture species also included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring, Chub mackerel, Japanese anchovy, Chilean jack mackerel, Largehead hairtail, and Yellowfin tuna. Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.\nCargo ships transport dry and liquid cargo. Dry cargo can be transported in bulk by bulk carriers, packed directly onto a general cargo ship in break-bulk, packed in intermodal containers as aboard a container ship, or driven aboard as in roll-on roll-off ships. Liquid cargo is generally carried in bulk aboard tankers, such as oil tankers which may include both crude and finished products of oil, chemical tankers which may also carry vegetable oils other than chemicals and gas carriers, although smaller shipments may be carried on container ships in tank containers.\nPassenger ships range in size from small river ferries to very large cruise ships. This type of vessel includes ferries, which move passengers and vehicles on short trips; ocean liners, which carry passengers from one place to another; and cruise ships, which carry passengers on voyages undertaken for pleasure, visiting several places and with leisure activities on board, often returning them to the port of embarkation. Riverboats and inland ferries are specially designed to carry passengers, cargo, or both in the challenging river environment. Rivers present special hazards to vessels. They usually have varying water flows that alternately lead to high speed water flows or protruding rock hazards. Changing siltation patterns may cause the sudden appearance of shoal waters, and often floating or sunken logs and trees (called snags) can endanger the hulls and propulsion of riverboats. Riverboats are generally of shallow draft, being broad of beam and rather square in plan, with a low freeboard and high topsides. Riverboats can survive with this type of configuration as they do not have to withstand the high winds or large waves that are seen on large lakes, seas, or oceans.\nFishing vessels are a subset of commercial vessels, but generally small in size and often subject to different regulations and classification. They can be categorized by several criteria: architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, geographical origin, and technical features such as rigging. As of 2004, the world's fishing fleet consisted of some 4 million vessels. Of these, 1.3 million were decked vessels with enclosed areas and the rest were open vessels. Most decked vessels were mechanized, but two-thirds of the open vessels were traditional craft propelled by sails and oars. More than 60% of all existing large fishing vessels were built in Japan, Peru, the Russian Federation, Spain or the United States of America.\n### Special purpose vessels\nA weather ship was a ship stationed in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in marine weather forecasting. Surface weather observations were taken hourly, and four radiosonde releases occurred daily. It was also meant to aid in search and rescue operations and to support transatlantic flights. Proposed as early as 1927 by the aviation community, the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established a global network of weather ships in 1948, with 13 to be supplied by the United States. This number was eventually negotiated down to nine.\nThe weather ship crews were normally at sea for three weeks at a time, returning to port for 10-day stretches. Weather ship observations proved to be helpful in wind and wave studies, as they did not avoid weather systems like other ships tended to for safety reasons. They were also helpful in monitoring storms at sea, such as tropical cyclones. The removal of a weather ship became a negative factor in forecasts leading up to the Great Storm of 1987. Beginning in the 1970s, their role became largely superseded by weather buoys due to the ships' significant cost. The agreement of the use of weather ships by the international community ended in 1990. The last weather ship was Polarfront, known as weather station M (\"Mike\"), which was put out of operation on 1 January 2010. Weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation.\n### Naval vessels\nNaval ships are diverse in types of vessel. They include: surface warships, submarines, and auxiliary ships.\nModern warships are generally divided into seven main categories: aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines and amphibious assault ships. The distinctions among cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and corvettes are not codified; the same vessel may be described differently in different navies. Battleships were used during the Second World War and occasionally since then (the last battleships were removed from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register in March 2006), but were made obsolete by the use of carrier-borne aircraft and guided missiles.\nMost military submarines are either attack submarines or ballistic missile submarines. Until the end of World War II the primary role of the diesel/electric submarine was anti-ship warfare, inserting and removing covert agents and military forces, and intelligence-gathering. With the development of the homing torpedo, better sonar systems, and nuclear propulsion, submarines also became able to effectively hunt each other. The development of submarine-launched nuclear and cruise missiles gave submarines a substantial and long-ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from cluster munitions to nuclear weapons.\nMost navies also include many types of support and auxiliary vessel, such as minesweepers, patrol boats, offshore patrol vessels, replenishment ships, and hospital ships which are designated medical treatment facilities.\nFast combat vessels such as cruisers and destroyers usually have fine hulls to maximize speed and maneuverability. They also usually have advanced marine electronics and communication systems, as well as weapons.\n## Architecture\nSome components exist in vessels of any size and purpose. Every vessel has a hull of sorts. Every vessel has some sort of propulsion, whether it's a pole, an ox, or a nuclear reactor. Most vessels have some sort of steering system. Other characteristics are common, but not as universal, such as compartments, holds, a superstructure, and equipment such as anchors and winches.\n### Hull\nFor a ship to float, its weight must be less than that of the water displaced by the ship's hull. There are many types of hulls, from logs lashed together to form a raft to the advanced hulls of America's Cup sailboats. A vessel may have a single hull (called a monohull design), two in the case of catamarans, or three in the case of trimarans. Vessels with more than three hulls are rare, but some experiments have been conducted with designs such as pentamarans. Multiple hulls are generally parallel to each other and connected by rigid arms.\nHulls have several elements. The bow is the foremost part of the hull. Many ships feature a bulbous bow. The keel is at the very bottom of the hull, extending the entire length of the ship. The rear part of the hull is known as the stern, and many hulls have a flat back known as a transom. Common hull appendages include propellers for propulsion, rudders for steering, and stabilizers to quell a ship's rolling motion. Other hull features can be related to the vessel's work, such as fishing gear and sonar domes.\nHulls are subject to various hydrostatic and hydrodynamic constraints. The key hydrostatic constraint is that it must be able to support the entire weight of the boat, and maintain stability even with often unevenly distributed weight. Hydrodynamic constraints include the ability to withstand shock waves, weather collisions and groundings.\nOlder ships and pleasure craft often have or had wooden hulls. Steel is used for most commercial vessels. Aluminium is frequently used for fast vessels, and composite materials are often found in sailboats and pleasure craft. Some ships have been made with concrete hulls.\n### Propulsion systems\nPropulsion systems for ships fall into three categories: human propulsion, sailing, and mechanical propulsion. Human propulsion includes rowing, which was used even on large galleys. Propulsion by sail generally consists of a sail hoisted on an erect mast, supported by stays and spars and controlled by ropes. Sail systems were the dominant form of propulsion until the 19th century. They are now generally used for recreation and competition, although experimental sail systems, such as the turbosails, rotorsails, and wingsails have been used on larger modern vessels for fuel savings.\nMechanical propulsion systems generally consist of a motor or engine turning a propeller, or less frequently, an impeller or wave propulsion fins. Steam engines were first used for this purpose, but have mostly been replaced by two-stroke or four-stroke diesel engines, outboard motors, and gas turbine engines on faster ships. Nuclear reactors producing steam are used to propel warships and icebreakers, and there have been attempts to use them to power commercial vessels (see NS Savannah).\nIn addition to traditional fixed and controllable pitch propellers there are many specialized variations, such as contra-rotating and nozzle-style propellers. Most vessels have a single propeller, but some large vessels may have up to four propellers supplemented with transverse thrusters for maneuvring at ports. The propeller is connected to the main engine via a propeller shaft and, in case of medium- and high-speed engines, a reduction gearbox. Some modern vessels have a diesel-electric powertrain in which the propeller is turned by an electric motor powered by the ship's generators.\n### Steering systems\nFor ships with independent propulsion systems for each side, such as manual oars or some paddles, steering systems may not be necessary. In most designs, such as boats propelled by engines or sails, a steering system becomes necessary. The most common is a rudder, a submerged plane located at the rear of the hull. Rudders are rotated to generate a lateral force which turns the boat. Rudders can be rotated by a tiller, manual wheels, or electro-hydraulic systems. Autopilot systems combine mechanical rudders with navigation systems. Ducted propellers are sometimes used for steering.\nSome propulsion systems are inherently steering systems. Examples include the outboard motor, the bow thruster, and the Z-drive.\n### Holds, compartments, and the superstructure\nLarger boats and ships generally have multiple decks and compartments. Separate berthings and heads are found on sailboats over about 25 feet (7.6 m). Fishing boats and cargo ships typically have one or more cargo holds. Most larger vessels have an engine room, a galley, and various compartments for work. Tanks are used to store fuel, engine oil, and fresh water. Ballast tanks are equipped to change a ship's trim and modify its stability.\nSuperstructures are found above the main deck. On sailboats, these are usually very low. On modern cargo ships, they are almost always located near the ship's stern. On passenger ships and warships, the superstructure generally extends far forward.\n### Equipment\nShipboard equipment varies from ship to ship depending on such factors as the ship's era, design, area of operation, and purpose. Some types of equipment that are widely found include:\nMasts can be the home of antennas, navigation lights, radar transponders, fog signals, and similar devices often required by law. Ground tackle comprises the anchor, its chain or cable, and connecting fittings. Cargo equipment such as cranes and cargo booms may be used to load and unload cargo and ship's stores. Safety equipment such as lifeboats, liferafts, and survival suits are carried aboard many vessels for emergency use.\n## Design considerations\n### Hydrostatics\nShips float in the water at a level where mass of the displaced water equals the mass of the vessel, so that the downwards force of gravity equals the upward force of buoyancy. As a vessel is lowered into the water its weight remains constant but the corresponding weight of water displaced by its hull increases. If the vessel's mass is evenly distributed throughout, it floats evenly along its length and across its beam (width). A vessel's stability is considered in both this hydrostatic sense as well as a hydrodynamic sense, when subjected to movement, rolling and pitching, and the action of waves and wind. Stability problems can lead to excessive pitching and rolling, and eventually capsizing and sinking.\n### Hydrodynamics\nThe advance of a vessel through water is resisted by the water. This resistance can be broken down into several components, the main ones being the friction of the water on the hull and wave making resistance. To reduce resistance and therefore increase the speed for a given power, it is necessary to reduce the wetted surface and use submerged hull shapes that produce low amplitude waves. To do so, high-speed vessels are often more slender, with fewer or smaller appendages. The friction of the water is also reduced by regular maintenance of the hull to remove the sea creatures and algae that accumulate there. Antifouling paint is commonly used to assist in this. Advanced designs such as the bulbous bow assist in decreasing wave resistance.\nA simple way of considering wave-making resistance is to look at the hull in relation to its wake. At speeds lower than the wave propagation speed, the wave rapidly dissipates to the sides. As the hull approaches the wave propagation speed, however, the wake at the bow begins to build up faster than it can dissipate, and so it grows in amplitude. Since the water is not able to \"get out of the way of the hull fast enough\", the hull, in essence, has to climb over or push through the bow wave. This results in an exponential increase in resistance with increasing speed.\nThis hull speed is found by the formula:\nor, in metric units:\nwhere L is the length of the waterline in feet or meters.\nWhen the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 0.94, it starts to outrun most of its bow wave, and the hull actually settles slightly in the water as it is now only supported by two wave peaks. As the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 1.34, the hull speed, the wavelength is now longer than the hull, and the stern is no longer supported by the wake, causing the stern to squat, and the bow rise. The hull is now starting to climb its own bow wave, and resistance begins to increase at a very high rate. While it is possible to drive a displacement hull faster than a speed/length ratio of 1.34, it is prohibitively expensive to do so. Most large vessels operate at speed/length ratios well below that level, at speed/length ratios of under 1.0.\nFor large projects with adequate funding, hydrodynamic resistance can be tested experimentally in a hull testing pool or using tools of computational fluid dynamics.\nVessels are also subject to ocean surface waves and sea swell as well as effects of wind and weather. These movements can be stressful for passengers and equipment, and must be controlled if possible. The rolling movement can be controlled, to an extent, by ballasting or by devices such as fin stabilizers. Pitching movement is more difficult to limit and can be dangerous if the bow submerges in the waves, a phenomenon called pounding. Sometimes, ships must change course or speed to stop violent rolling or pitching.\n## Lifecycle\nA ship will pass through several stages during its career. The first is usually an initial contract to build the ship, the details of which can vary widely based on relationships between the shipowners, operators, designers and the shipyard. Then, the design phase carried out by a naval architect. Then the ship is constructed in a shipyard. After construction, the vessel is launched and goes into service. Ships end their careers in a number of ways, ranging from shipwrecks to service as a museum ship to the scrapyard.\n### Design\nA vessel's design starts with a specification, which a naval architect uses to create a project outline, assess required dimensions, and create a basic layout of spaces and a rough displacement. After this initial rough draft, the architect can create an initial hull design, a general profile and an initial overview of the ship's propulsion. At this stage, the designer can iterate on the ship's design, adding detail and refining the design at each stage.\nThe designer will typically produce an overall plan, a general specification describing the peculiarities of the vessel, and construction blueprints to be used at the building site. Designs for larger or more complex vessels may also include sail plans, electrical schematics, and plumbing and ventilation plans.\nAs environmental laws are becoming more strict, ship designers need to create their design in such a way that the ship, when it nears its end-of-term, can be disassembled or disposed easily and that waste is reduced to a minimum.\n### Construction\nShip construction takes place in a shipyard, and can last from a few months for a unit produced in series, to several years to reconstruct a wooden boat like the frigate Hermione, to more than 10 years for an aircraft carrier. During World War II, the need for cargo ships was so urgent that construction time for Liberty Ships went from initially eight months or longer, down to weeks or even days. Builders employed production line and prefabrication techniques such as those used in shipyards today.\nHull materials and vessel size play a large part in determining the method of construction. The hull of a mass-produced fiberglass sailboat is constructed from a mold, while the steel hull of a cargo ship is made from large sections welded together as they are built.\nGenerally, construction starts with the hull, and on vessels over about 30 meters (98 ft), by the laying of the keel. This is done in a drydock or on land. Once the hull is assembled and painted, it is launched. The last stages, such as raising the superstructure and adding equipment and accommodation, can be done after the vessel is afloat.\nOnce completed, the vessel is delivered to the customer. Ship launching is often a ceremony of some significance, and is usually when the vessel is formally named. A typical small rowboat can cost under US$100, $1,000 for a small speedboat, tens of thousands of dollars for a cruising sailboat, and about $2,000,000 for a Vendée Globe class sailboat. A 25 meters (82 ft) trawler may cost $2.5 million, and a 1,000-person-capacity high-speed passenger ferry can cost in the neighborhood of $50 million. A ship's cost partly depends on its complexity: a small, general cargo ship will cost $20 million, a Panamax-sized bulk carrier around $35 million, a supertanker around $105 million and a large LNG carrier nearly $200 million. The most expensive ships generally are so because of the cost of embedded electronics: a Seawolf-class submarine costs around $2 billion, and an aircraft carrier goes for about $3.5 billion.\n### Repair and conversion\nShips undergo nearly constant maintenance during their career, whether they be underway, pierside, or in some cases, in periods of reduced operating status between charters or shipping seasons.\nMost ships, however, require trips to special facilities such as a drydock at regular intervals. Tasks often done at drydock include removing biological growths on the hull, sandblasting and repainting the hull, and replacing sacrificial anodes used to protect submerged equipment from corrosion. Major repairs to the propulsion and steering systems as well as major electrical systems are also often performed at dry dock.\nSome vessels that sustain major damage at sea may be repaired at a facility equipped for major repairs, such as a shipyard. Ships may also be converted for a new purpose: oil tankers are often converted into floating production storage and offloading units.\n### End of service\nMost ocean-going cargo ships have a life expectancy of between 20 and 30 years. A sailboat made of plywood or fiberglass can last between 30 and 40 years. Solid wooden ships can last much longer but require regular maintenance. Carefully maintained steel-hulled yachts can have a lifespan of over 100 years.\nAs ships age, forces such as corrosion, osmosis, and rotting compromise hull strength, and a vessel becomes too dangerous to sail. At this point, it can be scuttled at sea or scrapped by shipbreakers. Ships can also be used as museum ships, or expended to construct breakwaters or artificial reefs.\nMany ships do not make it to the scrapyard, and are lost in fires, collisions, grounding, or sinking at sea. The Allies lost some 5,150 ships during World War II.\n## Measuring ships\nOne can measure ships in terms of length overall, length between perpendiculars, length of the ship at the waterline, beam (breadth), depth (distance between the crown of the weather deck and the top of the keelson), draft (distance between the highest waterline and the bottom of the ship) and tonnage. A number of different tonnage definitions exist and are used when describing merchant ships for the purpose of tolls, taxation, etc.\nIn Britain until Samuel Plimsoll's Merchant Shipping Act of 1876, ship-owners could load their vessels until their decks were almost awash, resulting in a dangerously unstable condition. Anyone who signed on to such a ship for a voyage and, upon realizing the danger, chose to leave the ship, could end up in jail. Plimsoll, a Member of Parliament, realised the problem and engaged some engineers to derive a fairly simple formula to determine the position of a line on the side of any specific ship's hull which, when it reached the surface of the water during loading of cargo, meant the ship had reached its maximum safe loading level. To this day, that mark, called the \"Plimsoll Line\", exists on ships' sides, and consists of a circle with a horizontal line through the centre. On the Great Lakes of North America the circle is replaced with a diamond. Because different types of water (summer, fresh, tropical fresh, winter north Atlantic) have different densities, subsequent regulations required painting a group of lines forward of the Plimsoll mark to indicate the safe depth (or freeboard above the surface) to which a specific ship could load in water of various densities. Hence the \"ladder\" of lines seen forward of the Plimsoll mark to this day. This is called the \"freeboard mark\" or \"load line mark\" in the marine industry.\n## Ship pollution\nShip pollution is the pollution of air and water by shipping. It is a problem that has been accelerating as trade has become increasingly globalized, posing an increasing threat to the world's oceans and waterways as globalization continues. It is expected that \"shipping traffic to and from the United States is projected to double by 2020.\" Because of increased traffic in ocean ports, pollution from ships also directly affects coastal areas. The pollution produced affects biodiversity, climate, food, and human health. However, the degree to which humans are polluting and how it affects the world is highly debated and has been a hot international topic for the past 30 years.\n### Oil spills\nOil spills have devastating effects on the environment. Crude oil contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are very difficult to clean up, and last for years in the sediment and marine environment. Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles.\nBy the sheer amount of oil carried, modern oil tankers must be considered something of a threat to the environment. An oil tanker can carry 2 million barrels (318,000 m3) of crude oil, or 84,000,000 US gallons (69,940,000 imp gal; 318,000,000 L). This is more than six times the amount spilled in the widely known Exxon Valdez incident. In this spill, the ship ran aground and dumped 10,800,000 US gallons (8,993,000 imp gal; 40,880,000 L) of oil into the ocean in March 1989. Despite efforts of scientists, managers, and volunteers, over 400,000 seabirds, about 1,000 sea otters, and immense numbers of fish were killed.\nThe International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation has researched 9,351 accidental spills since 1974. According to this study, most spills result from routine operations such as loading cargo, discharging cargo, and taking on fuel oil. 91% of the operational oil spills were small, resulting in less than 7 tons per spill. Spills resulting from accidents like collisions, groundings, hull failures, and explosions are much larger, with 84% of these involving losses of over 700 tons.\nFollowing the Exxon Valdez spill, the United States passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90), which included a stipulation that all tankers entering its waters be double-hulled by 2015. Following the sinkings of Erika (1999) and Prestige (2002), the European Union passed its own stringent anti-pollution packages (known as Erika I, II, and III), which require all tankers entering its waters to be double-hulled by 2010. The Erika packages are controversial because they introduced the new legal concept of \"serious negligence\".\n### Ballast water\nWhen a large vessel such as a container ship or an oil tanker unloads cargo, seawater is pumped into other compartments in the hull to help stabilize and balance the ship. During loading, this ballast water is pumped out from these compartments.\nOne of the problems with ballast water transfer is the transport of harmful organisms. Meinesz believes that one of the worst cases of a single invasive species causing harm to an ecosystem can be attributed to a seemingly harmless planktonic organism . Mnemiopsis leidyi, a species of comb jelly that inhabits estuaries from the United States to the Valdés peninsula in Argentina along the Atlantic coast, has caused notable damage in the Black Sea. It was first introduced in 1982, and thought to have been transported to the Black Sea in a ship's ballast water. The population of the comb jelly shot up exponentially and, by 1988, it was wreaking havoc upon the local fishing industry. \"The anchovy catch fell from 204,000 tonnes (225,000 short tons; 201,000 long tons) in 1984 to 200 tonnes (220 short tons; 197 long tons) in 1993; sprat from 24,600 tonnes (27,100 short tons; 24,200 long tons) in 1984 to 12,000 tonnes (13,200 short tons; 11,800 long tons) in 1993; horse mackerel from 4,000 tonnes (4,410 short tons; 3,940 long tons) in 1984 to zero in 1993.\" Now that the comb jellies have exhausted the zooplankton, including fish larvae, their numbers have fallen dramatically, yet they continue to maintain a stranglehold on the ecosystem. Recently the comb jellies have been discovered in the Caspian Sea. Invasive species can take over once occupied areas, facilitate the spread of new diseases, introduce new genetic material, alter landscapes and jeopardize the ability of native species to obtain food. \"On land and in the sea, invasive species are responsible for about 137 billion dollars in lost revenue and management costs in the U.S. each year.\"\nBallast and bilge discharge from ships can also spread human pathogens and other harmful diseases and toxins potentially causing health issues for humans and marine life alike. Discharges into coastal waters, along with other sources of marine pollution, have the potential to be toxic to marine plants, animals, and microorganisms, causing alterations such as changes in growth, disruption of hormone cycles, birth defects, suppression of the immune system, and disorders resulting in cancer, tumors, and genetic abnormalities or even death.\n### Exhaust emissions\nExhaust emissions from ships are considered to be a significant source of air pollution. \"Seagoing vessels are responsible for an estimated 14 percent of emissions of nitrogen from fossil fuels and 16 percent of the emissions of sulfur from petroleum uses into the atmosphere.\" In Europe ships make up a large percentage of the sulfur introduced to the air, \"as much sulfur as all the cars, lorries and factories in Europe put together\". \"By 2010, up to 40% of air pollution over land could come from ships.\" Sulfur in the air creates acid rain which damages crops and buildings. When inhaled, sulfur is known to cause respiratory problems and increase the risk of a heart attack.\n### Ship breaking\nShip breaking or ship demolition is a type of ship disposal involving the breaking up of ships for scrap recycling, with the hulls being discarded in ship graveyards. Most ships have a lifespan of a few decades before there is so much wear that refitting and repair becomes uneconomical. Ship breaking allows materials from the ship, especially steel, to be reused.\nIn addition to steel and other useful materials, however, ships (particularly older vessels) can contain many substances that are banned or considered dangerous in developed countries. Asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are typical examples. Asbestos was used heavily in ship construction until it was finally banned in most of the developed world in the mid 1980s. Currently, the costs associated with removing asbestos, along with the potentially expensive insurance and health risks, have meant that ship-breaking in most developed countries is no longer economically viable. Removing the metal for scrap can potentially cost more than the scrap value of the metal itself. In most of the developing world, however, shipyards can operate without the risk of personal injury lawsuits or workers' health claims, meaning many of these shipyards may operate with high health risks. Furthermore, workers are paid very low rates with no overtime or other allowances. Protective equipment is sometimes absent or inadequate. Dangerous vapors and fumes from burning materials can be inhaled, and dusty asbestos-laden areas around such breakdown locations are commonplace.\nAside from the health of the yard workers, in recent years, ship breaking has also become an issue of major environmental concern. Many developing nations, in which ship breaking yards are located, have lax or no environmental law, enabling large quantities of highly toxic materials to escape into the environment and causing serious health problems among ship breakers, the local population and wildlife. Environmental campaign groups such as Greenpeace have made the issue a high priority for their campaigns.", "ship, any large floating vessel capable of crossing open waters, as opposed to a boat, which is generally a smaller craft. The term formerly was applied to sailing vessels having three or more masts; in modern times it usually denotes a vessel of more than 500 tons of displacement. Submersible ships are generally called boats regardless of their size. ## Naval architecture\nThe design of ships employs many technologies and branches of engineering that also are found ashore, but the imperatives of effective and safe operation at sea require oversight from a unique discipline. That discipline is properly called marine engineering, but the term naval architecture is familiarly used in the same sense. In this section the latter term is used to denote the hydrostatic and aesthetic aspects of marine engineering.\nterms used in ship designThe measurements of ships are given in terms of length, breadth, and depth. The length between perpendiculars is the distance on the summer (maximum) load waterline, from the forward side of the stem at the extreme forward part of the vessel to the after side of the rudder post at the extreme rear, or to the centre of the rudder stock, if there is no rudder post. The beam is the greatest breadth of the ship. The depth is measured at the middle of the length, from the top of the keel to the top of the deck beam at the side of the uppermost continuous deck. Draft is measured from the keel to the waterline, while freeboard is measured from the waterline to the deck edge. These terms, together with several others of importance in ship design, are given in the figure.\n## Hydrostatics\nThe basis of naval architecture is found in Archimedes’ principle, which states that the weight of a statically floating body must equal the weight of the volume of water that it displaces. This law of buoyancy determines not only the draft at which a vessel will float but also the angles that it will assume when in equilibrium with the water.\nA ship may be designed to carry a specified weight of cargo, plus such necessary supplies as fuel, lubricating oil, crew, and the crew’s life support). These combine to form a total known as deadweight. To deadweight must be added the weight of the ship’s structure, propulsion machinery, hull engineering (nonpropulsive machinery), and outfit (fixed items having to do with crew life support). These categories of weight are known collectively as lightship weight. The sum of deadweight and lightship weight is displacement—that is, the weight that must be equaled by the weight of displaced water if the ship is to float. Of course, the volume of water displaced by a ship is a function of the size of that ship, but in turn the weight of water that is to be matched by displacement is also a function of the ship’s size. The early stages of ship design, therefore, are a struggle to predict the size of the ship that the sum of all weights will require. The naval architect’s resources include experience-based formulas that provide approximate values for making such predictions. Subsequent refinements usually produce accurate predictions of the ship’s draft—that is, the depth of water in which the finished ship will float.\nIn some cases a ship may be intended for cargo of such a high stowage factor (i.e., volume per weight unit) that providing for the required internal volume is more of a problem than providing for a specific deadweight. Nevertheless, the problem of designing for a displacement that matches the weight of the ship is essentially the same.\n## Static stability\nAccurately predicting a ship’s draft is a necessary result of correctly applied hydrostatic principles but is far from sufficient. If the many items of weight on a ship are not distributed with considerable precision, the ship will float at unwanted angles of heel (sideways inclination) and trim (endwise inclination). Nonzero trim angles may lift the tips of propeller blades above the surface, or they may increase the possibility that the bow will slam into waves during heavy weather. Nonzero heel angles (which tend to be much greater than trim angles) may make all human activity aboard difficult; moreover, they are dangerous because they reduce the margin against capsizing. In general, the avoidance of such inclinations requires an extension of Archimedes’ principle to the first moments of weights and volumes: the collective first moment of all weights must equal the first weight moment of the water displaced.\nstatic stability of a shipThe figure shows the cross section of a ship that is floating at heel angle θ, caused by the placement of a weight (w) a certain distance (d) from the centre line. At this angle, the upsetting moment, calculated as w × d × cos θ, is equaled by the righting moment Δ × GZ, (Δ is the symbol for displacement, and GZ is the distance from the centre of gravity [G] to the centre of buoyancy [Z]). Under these conditions, the ship is said to be in static equilibrium. If w is removed, the upsetting moment will become zero, and the righting moment will return the ship to its upright position. The ship is therefore judged to be stable. The moment will act in the stable direction only as long as the point M (the “metacentre,” the point where the buoyant force intersects the midplane) is above G (the centre of gravity of the ship and its contents). If M is below G, the forces of weight and buoyancy will tend to increase the angle of heel, and the equilibrium will be unstable. The distance from G to M, taken to be positive if M is above G, is called the transverse metacentric height.\nA value for metacentric height is usually found only for the zero heel condition; hence, it is an accurate measure of stability only for small disturbances—for example, ones that cause heeling of no more than about 10°. For larger angles, the “righting arm,” GZ, is used to measure stability. In any stability analysis, the value of GZ is plotted over the entire range of heel angles for which it is positive, or restoring. The resultant curve of statical stability shows thereby the angle beyond which the ship cannot return to upright and the angle at which the restoring moment is at a maximum. The area of the curve between its origin and any specified angle is proportional to the energy required to heel the ship to that angle.\n## Hydrostatics\nThe basis of naval architecture is found in Archimedes’ principle, which states that the weight of a statically floating body must equal the weight of the volume of water that it displaces. This law of buoyancy determines not only the draft at which a vessel will float but also the angles that it will assume when in equilibrium with the water.\nA ship may be designed to carry a specified weight of cargo, plus such necessary supplies as fuel, lubricating oil, crew, and the crew’s life support). These combine to form a total known as deadweight. To deadweight must be added the weight of the ship’s structure, propulsion machinery, hull engineering (nonpropulsive machinery), and outfit (fixed items having to do with crew life support). These categories of weight are known collectively as lightship weight. The sum of deadweight and lightship weight is displacement—that is, the weight that must be equaled by the weight of displaced water if the ship is to float. Of course, the volume of water displaced by a ship is a function of the size of that ship, but in turn the weight of water that is to be matched by displacement is also a function of the ship’s size. The early stages of ship design, therefore, are a struggle to predict the size of the ship that the sum of all weights will require. The naval architect’s resources include experience-based formulas that provide approximate values for making such predictions. Subsequent refinements usually produce accurate predictions of the ship’s draft—that is, the depth of water in which the finished ship will float.\nIn some cases a ship may be intended for cargo of such a high stowage factor (i.e., volume per weight unit) that providing for the required internal volume is more of a problem than providing for a specific deadweight. Nevertheless, the problem of designing for a displacement that matches the weight of the ship is essentially the same.\n## Static stability\nAccurately predicting a ship’s draft is a necessary result of correctly applied hydrostatic principles but is far from sufficient. If the many items of weight on a ship are not distributed with considerable precision, the ship will float at unwanted angles of heel (sideways inclination) and trim (endwise inclination). Nonzero trim angles may lift the tips of propeller blades above the surface, or they may increase the possibility that the bow will slam into waves during heavy weather. Nonzero heel angles (which tend to be much greater than trim angles) may make all human activity aboard difficult; moreover, they are dangerous because they reduce the margin against capsizing. In general, the avoidance of such inclinations requires an extension of Archimedes’ principle to the first moments of weights and volumes: the collective first moment of all weights must equal the first weight moment of the water displaced.\nstatic stability of a shipThe figure shows the cross section of a ship that is floating at heel angle θ, caused by the placement of a weight (w) a certain distance (d) from the centre line. At this angle, the upsetting moment, calculated as w × d × cos θ, is equaled by the righting moment Δ × GZ, (Δ is the symbol for displacement, and GZ is the distance from the centre of gravity [G] to the centre of buoyancy [Z]). Under these conditions, the ship is said to be in static equilibrium. If w is removed, the upsetting moment will become zero, and the righting moment will return the ship to its upright position. The ship is therefore judged to be stable. The moment will act in the stable direction only as long as the point M (the “metacentre,” the point where the buoyant force intersects the midplane) is above G (the centre of gravity of the ship and its contents). If M is below G, the forces of weight and buoyancy will tend to increase the angle of heel, and the equilibrium will be unstable. The distance from G to M, taken to be positive if M is above G, is called the transverse metacentric height.\nA value for metacentric height is usually found only for the zero heel condition; hence, it is an accurate measure of stability only for small disturbances—for example, ones that cause heeling of no more than about 10°. For larger angles, the “righting arm,” GZ, is used to measure stability. In any stability analysis, the value of GZ is plotted over the entire range of heel angles for which it is positive, or restoring. The resultant curve of statical stability shows thereby the angle beyond which the ship cannot return to upright and the angle at which the restoring moment is at a maximum. The area of the curve between its origin and any specified angle is proportional to the energy required to heel the ship to that angle.\n## Static stability\nAccurately predicting a ship’s draft is a necessary result of correctly applied hydrostatic principles but is far from sufficient.

{"name": "Human digestive system", "documents": ["human digestive system, system used in the human body for the process of digestion. The human digestive system consists primarily of the digestive tract, or the series of structures and organs through which food and liquids pass during their processing into forms absorbable into the bloodstream. The system also consists of the structures through which wastes pass in the process of elimination and other organs that contribute juices necessary for the digestive process. ## Structures and functions of the human digestive system\nabdominal organsThe digestive tract begins at the lips and ends at the anus. It consists of the mouth, or oral cavity, with its teeth, for grinding the food, and its tongue, which serves to knead food and mix it with saliva; the throat, or pharynx; the esophagus; the stomach; the small intestine, consisting of the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum; and the large intestine, consisting of the cecum, a closed-end sac connecting with the ileum, the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon, which terminates in the rectum. Glands contributing digestive juices include the salivary glands, the gastric glands in the stomach lining, the pancreas, and the liver and its adjuncts—the gallbladder and bile ducts. All of these organs and glands contribute to the physical and chemical breaking down of ingested food and to the eventual elimination of nondigestible wastes. Their structures and functions are described step by step in this section.\n## Mouth and oral structures\nhuman mouthLittle digestion of food actually takes place in the mouth. However, through the process of mastication, or chewing, food is prepared in the mouth for transport through the upper digestive tract into the stomach and small intestine, where the principal digestive processes take place. Chewing is the first mechanical process to which food is subjected. Movements of the lower jaw in chewing are brought about by the muscles of mastication (the masseter, the temporal, the medial and lateral pterygoids, and the buccinator). The sensitivity of the periodontal membrane that surrounds and supports the teeth, rather than the power of the muscles of mastication, determines the force of the bite.\nMastication is not essential for adequate digestion. Chewing does aid digestion, however, by reducing food to small particles and mixing it with the saliva secreted by the salivary glands. The saliva lubricates and moistens dry food, while chewing distributes the saliva throughout the food mass. The movement of the tongue against the hard palate and the cheeks helps to form a rounded mass, or bolus, of food.\n## The lips and cheeks\nThe lips, two fleshy folds that surround the mouth, are composed externally of skin and internally of mucous membrane, or mucosa. The mucosa is rich in mucus-secreting glands, which together with saliva ensure adequate lubrication for the purposes of speech and mastication.\nThe cheeks, the sides of the mouth, are continuous with the lips and have a similar structure. A distinct fat pad is found in the subcutaneous tissue (the tissue beneath the skin) of the cheek; this pad is especially large in infants and is known as the sucking pad. On the inner surface of each cheek, opposite the second upper molar tooth, is a slight elevation that marks the opening of the parotid duct, leading from the parotid salivary gland, which is located in front of the ear. Just behind this gland are four to five mucus-secreting glands, the ducts of which open opposite the last molar tooth.\n## The roof of the mouth\nThe roof of the mouth is concave and is formed by the hard and soft palate. The hard palate is formed by the horizontal portions of the two palatine bones and the palatine portions of the maxillae, or upper jaws. The hard palate is covered by a thick, somewhat pale mucous membrane that is continuous with that of the gums and is bound to the upper jaw and palate bones by firm fibrous tissue. The soft palate is continuous with the hard palate in front. Posteriorly it is continuous with the mucous membrane covering the floor of the nasal cavity. The soft palate is composed of a strong, thin, fibrous sheet, the palatine aponeurosis, and the glossopalatine and pharyngopalatine muscles. A small projection called the uvula hangs free from the posterior of the soft palate.\n## The floor of the mouth\nThe floor of the mouth can be seen only when the tongue is raised. In the midline is a prominent, elevated fold of mucous membrane (frenulum linguae) that binds each lip to the gums, and on each side of this is a slight fold called a sublingual papilla, from which the ducts of the submandibular salivary glands open. Running outward and backward from each sublingual papilla is a ridge (the plica sublingualis) that marks the upper edge of the sublingual (under the tongue) salivary gland and onto which most of the ducts of that gland open.\n## The gums\nThe gums consist of mucous membranes connected by thick fibrous tissue to the membrane surrounding the bones of the jaw. The gum membrane rises to form a collar around the base of the crown (exposed portion) of each tooth. Rich in blood vessels, the gum tissues receive branches from the alveolar arteries; these vessels, called alveolar because of their relationship to the alveoli dentales, or tooth sockets, also supply the teeth and the spongy bone of the upper and lower jaws, in which the teeth are lodged.\n## Mouth and oral structures\nhuman mouthLittle digestion of food actually takes place in the mouth.

Digestion involves the breakdown of food into smaller and smaller components, until they can be absorbed and assimilated into the body. The process of digestion has three stages: the cephalic phase, the gastric phase, and the intestinal phase.\nThe first stage, the cephalic phase of digestion, begins with secretions from gastric glands in response to the sight and smell of food. This stage includes the mechanical breakdown of food by chewing, and the chemical breakdown by digestive enzymes, that takes place in the mouth. Saliva contains the digestive enzymes amylase, and lingual lipase, secreted by the salivary and serous glands on the tongue. Chewing, in which the food is mixed with saliva, begins the mechanical process of digestion. This produces a bolus which is swallowed down the esophagus to enter the stomach.\nThe second stage of digestion begins in the stomach with the gastric phase. Here the food is further broken down by mixing with gastric acid until it passes into the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine.\nThe third stage begins in the duodenum with the intestinal phase, where partially digested food is mixed with a number of enzymes produced by the pancreas. Digestion is helped by the chewing of food carried out by the muscles of mastication, the tongue, and the teeth, and also by the contractions of peristalsis, and segmentation. Gastric acid, and the production of mucus in the stomach, are essential for the continuation of digestion.\nPeristalsis is the rhythmic contraction of muscles that begins in the esophagus and continues along the wall of the stomach and the rest of the gastrointestinal tract. This initially results in the production of chyme which when fully broken down in the small intestine is absorbed as chyle into the lymphatic system. Most of the digestion of food takes place in the small intestine. Water and some minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon of the large intestine. The waste products of digestion (feces) are defecated from the rectum via the anus.\n## Components\nThere are several organs and other components involved in the digestion of food. The organs known as the accessory digestive organs are the liver, gall bladder and pancreas. Other components include the mouth, salivary glands, tongue, teeth and epiglottis.\nThe largest structure of the digestive system is the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). This starts at the mouth and ends at the anus, covering a distance of about nine metres.\nA major digestive organ is the stomach. Within its mucosa are millions of embedded gastric glands. Their secretions are vital to the functioning of the organ.\nMost of the digestion of food takes place in the small intestine which is the longest part of the GI tract.\nThe largest part of the GI tract is the colon or large intestine. Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste matter is stored prior to defecation.\nThere are many specialised cells of the GI tract. These include the various cells of the gastric glands, taste cells, pancreatic duct cells, enterocytes and microfold cells.\nSome parts of the digestive system are also part of the excretory system, including the large intestine.\n### Mouth\nThe mouth is the first part of the upper gastrointestinal tract and is equipped with several structures that begin the first processes of digestion. These include salivary glands, teeth and the tongue. The mouth consists of two regions; the vestibule and the oral cavity proper. The vestibule is the area between the teeth, lips and cheeks, and the rest is the oral cavity proper. Most of the oral cavity is lined with oral mucosa, a mucous membrane that produces a lubricating mucus, of which only a small amount is needed. Mucous membranes vary in structure in the different regions of the body but they all produce a lubricating mucus, which is either secreted by surface cells or more usually by underlying glands. The mucous membrane in the mouth continues as the thin mucosa which lines the bases of the teeth. The main component of mucus is a glycoprotein called mucin and the type secreted varies according to the region involved. Mucin is viscous, clear, and clinging. Underlying the mucous membrane in the mouth is a thin layer of smooth muscle tissue and the loose connection to the membrane gives it its great elasticity. It covers the cheeks, inner surfaces of the lips, and floor of the mouth, and the mucin produced is highly protective against tooth decay.\nThe roof of the mouth is termed the palate and it separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity. The palate is hard at the front of the mouth since the overlying mucosa is covering a plate of bone; it is softer and more pliable at the back being made of muscle and connective tissue, and it can move to swallow food and liquids. The soft palate ends at the uvula. The surface of the hard palate allows for the pressure needed in eating food, to leave the nasal passage clear. The opening between the lips is termed the oral fissure, and the opening into the throat is called the fauces.\nAt either side of the soft palate are the palatoglossus muscles which also reach into regions of the tongue. These muscles raise the back of the tongue and also close both sides of the fauces to enable food to be swallowed.: 1208  Mucus helps in the mastication of food in its ability to soften and collect the food in the formation of the bolus.\n#### Salivary glands\nThere are three pairs of main salivary glands and between 800 and 1,000 minor salivary glands, all of which mainly serve the digestive process, and also play an important role in the maintenance of dental health and general mouth lubrication, without which speech would be impossible. The main glands are all exocrine glands, secreting via ducts. All of these glands terminate in the mouth. The largest of these are the parotid glands—their secretion is mainly serous. The next pair are underneath the jaw, the submandibular glands, these produce both serous fluid and mucus. The serous fluid is produced by serous glands in these salivary glands which also produce lingual lipase. They produce about 70% of the oral cavity saliva. The third pair are the sublingual glands located underneath the tongue and their secretion is mainly mucous with a small percentage of saliva.\nWithin the oral mucosa, and also on the tongue, palates, and floor of the mouth, are the minor salivary glands; their secretions are mainly mucous and they are innervated by the facial nerve (CN7). The glands also secrete amylase a first stage in the breakdown of food acting on the carbohydrate in the food to transform the starch content into maltose. There are other serous glands on the surface of the tongue that encircle taste buds on the back part of the tongue and these also produce lingual lipase. Lipase is a digestive enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of lipids (fats). These glands are termed Von Ebner's glands which have also been shown to have another function in the secretion of histatins which offer an early defense (outside of the immune system) against microbes in food, when it makes contact with these glands on the tongue tissue. Sensory information can stimulate the secretion of saliva providing the necessary fluid for the tongue to work with and also to ease swallowing of the food.\n##### Saliva\nSaliva moistens and softens food, and along with the chewing action of the teeth, transforms the food into a smooth bolus. The bolus is further helped by the lubrication provided by the saliva in its passage from the mouth into the esophagus. Also of importance is the presence in saliva of the digestive enzymes amylase and lipase. Amylase starts to work on the starch in carbohydrates, breaking it down into the simple sugars of maltose and dextrose that can be further broken down in the small intestine. Saliva in the mouth can account for 30% of this initial starch digestion. Lipase starts to work on breaking down fats. Lipase is further produced in the pancreas where it is released to continue this digestion of fats. The presence of salivary lipase is of prime importance in young babies whose pancreatic lipase has yet to be developed.\nAs well as its role in supplying digestive enzymes, saliva has a cleansing action for the teeth and mouth. It also has an immunological role in supplying antibodies to the system, such as immunoglobulin A. This is seen to be key in preventing infections of the salivary glands, importantly that of parotitis.\nSaliva also contains a glycoprotein called haptocorrin which is a binding protein to vitamin B12. It binds with the vitamin in order to carry it safely through the acidic content of the stomach. When it reaches the duodenum, pancreatic enzymes break down the glycoprotein and free the vitamin which then binds with intrinsic factor.\n#### Tongue\nFood enters the mouth where the first stage in the digestive process takes place, with the action of the tongue and the secretion of saliva. The tongue is a fleshy and muscular sensory organ, and the first sensory information is received via the taste buds in the papillae on its surface. If the taste is agreeable, the tongue will go into action, manipulating the food in the mouth which stimulates the secretion of saliva from the salivary glands. The liquid quality of the saliva will help in the softening of the food and its enzyme content will start to break down the food whilst it is still in the mouth. The first part of the food to be broken down is the starch of carbohydrates (by the enzyme amylase in the saliva).\nThe tongue is attached to the floor of the mouth by a ligamentous band called the frenum and this gives it great mobility for the manipulation of food (and speech); the range of manipulation is optimally controlled by the action of several muscles and limited in its external range by the stretch of the frenum. The tongue's two sets of muscles, are four intrinsic muscles that originate in the tongue and are involved with its shaping, and four extrinsic muscles originating in bone that are involved with its movement.\n##### Taste\nTaste is a form of chemoreception that takes place in the specialised taste receptors, contained in structures called taste buds in the mouth. Taste buds are mainly on the upper surface (dorsum) of the tongue. The function of taste perception is vital to help prevent harmful or rotten foods from being consumed. There are also taste buds on the epiglottis and upper part of the esophagus. The taste buds are innervated by a branch of the facial nerve the chorda tympani, and the glossopharyngeal nerve. Taste messages are sent via these cranial nerves to the brain. The brain can distinguish between the chemical qualities of the food. The five basic tastes are referred to as those of saltiness, sourness, bitterness, sweetness, and umami. The detection of saltiness and sourness enables the control of salt and acid balance. The detection of bitterness warns of poisons—many of a plant's defences are of poisonous compounds that are bitter. Sweetness guides to those foods that will supply energy; the initial breakdown of the energy-giving carbohydrates by salivary amylase creates the taste of sweetness since simple sugars are the first result. The taste of umami is thought to signal protein-rich food. Sour tastes are acidic which is often found in bad food. The brain has to decide very quickly whether the food should be eaten or not. It was the findings in 1991, describing the first olfactory receptors that helped to prompt the research into taste. The olfactory receptors are located on cell surfaces in the nose which bind to chemicals enabling the detection of smells. It is assumed that signals from taste receptors work together with those from the nose, to form an idea of complex food flavours.\n#### Teeth\nTeeth are complex structures made of materials specific to them. They are made of a bone-like material called dentin, which is covered by the hardest tissue in the body—enamel. Teeth have different shapes to deal with different aspects of mastication employed in tearing and chewing pieces of food into smaller and smaller pieces. This results in a much larger surface area for the action of digestive enzymes. The teeth are named after their particular roles in the process of mastication—incisors are used for cutting or biting off pieces of food; canines, are used for tearing, premolars and molars are used for chewing and grinding. Mastication of the food with the help of saliva and mucus results in the formation of a soft bolus which can then be swallowed to make its way down the upper gastrointestinal tract to the stomach. The digestive enzymes in saliva also help in keeping the teeth clean by breaking down any lodged food particles.\n#### Epiglottis\nThe epiglottis is a flap of elastic cartilage attached to the entrance of the larynx. It is covered with a mucous membrane and there are taste buds on its lingual surface which faces into the mouth. Its laryngeal surface faces into the larynx. The epiglottis functions to guard the entrance of the glottis, the opening between the vocal folds. It is normally pointed upward during breathing with its underside functioning as part of the pharynx, but during swallowing, the epiglottis folds down to a more horizontal position, with its upper side functioning as part of the pharynx. In this manner it prevents food from going into the trachea and instead directs it to the esophagus, which is behind. During swallowing, the backward motion of the tongue forces the epiglottis over the glottis' opening to prevent any food that is being swallowed from entering the larynx which leads to the lungs; the larynx is also pulled upwards to assist this process. Stimulation of the larynx by ingested matter produces a strong cough reflex in order to protect the lungs.\n### Pharynx\nThe pharynx is a part of the conducting zone of the respiratory system and also a part of the digestive system. It is the part of the throat immediately behind the nasal cavity at the back of the mouth and above the esophagus and larynx. The pharynx is made up of three parts. The lower two parts—the oropharynx and the laryngopharynx are involved in the digestive system. The laryngopharynx connects to the esophagus and it serves as a passageway for both air and food. Air enters the larynx anteriorly but anything swallowed has priority and the passage of air is temporarily blocked. The pharynx is innervated by the pharyngeal plexus of the vagus nerve.: 1465  Muscles in the pharynx push the food into the esophagus. The pharynx joins the esophagus at the oesophageal inlet which is located behind the cricoid cartilage.\n### Esophagus\nThe esophagus, commonly known as the foodpipe or gullet, consists of a muscular tube through which food passes from the pharynx to the stomach. The esophagus is continuous with the laryngopharynx. It passes through the posterior mediastinum in the thorax and enters the stomach through a hole in the thoracic diaphragm—the esophageal hiatus, at the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra (T10). Its length averages 25 cm, varying with an individual's height. It is divided into cervical, thoracic and abdominal parts. The pharynx joins the esophagus at the esophageal inlet which is behind the cricoid cartilage.\nAt rest the esophagus is closed at both ends, by the upper and lower esophageal sphincters. The opening of the upper sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex so that food is allowed through. The sphincter also serves to prevent back flow from the esophagus into the pharynx. The esophagus has a mucous membrane and the epithelium which has a protective function is continuously replaced due to the volume of food that passes inside the esophagus. During swallowing, food passes from the mouth through the pharynx into the esophagus. The epiglottis folds down to a more horizontal position to direct the food into the esophagus, and away from the trachea.\nOnce in the esophagus, the bolus travels down to the stomach via rhythmic contraction and relaxation of muscles known as peristalsis. The lower esophageal sphincter is a muscular sphincter surrounding the lower part of the esophagus. The gastroesophageal junction between the esophagus and the stomach is controlled by the lower esophageal sphincter, which remains constricted at all times other than during swallowing and vomiting to prevent the contents of the stomach from entering the esophagus. As the esophagus does not have the same protection from acid as the stomach, any failure of this sphincter can lead to heartburn.\n### Diaphragm\nThe diaphragm is an important part of the body's digestive system. The muscular diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity where most of the digestive organs are located. The suspensory muscle attaches the ascending duodenum to the diaphragm. This muscle is thought to be of help in the digestive system in that its attachment offers a wider angle to the duodenojejunal flexure for the easier passage of digesting material. The diaphragm also attaches to, and anchors the liver at its bare area. The esophagus enters the abdomen through a hole in the diaphragm at the level of T10.\n### Stomach\nThe stomach is a major organ of the gastrointestinal tract and digestive system. It is a consistently J-shaped organ joined to the esophagus at its upper end and to the duodenum at its lower end. Gastric acid (informally gastric juice), produced in the stomach plays a vital role in the digestive process, and mainly contains hydrochloric acid and sodium chloride. A peptide hormone, gastrin, produced by G cells in the gastric glands, stimulates the production of gastric juice which activates the digestive enzymes. Pepsinogen is a precursor enzyme (zymogen) produced by the gastric chief cells, and gastric acid activates this to the enzyme pepsin which begins the digestion of proteins. As these two chemicals would damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by innumerable gastric glands in the stomach, to provide a slimy protective layer against the damaging effects of the chemicals on the inner layers of the stomach.\nAt the same time that protein is being digested, mechanical churning occurs through the action of peristalsis, waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes. Gastric lipase secreted by the chief cells in the fundic glands in the gastric mucosa of the stomach, is an acidic lipase, in contrast with the alkaline pancreatic lipase. This breaks down fats to some degree though is not as efficient as the pancreatic lipase.\nThe pylorus, the lowest section of the stomach which attaches to the duodenum via the pyloric canal, contains countless glands which secrete digestive enzymes including gastrin. After an hour or two, a thick semi-liquid called chyme is produced. When the pyloric sphincter, or valve opens, chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes further with digestive enzymes from the pancreas, and then passes through the small intestine, where digestion continues.\nThe parietal cells in the fundus of the stomach, produce a glycoprotein called intrinsic factor which is essential for the absorption of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin), is carried to, and through the stomach, bound to a glycoprotein secreted by the salivary glands - transcobalamin I also called haptocorrin, which protects the acid-sensitive vitamin from the acidic stomach contents. Once in the more neutral duodenum, pancreatic enzymes break down the protective glycoprotein. The freed vitamin B12 then binds to intrinsic factor which is then absorbed by the enterocytes in the ileum.\nThe stomach is a distensible organ and can normally expand to hold about one litre of food. This expansion is enabled by a series of gastric folds in the inner walls of the stomach. The stomach of a newborn baby will only be able to expand to retain about 30 ml.\n### Spleen\nThe spleen is the largest lymphoid organ in the body but has other functions. It breaks down both red and white blood cells that are spent. This is why it is sometimes known as the 'graveyard of red blood cells'. A product of this digestion is the pigment bilirubin, which is sent to the liver and secreted in the bile. Another product is iron, which is used in the formation of new blood cells in the bone marrow. Medicine treats the spleen solely as belonging to the lymphatic system, though it is acknowledged that the full range of its important functions is not yet understood.: 1751 \n### Liver\nThe liver is the second largest organ (after the skin) and is an accessory digestive gland which plays a role in the body's metabolism. The liver has many functions some of which are important to digestion. The liver can detoxify various metabolites; synthesise proteins and produce biochemicals needed for digestion. It regulates the storage of glycogen which it can form from glucose (glycogenesis). The liver can also synthesise glucose from certain amino acids. Its digestive functions are largely involved with the breaking down of carbohydrates. It also maintains protein metabolism in its synthesis and degradation. In lipid metabolism it synthesises cholesterol. Fats are also produced in the process of lipogenesis. The liver synthesises the bulk of lipoproteins. The liver is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen and below the diaphragm to which it is attached at one part, the bare area of the liver. This is to the right of the stomach and it overlies the gall bladder. The liver synthesises bile acids and lecithin to promote the digestion of fat.\n#### Bile\nBile produced by the liver is made up of water (97%), bile salts, mucus and pigments, 1% fats and inorganic salts. Bilirubin is its major pigment. Bile acts partly as a surfactant which lowers the surface tension between either two liquids or a solid and a liquid and helps to emulsify the fats in the chyme. Food fat is dispersed by the action of bile into smaller units called micelles. The breaking down into micelles creates a much larger surface area for the pancreatic enzyme, lipase to work on. Lipase digests the triglycerides which are broken down into two fatty acids and a monoglyceride. These are then absorbed by villi on the intestinal wall. If fats are not absorbed in this way in the small intestine problems can arise later in the large intestine which is not equipped to absorb fats. Bile also helps in the absorption of vitamin K from the diet. Bile is collected and delivered through the common hepatic duct. This duct joins with the cystic duct to connect in a common bile duct with the gallbladder. Bile is stored in the gallbladder for release when food is discharged into the duodenum and also after a few hours.\n#### Gallbladder\nThe gallbladder is a hollow part of the biliary tract that sits just beneath the liver, with the gallbladder body resting in a small depression. It is a small organ where the bile produced by the liver is stored, before being released into the small intestine. Bile flows from the liver through the bile ducts and into the gall bladder for storage. The bile is released in response to cholecystokinin (CCK) a peptide hormone released from the duodenum. The production of CCK (by endocrine cells of the duodenum) is stimulated by the presence of fat in the duodenum.\nIt is divided into three sections, a fundus, body and neck. The neck tapers and connects to the biliary tract via the cystic duct, which then joins the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. At this junction is a mucosal fold called Hartmann's pouch, where gallstones commonly get stuck. The muscular layer of the body is of smooth muscle tissue that helps the gallbladder contract, so that it can discharge its bile into the bile duct. The gallbladder needs to store bile in a natural, semi-liquid form at all times. Hydrogen ions secreted from the inner lining of the gallbladder keep the bile acidic enough to prevent hardening. To dilute the bile, water and electrolytes from the digestion system are added. Also, salts attach themselves to cholesterol molecules in the bile to keep them from crystallising. If there is too much cholesterol or bilirubin in the bile, or if the gallbladder doesn't empty properly the systems can fail. This is how gallstones form when a small piece of calcium gets coated with either cholesterol or bilirubin and the bile crystallises and forms a gallstone. The main purpose of the gallbladder is to store and release bile, or gall. Bile is released into the small intestine in order to help in the digestion of fats by breaking down larger molecules into smaller ones. After the fat is absorbed, the bile is also absorbed and transported back to the liver for reuse.\n### Pancreas\nThe pancreas is a major organ functioning as an accessory digestive gland in the digestive system. It is both an endocrine gland and an exocrine gland. The endocrine part secretes insulin when the blood sugar becomes high; insulin moves glucose from the blood into the muscles and other tissues for use as energy. The endocrine part releases glucagon when the blood sugar is low; glucagon allows stored sugar to be broken down into glucose by the liver in order to re-balance the sugar levels. The pancreas produces and releases important digestive enzymes in the pancreatic juice that it delivers to the duodenum. The pancreas lies below and at the back of the stomach. It connects to the duodenum via the pancreatic duct which it joins near to the bile duct's connection where both the bile and pancreatic juice can act on the chyme that is released from the stomach into the duodenum. Aqueous pancreatic secretions from pancreatic duct cells contain bicarbonate ions which are alkaline and help with the bile to neutralise the acidic chyme that is churned out by the stomach.\nThe pancreas is also the main source of enzymes for the digestion of fats and proteins. Some of these are released in response to the production of CKK in the duodenum. (The enzymes that digest polysaccharides, by contrast, are primarily produced by the walls of the intestines.) The cells are filled with secretory granules containing the precursor digestive enzymes. The major proteases, the pancreatic enzymes which work on proteins, are trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. Elastase is also produced. Smaller amounts of lipase and amylase are secreted. The pancreas also secretes phospholipase A2, lysophospholipase, and cholesterol esterase. The precursor zymogens, are inactive variants of the enzymes; which avoids the onset of pancreatitis caused by autodegradation. Once released in the intestine, the enzyme enteropeptidase present in the intestinal mucosa activates trypsinogen by cleaving it to form trypsin; further cleavage results in chymotripsin.\n### Lower gastrointestinal tract\nThe lower gastrointestinal tract (GI), includes the small intestine and all of the large intestine. The intestine is also called the bowel or the gut. The lower GI starts at the pyloric sphincter of the stomach and finishes at the anus. The small intestine is subdivided into the duodenum, the jejunum and the ileum. The cecum marks the division between the small and large intestine. The large intestine includes the rectum and anal canal.\n#### Small intestine\nPartially digested food starts to arrive in the small intestine as semi-liquid chyme, one hour after it is eaten. The stomach is half empty after an average of 1.2 hours. After four or five hours the stomach has emptied.\nIn the small intestine, the pH becomes crucial; it needs to be finely balanced in order to activate digestive enzymes. The chyme is very acidic, with a low pH, having been released from the stomach and needs to be made much more alkaline. This is achieved in the duodenum by the addition of bile from the gall bladder combined with the bicarbonate secretions from the pancreatic duct and also from secretions of bicarbonate-rich mucus from duodenal glands known as Brunner's glands. The chyme arrives in the intestines having been released from the stomach through the opening of the pyloric sphincter. The resulting alkaline fluid mix neutralises the gastric acid which would damage the lining of the intestine. The mucus component lubricates the walls of the intestine.\nWhen the digested food particles are reduced enough in size and composition, they can be absorbed by the intestinal wall and carried to the bloodstream. The first receptacle for this chyme is the duodenal bulb. From here it passes into the first of the three sections of the small intestine, the duodenum (the next section is the jejunum and the third is the ileum). The duodenum is the first and shortest section of the small intestine. It is a hollow, jointed C-shaped tube connecting the stomach to the jejunum. It starts at the duodenal bulb and ends at the suspensory muscle of duodenum. The attachment of the suspensory muscle to the diaphragm is thought to help the passage of food by making a wider angle at its attachment.\nMost food digestion takes place in the small intestine. Segmentation contractions act to mix and move the chyme more slowly in the small intestine allowing more time for absorption (and these continue in the large intestine). In the duodenum, pancreatic lipase is secreted together with a co-enzyme, colipase to further digest the fat content of the chyme. From this breakdown, smaller particles of emulsified fats called chylomicrons are produced. There are also digestive cells called enterocytes lining the intestines (the majority being in the small intestine). They are unusual cells in that they have villi on their surface which in turn have innumerable microvilli on their surface. All these villi make for a greater surface area, not only for the absorption of chyme but also for its further digestion by large numbers of digestive enzymes present on the microvilli.\nThe chylomicrons are small enough to pass through the enterocyte villi and into their lymph capillaries called lacteals. A milky fluid called chyle, consisting mainly of the emulsified fats of the chylomicrons, results from the absorbed mix with the lymph in the lacteals. Chyle is then transported through the lymphatic system to the rest of the body.\nThe suspensory muscle marks the end of the duodenum and the division between the upper gastrointestinal tract and the lower GI tract. The digestive tract continues as the jejunum which continues as the ileum. The jejunum, the midsection of the small intestine contains circular folds, flaps of doubled mucosal membrane which partially encircle and sometimes completely encircle the lumen of the intestine. These folds together with villi serve to increase the surface area of the jejunum enabling an increased absorption of digested sugars, amino acids and fatty acids into the bloodstream. The circular folds also slow the passage of food giving more time for nutrients to be absorbed.\nThe last part of the small intestine is the ileum. This also contains villi and vitamin B12; bile acids and any residue nutrients are absorbed here. When the chyme is exhausted of its nutrients the remaining waste material changes into the semi-solids called feces, which pass to the large intestine, where bacteria in the gut flora further break down residual proteins and starches.\nTransit time through the small intestine is an average of 4 hours. Half of the food residues of a meal have emptied from the small intestine by an average of 5.4 hours after ingestion. Emptying of the small intestine is complete after an average of 8.6 hours.\n#### Cecum\nThe cecum is a pouch marking the division between the small intestine and the large intestine. It lies below the ileocecal valve in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen. The cecum receives chyme from the last part of the small intestine, the ileum, and connects to the ascending colon of the large intestine. At this junction there is a sphincter or valve, the ileocecal valve which slows the passage of chyme from the ileum, allowing further digestion. It is also the site of the appendix attachment.\n#### Large intestine\nIn the large intestine, the passage of the digesting food in the colon is a lot slower, taking from 30 to 40 hours until it is removed by defecation. The colon mainly serves as a site for the fermentation of digestible matter by the gut flora. The time taken varies considerably between individuals. The remaining semi-solid waste is termed feces and is removed by the coordinated contractions of the intestinal walls, termed peristalsis, which propels the excreta forward to reach the rectum and exit via defecation from the anus. The wall has an outer layer of longitudinal muscles, the taeniae coli, and an inner layer of circular muscles. The circular muscle keeps the material moving forward and also prevents any back flow of waste. Also of help in the action of peristalsis is the basal electrical rhythm that determines the frequency of contractions. The taeniae coli can be seen and are responsible for the bulges (haustra) present in the colon. Most parts of the GI tract are covered with serous membranes and have a mesentery. Other more muscular parts are lined with adventitia.\n## Blood supply\nThe digestive system is supplied by the celiac artery. The celiac artery is the first major branch from the abdominal aorta, and is the only major artery that nourishes the digestive organs.\nThere are three main divisions – the left gastric artery, the common hepatic artery and the splenic artery.\nThe celiac artery supplies the liver, stomach, spleen and the upper 1/3 of the duodenum (to the sphincter of Oddi) and the pancreas with oxygenated blood. Most of the blood is returned to the liver via the portal venous system for further processing and detoxification before returning to the systemic circulation via the hepatic veins.\nThe next branch from the abdominal aorta is the superior mesenteric artery, which supplies the regions of the digestive tract derived from the midgut, which includes the distal 2/3 of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, appendix, ascending colon, and the proximal 2/3 of the transverse colon.\nThe final branch which is important for the digestive system is the inferior mesenteric artery, which supplies the regions of the digestive tract derived from the hindgut, which includes the distal 1/3 of the transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, and the anus above the pectinate line.\nBlood flow to the digestive tract reaches its maximum 20–40 minutes after a meal and lasts for 1.5–2 hours.\n## Nerve supply\nThe enteric nervous system consists of some one hundred million neurons that are embedded in the peritoneum, the lining of the gastrointestinal tract extending from the esophagus to the anus. These neurons are collected into two plexuses - the myenteric (or Auerbach's) plexus that lies between the longitudinal and the smooth muscle layers, and the submucosal (or Meissner's) plexus that lies between the circular smooth muscle layer and the mucosa.\nParasympathetic innervation to the ascending colon is supplied by the vagus nerve. Sympathetic innervation is supplied by the splanchnic nerves that join the celiac ganglia. Most of the digestive tract is innervated by the two large celiac ganglia, with the upper part of each ganglion joined by the greater splanchnic nerve and the lower parts joined by the lesser splanchnic nerve. It is from these ganglia that many of the gastric plexuses arise.\n## Development\nEarly in embryonic development, the embryo has three germ layers and abuts a yolk sac. During the second week of development, the embryo grows and begins to surround and envelop portions of this sac. The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract. Sections of this foregut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the esophagus, stomach, and intestines.\nDuring the fourth week of development, the stomach rotates. The stomach, originally lying in the midline of the embryo, rotates so that its body is on the left. This rotation also affects the part of the gastrointestinal tube immediately below the stomach, which will go on to become the duodenum. By the end of the fourth week, the developing duodenum begins to spout a small outpouching on its right side, the hepatic diverticulum, which will go on to become the biliary tree. Just below this is a second outpouching, known as the cystic diverticulum, that will eventually develop into the gallbladder.\n## Clinical significance\nEach part of the digestive system is subject to a wide range of disorders many of which can be congenital. Mouth diseases can also be caused by pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi and as a side effect of some medications. Mouth diseases include tongue diseases and salivary gland diseases. A common gum disease in the mouth is gingivitis which is caused by bacteria in plaque. The most common viral infection of the mouth is gingivostomatitis caused by herpes simplex. A common fungal infection is candidiasis commonly known as thrush which affects the mucous membranes of the mouth.\nThere are a number of esophageal diseases such as the development of Schatzki rings that can restrict the passageway, causing difficulties in swallowing. They can also completely block the esophagus.\nStomach diseases are often chronic conditions and include gastroparesis, gastritis, and peptic ulcers.\nA number of problems including malnutrition and anemia can arise from malabsorption, the abnormal absorption of nutrients in the GI tract. Malabsorption can have many causes ranging from infection, to enzyme deficiencies such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It can also arise as a result of other gastrointestinal diseases such as coeliac disease. Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine. This can cause vitamin deficiencies due to the improper absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. The small intestine can also be obstructed by a volvulus, a loop of intestine that becomes twisted enclosing its attached mesentery. This can cause mesenteric ischemia if severe enough.\nA common disorder of the bowel is diverticulitis. Diverticula are small pouches that can form inside the bowel wall, which can become inflamed to give diverticulitis. This disease can have complications if an inflamed diverticulum bursts and infection sets in. Any infection can spread further to the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) and cause potentially fatal peritonitis.\nCrohn's disease is a common chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which can affect any part of the GI tract, but it mostly starts in the terminal ileum.\nUlcerative colitis an ulcerative form of colitis, is the other major inflammatory bowel disease which is restricted to the colon and rectum. Both of these IBDs can give an increased risk of the development of colorectal cancer. Ulcerative colitis is the most common of the IBDs\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common of the functional gastrointestinal disorders. These are idiopathic disorders that the Rome process has helped to define.\nGiardiasis is a disease of the small intestine caused by a protist parasite Giardia lamblia. This does not spread but remains confined to the lumen of the small intestine. It can often be asymptomatic, but as often can be indicated by a variety of symptoms. Giardiasis is the most common pathogenic parasitic infection in humans.\nThere are diagnostic tools mostly involving the ingestion of barium sulphate to investigate disorders of the GI tract. These are known as upper gastrointestinal series that enable imaging of the pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, stomach and small intestine and lower gastrointestinal series for imaging of the colon.\n### In pregnancy\nGestation can predispose for certain digestive disorders. Gestational diabetes can develop in the mother as a result of pregnancy and while this often presents with few symptoms it can lead to pre-eclampsia.\n## History\nIn the early 11th century the Islamic medical philosopher Avicenna wrote extensively on many subjects including medicine. Forty of these treatises on medicine survive, and in the most famous one titled the Canon of Medicine he discusses \"rising gas\". Avicenna believed that digestive system dysfunction was responsible for the overproduction of gas in the gastrointestinal tract. He suggested lifestyle changes and a compound of herbal drugs for its treatment.\nIn 1497 Alessandro Benedetti viewed the stomach as an unclean organ separated off by the diaphragm. This view of the stomach and intestines as being base organs was generally held until the mid-17th century.\nIn the Renaissance of the 16th century Leonardo da Vinci produced some early drawings of the stomach and intestines. He thought that the digestive system aided the respiratory system. Andreas Vesalius provided some early anatomical drawings of the abdominal organs in the 16th century.\nIn the middle of the 17th century a Flemish physician Jan Baptist van Helmont offered the first chemical account of digestion which was later described as being very close to the later conceptualised enzyme.\nIn 1653 William Harvey described the intestines in terms of their length, their blood supply, the mesenteries, and fat (adenylyl cyclase).\nIn 1823 William Prout discovered hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice. In 1895 Ivan Pavlov described its secretion as being stimulated by a neurologic reflex with the vagus nerve having a crucial role. Black in the 19th century suggested an association of histamine with this secretion. In 1916 Popielski described histamine as a gastric secretagogue of hydrochloric acid.\nWilliam Beaumont was an army surgeon who in 1825 was able to observe digestion as it took place in the stomach. This was made possible by experiments on a man with a stomach wound that did not fully heal leaving an opening into the stomach. The churning motion of the stomach was described among other findings.\nIn the 19th century it was accepted that chemical processes were involved in the process of digestion. Physiological research into secretion and the gastrointestinal tract was pursued with experiments undertaken by Claude Bernard, Rudolph Heidenhain and Ivan Pavlov.\nThe rest of the 20th century was dominated by research into enzymes. The first to be discovered was secretin by Ernest Starling in 1902, with ensuing results from John Edkins in 1905 who first suggested gastrin with its structure being determined in 1964. Andre Latarjet and Lester Dragstedt found a role for acetylcholine in the digestive system. In 1972 H2 receptor agonists were described by J. Black, that block the action of histamine and decrease the production of hydrochloric acid. In 1980 proton pump inhibitors were described by Sachs. In 1983 the role of Helicobacter pylori in the formation of ulcers was described by Barry Marshall, and Robin Warren.\nArt historians have often noted that banqueters on iconographic records of ancient Mediterranean societies almost always appear to be lying down on their left sides. One possible explanation could lie in the anatomy of the stomach and in the digestive mechanism.

{"name": "Neuraminidase", "documents": ["# Neuraminidase\nExo-α-sialidase (EC 3.2.1.18, sialidase, neuraminidase; systematic name acetylneuraminyl hydrolase) is a glycoside hydrolase that cleaves the glycosidic linkages of neuraminic acids:\nNeuraminidase enzymes are a large family, found in a range of organisms. The best-known neuraminidase is the viral neuraminidase, a drug target for the prevention of the spread of influenza infection. The viral neuraminidases are frequently used as antigenic determinants found on the surface of the influenza virus. Some variants of the influenza neuraminidase confer more virulence to the virus than others. Other homologues are found in mammalian cells, which have a range of functions. At least four mammalian sialidase homologues have been described in the human genome (see NEU1, NEU2, NEU3, NEU4). Sialidases may act as pathogenic factors in microbial infections.\n## Reaction\nThere are two major classes of Neuraminidase that cleave exo or endo poly-sialic acids:\nExo hydrolysis of α-(2→3)-, α-(2→6)-, α-(2→8)-glycosidic linkages of terminal sialic acid residues Endo hydrolysis of (2→8)-α-sialosyl linkages in oligo- or poly(sialic) acids (see EC 3.2.1.129 endo-α-sialidase.)\n## Function\nSialidases, also called neuraminidases, catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acid residues from the newly formed virions and from the host cell receptors. Sialidase activities include assistance in the mobility of virus particles through the respiratory tract mucus and in the elution of virion progeny from the infected cell.\n## Subtypes\nSwiss-Prot lists 137 types of neuraminidase from various species as of October 18, 2006. Nine subtypes of influenza neuraminidase are known; many occur only in various species of duck and chicken. Subtypes N1 and N2 have been positively linked to epidemics in humans, and strains with N3 or N7 subtypes have been identified in a number of isolated deaths.\nCAZy defines a total of 85 glycosyl hydrolase families, of which families GH34 (viral), GH33 (cellular organisms), GH58 (viral and bacterial), GH83 (viral) are major families that contain this enzyme. GH58 is the only endo-acting family.\nThe following is a list of major classes of neuraminidase enzymes:\nViral neuraminidase Bacterial neuraminidase Mammalian neuraminidases:\n## Structure\nInfluenza neuraminidase is a mushroom-shaped projection on the surface of the influenza virus. It has a head consisting of four co-planar and roughly spherical subunits, and a hydrophobic region that is embedded within the interior of the virus' membrane. It comprises a single polypeptide chain that is oriented in the opposite direction to the hemagglutinin antigen. The composition of the polypeptide is a single chain of six conserved polar amino acids, followed by hydrophilic, variable amino acids. β-Sheets predominate as the secondary level of protein conformation.\nThe structure of trans-sialidase includes a catalytic β-propeller domain, a N-terminal lectin-like domain and an irregular beta-stranded domain inserted into the catalytic domain.\nRecent emergence of oseltamivir and zanamivir resistant human influenza A(H1N1) H274Y has emphasized the need for suitable expression systems to obtain large quantities of highly pure and stable, recombinant neuraminidase through two separate artificial tetramerization domains that facilitate the formation of catalytically active neuraminidase homotetramers from yeast and Staphylothermus marinus, which allow for secretion of FLAG-tagged proteins and further purification.\n## Mechanism\nThe enzymatic mechanism of influenza virus sialidase has been studied by Taylor et al., shown in Figure 1. The enzyme catalysis process has four steps. The first step involves the distortion of the α-sialoside from a 2C5 chair conformation (the lowest-energy form in solution) to a pseudoboat conformation when the sialoside binds to the sialidase. The second step leads to an oxocarbocation intermediate, the sialosyl cation. The third step is the formation of Neu5Ac initially as the α-anomer, and then mutarotation and release as the more thermodynamically stable β-Neu5Ac.\n## Inhibitors\nNeuraminidase inhibitors are useful for combating influenza infection: zanamivir, administered by inhalation; oseltamivir, administered orally; peramivir administered parenterally, that is through intravenous or intramuscular injection; and laninamivir which is in phase III clinical trials.\nThere are two major proteins on the surface of influenza virus particles. One is the lectin haemagglutinin protein with three relatively shallow sialic acid-binding sites and the other is enzyme sialidase with the active site in a pocket. Because of the relative deep active site in which low-molecular-weight inhibitors can make multiple favorable interactions and approachable methods of designing transition-state analogues in the hydrolysis of sialosides, the sialidase becomes more attractive anti-influenza drug target than the haemagglutinin. After the X-ray crystal structures of several influenza virus sialidases were available, the structure-based inhibitor design was applied to discover potent inhibitors of this enzyme.\nThe unsaturated sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid ) derivative 2-deoxy-2, 3-didehydro-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac2en), a sialosyl cation transition-state (Figure 2) analogue, is believed the most potent inhibitor core template. Structurally modified Neu5Ac2en derivatives may give more effective inhibitors.\nMany Neu5Ac2en-based compounds have been synthesized and tested for their influenza virus sialidase inhibitory potential. For example: The 4-substituted Neu5Ac2en derivatives (Figure 3), 4-amino-Neu5Ac2en (Compound 1), which showed two orders of magnitude better inhibition of influenza virus sialidase than Neu5Ac2en5 and 4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en (Compound 2), known as Zanamivir, which is now marketed for treatment of influenza virus as a drug, have been designed by von Itzstein and coworkers. A series of amide-linked C9 modified Neu5Ac2en have been reported by Megesh and colleagues as NEU1 inhibitors.", "neuraminidase, also called sialidase, any of a group of enzymes that cleave sialic acid, a carbohydrate occurring on the surfaces of cells in humans and other animals and in plants and microorganisms. In the 1940s American scientist George Hirst identified in samples of influenza virus mixed with red blood cells (erythrocytes) a substance that broke down receptors on the surfaces of red cells. Shortly thereafter, German-born British biochemist Alfred Gottschalk discovered that these receptor-destroying enzymes were neuraminidases. Today, these enzymes are known to occur as antigens (foreign proteins that stimulate the production of antibodies) on the surfaces of certain viruses, namely those of the families Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae, as well as on the surfaces of some infectious bacteria and other microorganisms.\nAntigenic neuraminidases occurring on influenza viruses have been well characterized. Following host-cell infection, these viruses manipulate the cell machinery to replicate themselves. When the replicated viruses bud from the host cells, they remain attached to the host-cell surface by binding between hemagglutinin (another antigenic protein on the surface of the virus) and sialic acid. Neuraminidase cleaves the sialic acid molecule, thereby freeing the virus to infect other cells in the host organism. Antibodies against neuraminidase that are generated by the host’s immune system following infection bind to a portion of the neuraminidase antigen known as an epitope. This binding targets the virus particles for immune destruction. The genes encoding the neuraminidases of influenza viruses are highly susceptible to genetic mutations that modify the epitopes of the antigen. The emergence of a new neuraminidase epitope enables an influenza virus to escape immune recognition, at least until new, matching antibodies have been generated against it. Genetic alterations affecting neuraminidase may arise through antigenic drift or antigenic shift—processes that can give rise to influenza viruses capable of causing epidemics or pandemics. There are 9 different forms of neuraminidase, designated N1 through N9, that are associated with influenza type A viruses. Together with various forms of hemagglutinin, neuraminidase is used to distinguish between subtypes of influenza A viruses (e.g., H1N1, H5N1).\nNeuraminidases occurring on the surfaces of bacteria and other microorganisms are not as well characterized as those found on influenza viruses. However, these enzymes are known to contribute to the virulence of some bacteria. For example, the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces a neuraminidase that appears to facilitate the formation of biofilms in the respiratory tracts of animals. Biofilm production is believed to contribute to the pathogenicity of this organism.\nDrugs called neuraminidase inhibitors, which include oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza), inhibit the release of influenza A and B viruses from host cells.

{"name": "Social science", "documents": ["# Social science\nSocial science is one of the branches of science, devoted to the study of societies and the relationships among individuals within those societies. The term was formerly used to refer to the field of sociology, the original \"science of society\", established in the 19th century. In addition to sociology, it now encompasses a wide array of academic disciplines, including anthropology, archaeology, economics, human geography, linguistics, management science, communication science and political science\nPositivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter modern sense. Interpretivist social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative and qualitative research). The term social research has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share the same goals and methods.\n## History\nThe history of the social sciences begins in the Age of Enlightenment after 1650, which saw a revolution within natural philosophy, changing the basic framework by which individuals understood what was scientific. Social sciences came forth from the moral philosophy of the time and were influenced by the Age of Revolutions, such as the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution. The social sciences developed from the sciences (experimental and applied), or the systematic knowledge-bases or prescriptive practices, relating to the social improvement of a group of interacting entities.\nThe beginnings of the social sciences in the 18th century are reflected in the grand encyclopedia of Diderot, with articles from Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other pioneers. The growth of the social sciences is also reflected in other specialized encyclopedias. The modern period saw \"social science\" first used as a distinct conceptual field. Social science was influenced by positivism, focusing on knowledge based on actual positive sense experience and avoiding the negative; metaphysical speculation was avoided. Auguste Comte used the term science sociale to describe the field, taken from the ideas of Charles Fourier; Comte also referred to the field as social physics.\nFollowing this period, five paths of development sprang forth in the social sciences, influenced by Comte in other fields. One route that was taken was the rise of social research. Large statistical surveys were undertaken in various parts of the United States and Europe. Another route undertaken was initiated by Émile Durkheim, studying \"social facts\", and Vilfredo Pareto, opening metatheoretical ideas and individual theories. A third means developed, arising from the methodological dichotomy present, in which social phenomena were identified with and understood; this was championed by figures such as Max Weber. The fourth route taken, based in economics, was developed and furthered economic knowledge as a hard science. The last path was the correlation of knowledge and social values; the antipositivism and verstehen sociology of Max Weber firmly demanded this distinction. In this route, theory (description) and prescription were non-overlapping formal discussions of a subject.\nThe foundation of social sciences in the West implies conditioned relationships between progressive and traditional spheres of knowledge. In some contexts, such as the Italian one, sociology slowly affirms itself and experiences the difficulty of affirming a strategic knowledge beyond philosophy and theology.\nAround the start of the 20th century, Enlightenment philosophy was challenged in various quarters. After the use of classical theories since the end of the scientific revolution, various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure. The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in methodology. The interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behaviour, social and environmental factors affecting it, made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology. Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social research of medicine, sociobiology, neuropsychology, bioeconomics and the history and sociology of science. Increasingly, quantitative research and qualitative methods are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences. In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics. Statistical methods were used confidently.\nIn the contemporary period, Karl Popper and Talcott Parsons influenced the furtherance of the social sciences. Researchers continue to search for a unified consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed \"grand theory\" with the various midrange theories that, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks; for more, see consilience. The social sciences will for the foreseeable future be composed of different zones in the research of, and sometimes distinct in approach toward, the field.\nThe term \"social science\" may refer either to the specific sciences of society established by thinkers such as Comte, Durkheim, Marx, and Weber, or more generally to all disciplines outside of \"noble science\" and arts. By the late 19th century, the academic social sciences were constituted of five fields: jurisprudence and amendment of the law, education, health, economy and trade, and art.\nAround the start of the 21st century, the expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as economic imperialism.\n## Branches\nThe social science disciplines are branches of knowledge taught and researched at the college or university level. Social science disciplines are defined and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned social science societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong. Social science fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches, and the distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous.\nThe following are problem areas, applied social sciences and discipline branches within the social sciences.\nAnthropology Area studies Business studies Civics Communication studies Criminology Demography Development studies Economics Education Environmental studies Folkloristics Gender studies Geography History Industrial relations Information science International relations Law Library science Linguistics Media studies Political science Psychology Public administration Sociology Social work Sustainable development\n### Anthropology\nAnthropology is the holistic \"science of man\", a science of the totality of human existence. The discipline deals with the integration of different aspects of the social sciences, humanities, and human biology. In the twentieth century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains. Firstly, the natural sciences seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments. Secondly, the humanities generally study local traditions, through their history, literature, music, and arts, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras. Finally, the social sciences have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences.\nThe anthropological social sciences often develop nuanced descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains. Within the United States, anthropology is divided into four sub-fields: archaeology, physical or biological anthropology, anthropological linguistics, and cultural anthropology. It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions. The word anthropos (ἄνθρωπος) in Ancient Greek means \"human being\" or \"person\". Eric Wolf described sociocultural anthropology as \"the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences\".\nThe goal of anthropology is to provide a holistic account of humans and human nature. This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always keep in mind the biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem. Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called \"primitive\" in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of \"inferior\". Today, anthropologists use terms such as \"less complex\" societies or refer to specific modes of subsistence or production, such as \"pastoralist\" or \"forager\" or \"horticulturalist\" to refer to humans living in non-industrial, non-Western cultures, such people or folk (ethnos) remaining of great interest within anthropology.\nThe quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs. In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.\n### Communication studies\nCommunication studies deals with processes of human communication, commonly defined as the sharing of symbols to create meaning. The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation to mass media outlets such as television broadcasting. Communication studies also examine how messages are interpreted through the political, cultural, economic, and social dimensions of their contexts. Communication is institutionalized under many different names at different universities, including communication, communication studies, speech communication, rhetorical studies, communication science, media studies, communication arts, mass communication, media ecology, and communication and media science.\nCommunication studies integrate aspects of both social sciences and the humanities. As a social science, the discipline often overlaps with sociology, psychology, anthropology, biology, political science, economics, and public policy, among others. From a humanities perspective, communication is concerned with rhetoric and persuasion (traditional graduate programs in communication studies trace their history to the rhetoricians of Ancient Greece). The field applies to outside disciplines as well, including engineering, architecture, mathematics, and information science.\n### Economics\nEconomics is a social science that seeks to analyze and describe the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth. The word \"economics\" is from the Ancient Greek οἶκος (oikos, \"family, household, estate\") and νόμος (nomos, \"custom, law\"), and hence means \"household management\" or \"management of the state\". An economist is a person using economic concepts and data in the course of employment, or someone who has earned a degree in the subject. The classic brief definition of economics, set out by Lionel Robbins in 1932, is \"the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses\". Without scarcity and alternative uses, there is no economic problem. Briefer yet is \"the study of how people seek to satisfy needs and wants\" and \"the study of the financial aspects of human behavior\".\nEconomics has two broad branches: microeconomics, where the unit of analysis is the individual agent, such as a household or firm, and macroeconomics, where the unit of analysis is an economy as a whole. Another division of the subject distinguishes positive economics, which seeks to predict and explain economic phenomena, from normative economics, which orders choices and actions by some criterion; such orderings necessarily involve subjective value judgments. Since the early part of the 20th century, economics has focused largely on measurable quantities, employing both theoretical models and empirical analysis. Quantitative models, however, can be traced as far back as the physiocratic school. Economic reasoning has been increasingly applied in recent decades to other social situations such as politics, law, psychology, history, religion, marriage and family life, and other social interactions.\nThis paradigm crucially assumes (1) that resources are scarce because they are not sufficient to satisfy all wants, and (2) that \"economic value\" is willingness to pay as revealed for instance by market (arms' length) transactions. Rival heterodox schools of thought, such as institutional economics, green economics, Marxist economics, and economic sociology, make other grounding assumptions. For example, Marxist economics assumes that economics primarily deals with the investigation of exchange value, of which human labour is the source.\nThe expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as economic imperialism.\n### Education\nEducation encompasses teaching and learning specific skills, and also something less tangible but more profound: the imparting of knowledge, positive judgement and well-developed wisdom. Education has as one of its fundamental aspects the imparting of culture from generation to generation (see socialization). To educate means 'to draw out', from the Latin educare, or to facilitate the realization of an individual's potential and talents. It is an application of pedagogy, a body of theoretical and applied research relating to teaching and learning and draws on many disciplines such as psychology, philosophy, computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, sociology and anthropology.\n### Geography\nGeography as a discipline can be split broadly into two main sub fields: human geography and physical geography. The former focuses largely on the built environment and how space is created, viewed and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy. This may involve cultural geography, transportation, health, military operations, and cities. The latter examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation and life, soil, oceans, water and landforms are produced and interact. Physical geography examines phenomena related to the measurement of earth. As a result of the two subfields using different approaches a third field has emerged, which is environmental geography. Environmental geography combines physical and human geography and looks at the interactions between the environment and humans. Other branches of geography include social geography, regional geography, and geomatics.\nGeographers attempt to understand the Earth in terms of physical and spatial relationships. The first geographers focused on the science of mapmaking and finding ways to precisely project the surface of the earth. In this sense, geography bridges some gaps between the natural sciences and social sciences. Historical geography is often taught in a college in a unified Department of Geography.\nModern geography is an all-encompassing discipline, closely related to Geographic Information Science, that seeks to understand humanity and its natural environment. The fields of urban planning, regional science, and planetology are closely related to geography. Practitioners of geography use many technologies and methods to collect data such as Geographic Information Systems, remote sensing, aerial photography, statistics, and global positioning systems.\n### History\nHistory is the continuous, systematic narrative and research into past human events as interpreted through historiographical paradigms or theories. When used as the name of a field of study, history refers to the study and interpretation of the record of humans, societies, institutions, and any topic that has changed over time.\nTraditionally, the study of history has been considered a part of the humanities. In modern academia, whether or not history remains a humanities-based subject is contested. In the United States the National Endowment for the Humanities includes history in its definition of humanities (as it does for applied linguistics). However, the National Research Council classifies history as a social science. The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history. The Social Science History Association, formed in 1976, brings together scholars from numerous disciplines interested in social history.\n### Law\nThe social science of law, jurisprudence, in common parlance, means a rule that (unlike a rule of ethics) is capable of enforcement through institutions. However, many laws are based on norms accepted by a community and thus have an ethical foundation. The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. It has been defined as a \"system of rules\", as an \"interpretive concept\" to achieve justice, as an \"authority\" to mediate people's interests, and even as \"the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction\". However one likes to think of law, it is a completely central social institution. Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every social science and the humanities. Laws are politics, because politicians create them. Law is philosophy, because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of history's stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. And law is economics, because any rule about contract, tort, property law, labour law, company law and many more can have long-lasting effects on the distribution of wealth. The noun law derives from the Old English lagu, meaning something laid down or fixed and the adjective legal comes from the Latin word lex.\n### Linguistics\nLinguistics investigates the cognitive and social aspects of human language. The field is divided into areas that focus on aspects of the linguistic signal, such as syntax (the study of the rules that govern the structure of sentences), semantics (the study of meaning), morphology (the study of the structure of words), phonetics (the study of speech sounds) and phonology (the study of the abstract sound system of a particular language); however, work in areas like evolutionary linguistics (the study of the origins and evolution of language) and psycholinguistics (the study of psychological factors in human language) cut across these divisions.\nThe overwhelming majority of modern research in linguistics takes a predominantly synchronic perspective (focusing on language at a particular point in time), and a great deal of it—partly owing to the influence of Noam Chomsky—aims at formulating theories of the cognitive processing of language. However, language does not exist in a vacuum, or only in the brain, and approaches like contact linguistics, creole studies, discourse analysis, social interactional linguistics, and sociolinguistics explore language in its social context. Sociolinguistics often makes use of traditional quantitative analysis and statistics in investigating the frequency of features, while some disciplines, like contact linguistics, focus on qualitative analysis. While certain areas of linguistics can thus be understood as clearly falling within the social sciences, other areas, like acoustic phonetics and neurolinguistics, draw on the natural sciences. Linguistics draws only secondarily on the humanities, which played a rather greater role in linguistic inquiry in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Ferdinand Saussure is considered the father of modern linguistics.\n### Political science\nPolitical science is an academic and research discipline that deals with the theory and practice of politics and the description and analysis of political systems and political behaviour. Fields and subfields of political science include political economy, political theory and philosophy, civics and comparative politics, theory of direct democracy, apolitical governance, participatory direct democracy, national systems, cross-national political analysis, political development, international relations, foreign policy, international law, politics, public administration, administrative behaviour, public law, judicial behaviour, and public policy. Political science also studies power in international relations and the theory of great powers and superpowers.\nPolitical science is methodologically diverse, although recent years have witnessed an upsurge in the use of the scientific method, that is, the proliferation of formal-deductive model building and quantitative hypothesis testing. Approaches to the discipline include rational choice, classical political philosophy, interpretivism, structuralism, and behaviouralism, realism, pluralism, and institutionalism. Political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents, interviews, and official records, as well as secondary sources such as scholarly articles, are used in building and testing theories. Empirical methods include survey research, statistical analysis or econometrics, case studies, experiments, and model building.\n### Psychology\nPsychology is an academic and applied field involving the study of behaviour and mental processes. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' daily lives and the treatment of mental illness. The word psychology comes from the Ancient Greek ψυχή (], \"soul\" or \"mind\") and the suffix logy (\"study\").\nPsychology differs from anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology in seeking to capture explanatory generalizations about the mental function and overt behaviour of individuals, while the other disciplines focus on creating descriptive generalizations about the functioning of social groups or situation-specific human behaviour. In practice, however, there is quite a lot of cross-fertilization that takes place among the various fields. Psychology differs from biology and neuroscience in that it is primarily concerned with the interaction of mental processes and behaviour, and of the overall processes of a system, and not simply the biological or neural processes themselves, though the subfield of neuropsychology combines the study of the actual neural processes with the study of the mental effects they have subjectively produced.\nMany people associate psychology with clinical psychology, which focuses on assessment and treatment of problems in living and psychopathology. In reality, psychology has myriad specialties including social psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, educational psychology, industrial-organizational psychology, mathematical psychology, neuropsychology, and quantitative analysis of behaviour.\nPsychology is a very broad science that is rarely tackled as a whole, major block. Although some subfields encompass a natural science base and a social science application, others can be clearly distinguished as having little to do with the social sciences or having a lot to do with the social sciences. For example, biological psychology is considered a natural science with a social scientific application (as is clinical medicine), social and occupational psychology are, generally speaking, purely social sciences, whereas neuropsychology is a natural science that lacks application out of the scientific tradition entirely. In British universities, emphasis on what tenet of psychology a student has studied and/or concentrated is communicated through the degree conferred: BPsy indicates a balance between natural and social sciences, BSc indicates a strong (or entire) scientific concentration, whereas a BA underlines a majority of social science credits. This is not always necessarily the case however, and in many UK institutions students studying the BPsy, BSc, and BA follow the same curriculum as outlined by The British Psychological Society and have the same options of specialism open to them regardless of whether they choose a balance, a heavy science basis, or heavy social science basis to their degree. If they applied to read the BA. for example, but specialized in heavily science-based modules, then they will still generally be awarded the BA.\n### Sociology\nSociology is the systematic study of society, individuals' relationship to their societies, the consequences of difference, and other aspects of human social action. The meaning of the word comes from the suffix -logy, which means \"study of\", derived from Ancient Greek, and the stem soci-, which is from the Latin word socius, meaning \"companion\", or society in general.\nAuguste Comte (1798–1857) coined the term, Sociology, as a way to apply natural science principles and techniques to the social world in 1838. Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology and economics through the descriptive understanding of the social realm. He proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological positivism, an epistemological approach outlined in The Course in Positive Philosophy  and A General View of Positivism (1844). Though Comte is generally regarded as the \"Father of Sociology\", the discipline was formally established by another French thinker, Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), who developed positivism as a foundation to practical social research. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux in 1895, publishing his Rules of the Sociological Method. In 1896, he established the journal L'Année sociologique. Durkheim's seminal monograph, Suicide (1897), a case study of suicide rates among Catholic and Protestant populations, distinguished sociological analysis from psychology or philosophy.\nKarl Marx rejected Comte's positivism but nevertheless aimed to establish a science of society based on historical materialism, becoming recognized as a founding figure of sociology posthumously as the term gained broader meaning. Around the start of the 20th century, the first wave of German sociologists, including Max Weber and Georg Simmel, developed sociological antipositivism. The field may be broadly recognized as an amalgam of three modes of social thought in particular: Durkheimian positivism and structural functionalism; Marxist historical materialism and conflict theory; and Weberian antipositivism and verstehen analysis. American sociology broadly arose on a separate trajectory, with little Marxist influence, an emphasis on rigorous experimental methodology, and a closer association with pragmatism and social psychology. In the 1920s, the Chicago school developed symbolic interactionism. Meanwhile, in the 1930s, the Frankfurt School pioneered the idea of critical theory, an interdisciplinary form of Marxist sociology drawing upon thinkers as diverse as Sigmund Freud and Friedrich Nietzsche. Critical theory would take on something of a life of its own after World War II, influencing literary criticism and the Birmingham School establishment of cultural studies.\nSociology evolved as an academic response to the challenges of modernity, such as industrialization, urbanization, secularization, and a perceived process of enveloping rationalization. The field generally concerns the social rules and processes that bind and separate people not only as individuals, but as members of associations, groups, communities and institutions, and includes the examination of the organization and development of human social life. The sociological field of interest ranges from the analysis of short contacts between anonymous individuals on the street to the study of global social processes. In the terms of sociologists Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann, social scientists seek an understanding of the Social Construction of Reality. Most sociologists work in one or more subfields. One useful way to describe the discipline is as a cluster of sub-fields that examine different dimensions of society. For example, social stratification studies inequality and class structure; demography studies changes in population size or type; criminology examines criminal behaviour and deviance; and political sociology studies the interaction between society and state.\nSince its inception, sociological epistemologies, methods, and frames of enquiry, have significantly expanded and diverged. Sociologists use a diversity of research methods, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data, draw upon empirical techniques, and engage critical theory. Common modern methods include case studies, historical research, interviewing, participant observation, social network analysis, survey research, statistical analysis, and model building, among other approaches. Since the late 1970s, many sociologists have tried to make the discipline useful for purposes beyond the academy. The results of sociological research aid educators, lawmakers, administrators, developers, and others interested in resolving social problems and formulating public policy, through subdisciplinary areas such as evaluation research, methodological assessment, and public sociology.\nIn the early 1970s, women sociologists began to question sociological paradigms and the invisibility of women in sociological studies, analysis, and courses. In 1969, feminist sociologists challenged the discipline's androcentrism at the American Sociological Association's annual conference. This led to the founding of the organization Sociologists for Women in Society, and, eventually, a new sociology journal, Gender & Society. Today, the sociology of gender is considered to be one of the most prominent sub-fields in the discipline.\nNew sociological sub-fields continue to appear — such as community studies, computational sociology, environmental sociology, network analysis, actor-network theory, gender studies, and a growing list, many of which are cross-disciplinary in nature.\n## Additional fields of study\nAdditional applied or interdisciplinary fields related to the social sciences or are applied social sciences include:\nArchaeology is the science that studies human cultures through the recovery, documentation, analysis, and interpretation of material remains and environmental data, including architecture, artifacts, features, biofacts, and landscapes. Area studies are interdisciplinary fields of research and scholarship pertaining to particular geographical, national/federal, or cultural regions. Behavioural science is a term that encompasses all the disciplines that explore the activities of and interactions among organisms in the natural world. Computational social science is an umbrella field encompassing computational approaches within the social sciences. Demography is the statistical study of all human populations. Development studies a multidisciplinary branch of social science that addresses issues of concern to developing countries. Environmental social science is the broad, transdisciplinary study of interrelations between humans and the natural environment. Environmental studies integrate social, humanistic, and natural science perspectives on the relation between humans and the natural environment. Gender studies integrates several social and natural sciences to study gender identity, masculinity, femininity, transgender issues, and sexuality. Information science is an interdisciplinary science primarily concerned with the collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval and dissemination of information. International studies covers both International relations (the study of foreign affairs and global issues among states within the international system) and International education (the comprehensive approach that intentionally prepares people to be active and engaged participants in an interconnected world). Legal management is a social sciences discipline that is designed for students interested in the study of state and legal elements. Library science is an interdisciplinary field that applies the practices, perspectives, and tools of management, information technology, education, and other areas to libraries; the collection, organization, preservation and dissemination of information resources; and the political economy of information. Management consists of various levels of leadership and administration of an organization in all business and human organizations. It is the effective execution of getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives through adequate planning, executing and controlling activities. Marketing the identification of human needs and wants, defines and measures their magnitude for demand and understanding the process of consumer buying behaviour to formulate products and services, pricing, promotion and distribution to satisfy these needs and wants through exchange processes and building long-term relationships. Political economy is the study of production, buying and selling, and their relations with law, custom, and government. Public administration is one of the main branches of political science, and can be broadly described as the development, implementation and study of branches of government policy. The pursuit of the public good by enhancing civil society and social justice is the ultimate goal of the field. Though public administration has been historically referred to as government management, it increasingly encompasses non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that also operate with a similar, primary dedication to the betterment of humanity. Religious studies and Western esoteric studies incorporate and inform social-scientific research on phenomena broadly deemed religious. Religious studies, Western esoteric studies, and the social sciences developed in dialogue with one another.\n## Methodology\n### Social research\nThe origin of the survey can be traced back at least early as the Domesday Book in 1086, while some scholars pinpoint the origin of demography to 1663 with the publication of John Graunt's Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality. Social research began most intentionally, however, with the positivist philosophy of science in the 19th century.\nIn contemporary usage, \"social research\" is a relatively autonomous term, encompassing the work of practitioners from various disciplines that share in its aims and methods. Social scientists employ a range of methods in order to analyse a vast breadth of social phenomena; from census survey data derived from millions of individuals, to the in-depth analysis of a single agent's social experiences; from monitoring what is happening on contemporary streets, to the investigation of ancient historical documents. The methods originally rooted in classical sociology and statistical mathematics have formed the basis for research in other disciplines, such as political science, media studies, and marketing and market research.\nSocial research methods may be divided into two broad schools:\nQuantitative designs approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence, and often rely on statistical analysis of many cases (or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment) to create valid and reliable general claims. Qualitative designs emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation, communication with participants, or analysis of texts, and may stress contextual and subjective accuracy over generality.\nSocial scientists will commonly combine quantitative and qualitative approaches as part of a multi-strategy design. Questionnaires, field-based data collection, archival database information and laboratory-based data collections are some of the measurement techniques used. It is noted the importance of measurement and analysis, focusing on the (difficult to achieve) goal of objective research or statistical hypothesis testing. A mathematical model uses mathematical language to describe a system. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed 'mathematical modelling' (also modeling). A mathematical model is \"a representation of the essential aspects of an existing system (or a system to be constructed) that presents knowledge of that system in usable form\". Mathematical models can take many forms, including but not limited to dynamical systems, statistical models, differential equations, or game theoretic models.\nThese and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures. The system is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole. The concept of an integrated whole can also be stated in terms of a system embodying a set of relationships that are differentiated from relationships of the set to other elements, and from relationships between an element of the set and elements not a part of the relational regime. A dynamical system modeled as a mathematical formalization has a fixed \"rule\" that describes the time dependence of a point's position in its ambient space. Small changes in the state of the system correspond to small changes in the numbers. The evolution rule of the dynamical system is a fixed rule that describes what future states follow from the current state. The rule is deterministic: for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state.\nSocial scientists often conduct program evaluation, which is a systematic method for collecting, analyzing, and using information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs, particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency. In both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effect. While program evaluation first focuses around this definition, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful.\n### Theory\nSome social theorists emphasize the subjective nature of research. These writers espouse social theory perspectives that include various types of the following:\nCritical theory is the examination and critique of society and culture, drawing from knowledge across social sciences and humanities disciplines. Dialectical materialism is the philosophy of Karl Marx, which he formulated by taking the dialectic of Hegel and joining it to the materialism of Feuerbach. Feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical, or philosophical discourse; it aims to understand the nature of gender inequality. Marxist theories, such as revolutionary theory and class theory, cover work in philosophy that is strongly influenced by Karl Marx's materialist approach to theory or is written by Marxists. Phronetic social science is a theory and methodology for doing social science focusing on ethics and political power, based on a contemporary interpretation of Aristotelian phronesis. Post-colonial theory is a reaction to the cultural legacy of colonialism. Postmodernism refers to a point of departure for works of literature, drama, architecture, cinema, and design, as well as in marketing and business and in the interpretation of history, law, culture and religion in the late 20th century. Rational choice theory is a framework for understanding and often formally modeling social and economic behaviour. Social constructionism considers how social phenomena develop in social contexts. Structuralism is an approach to the human sciences that attempts to analyze a specific field (for instance, mythology) as a complex system of interrelated parts. Structural functionalism is a sociological paradigm that addresses what social functions various elements of the social system perform in regard to the entire system.\nOther fringe social theorists delve into the alternative nature of research. These writers share social theory perspectives that include various types of the following:\nAnti-intellectualism describes a sentiment of critique towards, or evaluation of, intellectuals and intellectual pursuits. Antiscience is a position critical of science and the scientific method.\n## Education and degrees\nMost universities offer degrees in social science fields. The Bachelor of Social Science is a degree targeted at the social sciences in particular, it is often more flexible and in-depth than other degrees that include social science subjects.\nIn the United States, a university may offer a student who studies a social sciences field a Bachelor of Arts degree, particularly if the field is within one of the traditional liberal arts such as history, or a BSc: Bachelor of Science degree such as those given by the London School of Economics, as the social sciences constitute one of the two main branches of science (the other being the natural sciences). In addition, some institutions have degrees for a particular social science, such as the Bachelor of Economics degree, though such specialized degrees are relatively rare in the United States.\nGraduate students may get a Master's degree (Master of Arts, Master of Science or a field-specific degree such as Master of Public Administration) or PhD.\n## Low priority of social science\nSocial sciences receive less funding than natural sciences. It has been estimated that only 0.12% of all funding for climate-related research is spent on the social science of climate change mitigation. Vastly more funding is spent on natural science studies of climate change and considerable sums are also spent on studies of the impact of and adaptation to climate change. It has been argued that this is a misallocation of resources, as the most urgent puzzle at the current juncture is to work out how to change human behavior to mitigate climate change, whereas the natural science of climate change is already well established and there will be decades and centuries to handle adaptation.", "social science, any branch of academic study or science that deals with human behaviour in its social and cultural aspects. Usually included within the social sciences are cultural (or social) anthropology, sociology, psychology, political science, and economics. The discipline of historiography is regarded by many as a social science, and certain areas of historical study are almost indistinguishable from work done in the social sciences. Most historians, however, consider history as one of the humanities. In the United States, focused programs, such as African-American Studies, Latinx Studies, Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, are, as a rule, also included among the social sciences, as are often Latin American Studies and Middle Eastern Studies, while, for instance, French, German, or Italian Studies are commonly associated with humanities. In the past, Sovietology was always considered a social science discipline, in contrast to Russian Studies. Beginning in the 1950s, the term behavioral sciences was often applied to the disciplines designated as the social sciences. Those who favoured this term did so in part because these disciplines were thus brought closer to some of the sciences, such as physical anthropology and physiological psychology, which also deal with human behaviour.\nStrictly speaking, the social sciences, as distinct and recognized academic disciplines, emerged only on the cusp of the 20th century. But one must go back farther in time for the origins of some of their fundamental ideas and objectives. In the largest sense, the origins go all the way back to the ancient Greeks and their rationalist inquiries into human nature, the state, and morality. The heritage of both Greece and Rome is a powerful one in the history of social thought, as it is in other areas of Western society. Very probably, apart from the initial Greek determination to study all things in the spirit of dispassionate and rational inquiry, there would be no social sciences today. True, there have been long periods of time, as during the Western Middle Ages, when the Greek rationalist temper was lacking. But the recovery of this temper, through texts of the great classical philosophers, is the very essence of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment in modern European history. With the Enlightenment, in the 17th and 18th centuries, one may begin.\n## Heritage of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance\n## Effects of theology\nThe same impulses that led people in that age to explore Earth, the stellar regions, and the nature of matter led them also to explore the institutions around them: state, economy, religion, morality, and, above all, human nature itself. It was the fragmentation of medieval philosophy and theory, and, with this, the shattering of the medieval worldview that had lain deep in thought until about the 16th century, that was the immediate basis of the rise of the several strands of specialized social thought that were in time to provide the inspiration for the social sciences.\nMedieval theology, especially as it appears in St. Thomas Aquinas’s Summa theologiae (1265/66–1273), contained and fashioned syntheses from ideas about humanity and society—ideas indeed that may be seen to be political, social, economic, anthropological, and geographical in their substance. But it is partly this close relation between medieval theology and ideas of the social sciences that accounts for the different trajectories of the social sciences, on the one hand, and the trajectories of the physical and life sciences, on the other. From the time of the English philosopher Roger Bacon in the 13th century, there were at least some rudiments of physical science that were largely independent of medieval theology and philosophy. Historians of physical science have no difficulty in tracing the continuation of this experimental tradition, primitive and irregular though it was by later standards, throughout the Middle Ages. Side by side with the kinds of experiment made notable by Bacon were impressive changes in technology through the medieval period and then, in striking degree, in the Renaissance. Efforts to improve agricultural productivity; the rising utilization of gunpowder, with consequent development of guns and the problems that they presented in ballistics; growing trade, leading to increased use of ships and improvements in the arts of navigation, including use of telescopes; and the whole range of such mechanical arts in the Middle Ages and Renaissance as architecture, engineering, optics, and the construction of watches and clocks—all of this put a high premium on a pragmatic and operational understanding of at least the simpler principles of mechanics, physics, astronomy, and, in time, chemistry.\nCopernicusGalileoIn short, by the time of Copernicus and Galileo in the 16th century, a fairly broad substratum of physical science existed, largely empirical but not without theoretical implications on which the edifice of modern physical science could be built. It is notable that the empirical foundations of physiology were being established in the studies of the human body being conducted in medieval schools of medicine and, as the career of Leonardo da Vinci so resplendently illustrates, among artists of the Renaissance, whose interest in accuracy and detail of painting and sculpture led to their careful studies of human anatomy.\nVery different was the beginning of the social sciences. In the first place, the Roman Catholic Church, throughout the Middle Ages and even into the Renaissance and Reformation, was much more attentive to what scholars wrote and thought about the human mind and human behaviour in society than it was toward what was being studied and written in the physical sciences. From the church’s point of view, while it might be important to see to it that thought on the physical world corresponded as far as possible to what Scripture said—witnessed, for example, in the famous questioning of Galileo—it was far more important that such correspondence exist in matters affecting the human mind, spirit, and soul. Nearly all the subjects and questions that would form the bases of the social sciences in later centuries were tightly woven into the fabric of medieval Scholasticism, and it was not easy for even the boldest minds to break this fabric.\n## Effects of the classics and of Cartesianism\nThen, when the hold of Scholasticism did begin to wane, two fresh influences, equally powerful, came on the scene to prevent anything comparable to the pragmatic and empirical foundations of the physical sciences from forming in the study of humanity and society. The first was the immense appeal of the Greek classics during the Renaissance, especially those of the philosophers Plato and Aristotle. A great deal of social thought during the Renaissance was little more than gloss or commentary on the Greek classics. One sees this throughout the 15th and 16th centuries.\nRené DescartesSecond, in the 17th century there appeared the powerful influence of the philosopher René Descartes. Cartesianism, as his philosophy was called, declared that the proper approach to understanding of the world, including humanity and society, was through a few simple, fundamental ideas of reality and, then, rigorous, almost geometrical deduction of more complex ideas and eventually of large, encompassing theories, from these simple ideas, all of which, Descartes insisted, were the stock of common sense—the mind that is common to all human beings at birth. It would be hard to exaggerate the impact of Cartesianism on social and political and moral thought during the century and a half following publication of his Discourse on Method (1637) and his Meditations on First Philosophy (1641). Through the Enlightenment into the later 18th century, the spell of Cartesianism was cast on nearly all those who were concerned with the problems of human nature and human society.\nGreat amounts of data pertinent to the study of human behaviour were becoming available in the 17th and 18th centuries. The emergence of nationalism and the associated impersonal state carried with it ever growing bureaucracies concerned with gathering information, chiefly for taxation, census, and trade purposes. The voluminous and widely published accounts of the great voyages that had begun in the 15th century, the records of soldiers, explorers, and missionaries who perforce had been brought into often long and close contact with indigenous and other non-Western peoples, provided still another great reservoir of data. Until the beginning of the 19th century, these and other empirical materials were used, if at all, solely for illustrative purposes in the writings of the social philosophers. Just as in the equally important area of the study of life, no philosophical framework as yet existed to allow for an objective and comprehensive interpretation of these empirical materials. Only in physics could this be done at the time.\n## Effects of theology\nThe same impulses that led people in that age to explore Earth, the stellar regions, and the nature of matter led them also to explore the institutions around them: state, economy, religion, morality, and, above all, human nature itself.

{"name": "I, Robot", "documents": ["# I, Robot\nI, Robot is a fixup (compilation) novel of science fiction short stories or essays by American writer Isaac Asimov. The stories originally appeared in the American magazines Super Science Stories and Astounding Science Fiction between 1940 and 1950 and were then compiled into a book for stand-alone (single issue / special edition) publication by Gnome Press in 1950, in an initial edition of 5,000 copies. The stories are woven together by a framing narrative in which the fictional Dr. Susan Calvin tells each story to a reporter (who serves as the narrator) in the 21st century. Although the stories can be read separately, they share a theme of the interaction of humans, robots, and morality, and when combined they tell a larger story of Asimov's fictional history of robotics.\nSeveral of the stories feature the character of Dr. Calvin, chief robopsychologist at U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men, Inc., the major manufacturer of robots. Upon their publication in this collection, Asimov wrote a framing sequence presenting the stories as Calvin's reminiscences during an interview with her about her life's work, chiefly concerned with aberrant behaviour of robots and the use of \"robopsychology\" to sort out what is happening in their positronic brain. The book also contains the short story in which Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics first appear, which had large influence on later science fiction and had impact on thought on ethics of artificial intelligence as well. Other characters that appear in these short stories are Powell and Donovan, a field-testing team which locates flaws in USRMM's prototype models.\nThe collection shares a title with the then recent short story \"I, Robot\" (1939) by Eando Binder (pseudonym of Earl and Otto Binder), which greatly influenced Asimov. Asimov had wanted to call his collection Mind and Iron and objected when the publisher made the title the same as Binder's. In his introduction to the story in Isaac Asimov Presents the Great SF Stories (1979), Asimov wrote:\nIt certainly caught my attention. Two months after I read it, I began \"Robbie\", about a sympathetic robot, and that was the start of my positronic robot series. Eleven years later, when nine of my robot stories were collected into a book, the publisher named the collection I, Robot over my objections. My book is now the more famous, but Otto's story was there first.— Isaac Asimov (1979)\n## Contents\n\"Introduction\" (the initial portion of the framing story or linking text) \"Robbie\" (1940, 1950) \"Runaround\" (1942), novelette \"Reason\" (1941) \"Catch That Rabbit\" (1944) \"Liar!\" (1941) \"Little Lost Robot\" (1947), novelette \"Escape!\" (1945) \"Evidence\" (1946), novelette \"The Evitable Conflict\" (1950), novelette\n## Reception\nThe New York Times described I, Robot as \"an exciting science thriller  could be fun for those whose nerves are not already made raw by the potentialities of the atomic age\".\nDescribing it as \"continuously fascinating\", Groff Conklin \"unreservedly recommended\" the book.\nP. Schuyler Miller recommended the collection: \"For puzzle situations, for humor, for warm character,  for most of the values of plain good writing.\"\n## Dramatic adaptations\n### Television\nAt least three of the short stories from I, Robot have been adapted for television. The first was a 1962 episode of Out of this World hosted by Boris Karloff called \"Little Lost Robot\" with Maxine Audley as Susan Calvin. Two short stories from the collection were made into episodes of Out of the Unknown: \"The Prophet\" (1967), based on \"Reason\"; and \"Liar!\" (1969). Both episodes were wiped by the BBC and are no longer thought to exist, although video clips, audio extracts and still photographs have survived. The 12th episode of the USSR science fiction TV series This Fantastic World, filmed in 1987 and entitled Don't Joke with Robots, was based on works by Aleksandr Belyaev and Fredrik Kilander as well as Asimov's \"Liar!\" story.\nBoth the original and revival series of The Outer Limits include episodes named \"I, Robot\"; however, both are adaptations of the Earl and Otto Binder story of that name and are unconnected with Asimov's work.\n### Films\n#### Harlan Ellison's screenplay (1978)\nIn the late 1970s, Warner Bros. acquired the option to make a film based on the book, but no screenplay was ever accepted. The most notable attempt was one by Harlan Ellison, who collaborated with Asimov himself to create a version which captured the spirit of the original. Asimov is quoted as saying that this screenplay would lead to \"the first really adult, complex, worthwhile science fiction movie ever made.\"\nEllison's script builds a framework around Asimov's short stories that involves a reporter named Robert Bratenahl tracking down information about Susan Calvin's alleged former lover Stephen Byerly. Asimov's stories are presented as flashbacks that differ from the originals in their stronger emphasis on Calvin's character. Ellison placed Calvin into stories in which she did not originally appear and fleshed out her character's role in ones where she did. In constructing the script as a series of flashbacks that focused on character development rather than action, Ellison used the film Citizen Kane as a model.\nAlthough acclaimed by critics, the screenplay is generally considered to have been unfilmable based upon the technology and average film budgets of the time. Asimov also believed that the film may have been scrapped because of a conflict between Ellison and the producers: when the producers suggested changes in the script, instead of being diplomatic as advised by Asimov, Ellison \"reacted violently\" and offended the producers. The script was serialized in Asimov's Science Fiction magazine in late 1987, and eventually appeared in book form under the title I, Robot: The Illustrated Screenplay, in 1994 (reprinted 2004, ISBN 1-4165-0600-4).\n#### 2004 film\nThe film I, Robot, starring Will Smith, was released by Twentieth Century Fox on July 16, 2004 in the United States. Its plot incorporates elements of \"Little Lost Robot\", some of Asimov's character names and the Three Laws. However, the plot of the movie is mostly original work adapted from the screenplay Hardwired by Jeff Vintar, completely unlinked to Asimov's stories and has been compared to Asimov's The Caves of Steel, which revolves around the murder of a roboticist (although the rest of the film's plot is not based on that novel or other works by Asimov). Unlike the books by Asimov, the movie featured hordes of killer robots.\n### Radio\nBBC Radio 4 aired an audio drama adaptation of five of the I, Robot stories on their 15 Minute Drama in 2017, dramatized by Richard Kurti and starring Hermione Norris.\nRobbie Reason Little Lost Robot Liar The Evitable Conflict\nThese also aired in a single program on BBC Radio 4 Extra as Isaac Asimov's 'I, Robot': Omnibus.\n## Prequels\nThe Asimov estate asked Mickey Zucker Reichert (best known for the Norse fantasy Renshai series) to write three prequels for I, Robot, since she was a science fiction writer with a medical degree who had first met Asimov when she was 23, although she did not know him well. She was the first female writer to be authorized to write stories based on Asimov's novels.\nThe follow-ups to Asimov's Foundation series had been written by Gregory Benford, Greg Bear, and David Brin.\nBerkley Books ordered the I, Robot prequels, which included:\nI, Robot: To Protect (2011) I, Robot: To Obey (2013) I, Robot: To Preserve (2016)\n## Popular culture references\nIn 2004, The Saturday Evening Post said that I, Robot's Three Laws \"revolutionized the science fiction genre and made robots far more interesting than they ever had been before.\" I, Robot has influenced many aspects of modern popular culture, particularly with respect to science fiction and technology. One example of this is in the technology industry. The name of the real-life modem manufacturer named U.S. Robotics was directly inspired by I, Robot. The name is taken from the name of a robot manufacturer (\"United States Robots and Mechanical Men\") that appears throughout Asimov's robot short stories.\nMany works in the field of science fiction have also paid homage to Asimov's collection.\nAn episode of the original Star Trek series, \"I, Mudd\" (1967), which depicts a planet of androids in need of humans, references I, Robot. Another reference appears in the title of a Star Trek: The Next Generation episode, \"I, Borg\" (1992), in which Geordi La Forge befriends a lost member of the Borg collective and teaches it a sense of individuality and free will.\nA Doctor Who story, The Robots of Death (1977), references I, Robot with the \"First Principle\", stating: \"It is forbidden for robots to harm humans.\"\nIn the film Aliens (1986), the synthetic person Bishop paraphrases Asimov's First Law in the line: \"It is impossible for me to harm, or by omission of action allow to be harmed, a human being.\"\nAn episode of The Simpsons entitled \"I D'oh Bot\" (2004) has Professor Frink build a robot named \"Smashius Clay\" (also named \"Killhammad Aieee\") that follows all three of Asimov's laws of robotics.\nThe animated science fiction/comedy Futurama makes several references to I, Robot. The title of the episode \"I, Roommate\" (1999) is a spoof on I, Robot although the plot of the episode has little to do with the original stories. Additionally, the episode \"The Cyber House Rules\" included an optician named \"Eye Robot\" and the episode \"Anthology of Interest II\" included a segment called \"I, Meatbag.\" Also in \"Bender's Game\" (2008) the psychiatrist is shown a logical fallacy and explodes when the assistant shouts \"Liar!\" a la \"Liar!\". Leela once told Bender to \"cover his ears\" so that he would not hear the robot-destroying paradox which she used to destroy Robot Santa (he punishes the bad, he kills people, killing is bad, therefore he must punish himself), causing a total breakdown; additionally, Bender has stated that he is Three Laws Safe.\nThe positronic brain, which Asimov named his robots' central processors, is what powers Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation, as well as other Soong type androids. Positronic brains have been referenced in a number of other television shows including Doctor Who, Once Upon a Time... Space, Perry Rhodan, The Number of the Beast, and others.\nAuthor Cory Doctorow has written a story called \"I, Robot\" as homage to and critique of Asimov, as well as \"I, Row-Boat\", both released in the 2007 short story collection Overclocked: Stories of the Future Present. He has also said, \"If I return to this theme, it will be with a story about uplifted cheese sandwiches, called 'I, Rarebit.'\"\nOther cultural references to the book are less directly related to science fiction and technology. The album I Robot (1977), by The Alan Parsons Project, was inspired by Asimov's I, Robot. In its original conception, the album was to follow the themes and concepts presented in the short story collection. The Alan Parsons Project were not able to obtain the rights in spite of Asimov's enthusiasm; he had already assigned the rights elsewhere. Thus, the album's concept was altered slightly although the name was kept (minus comma to avoid copyright infringement). An album, I, Human (2009), by Singaporean band Deus Ex Machina, draws heavily upon Asimov's principles on robotics and applies it to the concept of cloning.\nThe Indian science fiction film Endhiran (2010) refers to Asimov's three laws for artificial intelligence for the fictional character \"Chitti: The Robot\". When a scientist takes in the robot for evaluation, the panel inquires whether the robot was built using the Three Laws of Robotics.\nThe theme for Burning Man 2018 was \"I, Robot\".", "Isaac Asimov\nI, Robot, a collection of nine short stories by science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov that imagines the development of “positronic” (humanlike, with a form of artificial intelligence) robots and wrestles with the moral implications of the technology. The stories originally appeared in science-fiction magazines between 1940 and 1950, the year that they were first published together in book form. Asimov’s treatment of robots as being programmed with ethics rather than as marauding metal monsters was greatly influential in the development of science fiction.\n## Summary\nThe nine stories are linked by a framing narrative involving a reporter’s interview with Susan Calvin, a former robopsychologist at U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men, Inc., whose work involved dysfunctional robots and the problems inherent in human-robot interactions. The stories centre on problems that arise from the ethical programming, summed up in Asimov’s famed Three Laws of Robotics:\n1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First and Second Laws.\nThe first story, “ Robbie,” is set in 1998 and centres on a little girl, Gloria, who loves her nursemaid robot, Robbie. Her mother comes to believe that robots are unsafe, however, and Robbie is returned to the factory. Gloria is heartbroken. In an effort to show her that robots are machines, not people, her parents take her to see robots being assembled at a factory. One of the assembling robots is Robbie. Gloria endangers her life running to Robbie, and Robbie rescues Gloria, persuading Gloria’s mother that robots can be trusted.\nThe next three stories take place over 18 months, beginning in 2015, and feature Calvin’s colleagues Gregory Powell and Mike Donovan as they attempt to figure out why robots are malfunctioning. In one case, it is a conflict between two of the Laws of Robotics; in another, a robot refuses to accept human orders but nonetheless does the right thing; and in the third, a robot is unable to operate a large number of subordinate robots.\nThe next story, “Liar!,” takes place in 2021. A robot named Herbie has been erroneously programmed to have telepathic abilities. In order to avoid hurting the feelings of the people with whom it interacts, Herbie tells flattering lies. In addition, though Herbie is aware of the programming error, it knows that the researchers want to solve the problem themselves and so will not help them. Calvin tells Herbie that withholding the information and yielding the information will both be hurtful to humans, and the conflict causes Herbie to shut down.\nIn “Little Lost Robot,” set in 2029, scientists working in a dangerous environment modify the First Law’s programming in some robots to keep them from interfering with humans. After an exasperated researcher tells one such robot to lose itself, the robot hides in a group of identical but unmodified robots. Calvin devises several tests to trick the robot into identifying itself, but the robot outsmarts her until she bases one test on its superior physics programming. The modified robots are then destroyed.\nDonovan and Powell return for “Escape!,” about a positronic supercomputer attempting to figure out how to create a spaceship that will allow the crew to survive a hyperspace jump. The hyperspace jump causes humans to briefly cease to exist, and the supercomputer copes with having to violate the First Law by creating a spaceship filled with practical jokes.\nThe final two stories are set in 2032 and 2052, respectively, and concern a politician who may or may not be a robot and whether the Machines that order the economic systems are planning a war against humanity.\n## Influence\nAsimov’s Three Laws spread throughout science fiction, and almost every robot in books or film was subsequently created with them in mind. In the late 1970s American author Harlan Ellison collaborated with Asimov on a screenplay for I, Robot that was never filmed but was published in 1994 as I, Robot: The Illustrated Screenplay. The 2004 film I, Robot was inspired by but not adapted from Asimov’s work.\n[Cathy Lowne](/contributor/Cathy-Lowne/9821964) [Pat Bauer](/editor/pat-bauer/3520770)"], "selected_questions": ["What are the Three Laws of Robotics first mentioned in \"I, Robot\"?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The Three Laws of Robotics are first mentioned in \"I, Robot\" and were created by Isaac Asimov.

{"name": "Opus Dei", "documents": ["# Opus Dei\nOpus Dei, formally known as the Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei (Latin: Praelatura Sanctae Crucis et Operis Dei), is an institution of the Catholic Church whose members seek personal Christian holiness and strive to imbue their work and society with Christian principles.\nThe majority of its membership are lay people; the remainder are secular priests under the governance of a prelate elected by specific members and appointed by the Pope. Opus Dei is Latin for \"Work of God\"; hence the organization is often referred to by members and supporters as the Work.\nOpus Dei was founded in Spain in 1928 by Catholic priest Josemaría Escrivá and was given final Catholic Church approval in 1950 by Pope Pius XII. John Paul II made it a personal prelature in 1982 by the apostolic constitution Ut sit; that is, the jurisdiction of the Opus Dei's head covers members wherever they are, rather than geographical dioceses. On 14 July 2022, Pope Francis issued the apostolic letter Ad charisma tuendum, which transferred responsibility for the Opus Dei from the Dicastery for Bishops to the Dicastery for the Clergy and decreed that the head of the Opus Dei cannot become a bishop. While Opus Dei has met controversies, it remains influential within the Roman Church.\nAs of 2018, there were 95,318 members of the Prelature: 93,203 lay persons and 2,115 priests. These figures do not include the diocesan priest members of Opus Dei's Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, estimated to number 2,000 in the year 2005. Members are located in more than 90 countries. About 70% of Opus Dei members live in their own homes, leading family lives with secular careers, while the other 30% are celibate, of whom the majority live in Opus Dei centers. Aside from their personal charity and social work, Opus Dei members organize training in Catholic spirituality applied to daily life; members are involved in running universities, university residences, schools, publishing houses, hospitals, and technical and agricultural training centers.\n## History\n### Foundational period\nOpus Dei was founded by a Catholic priest, Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer, on 2 October 1928 in Madrid, Spain. According to Escrivá, on that day he experienced a vision in which he \"saw Opus Dei\". He gave the organization the name \"Opus Dei\", which in Latin means \"Work of God\", in order to underscore the belief that the organization was not his (Escrivá's) work, but was rather God's work. Throughout his life, Escrivá held that the founding of Opus Dei had a supernatural character. Escrivá summarized Opus Dei's mission as a way of helping ordinary Christians \"to understand that their life... is a way of holiness and evangelization... And to those who grasp this ideal of holiness, the Work offers the spiritual assistance and training they need to put it into practice.\"\nInitially, Opus Dei was open only to men, but in 1930, Escrivá started to admit women, based on what he believed to be a communication from God. In 1936, the organization suffered a temporary setback with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, as many Catholic priests and religious figures, including Escrivá, were forced into hiding. After the civil war was won by General Francisco Franco, Escrivá was able to return to Madrid. Escrivá himself recounted that it was in Spain where Opus Dei found \"the greatest difficulties\" because of \"enemies of personal freedom,\" and traditionalists who he felt misunderstood Opus Dei's ideas. Despite this, Opus Dei flourished during the years of the Franquismo, spreading first throughout Spain, and after 1945, expanding internationally.\nIn 1939, Escrivá published The Way, a collection of 999 maxims concerning spirituality for people involved in secular affairs. In the 1940s, Opus Dei found an early critic in the Jesuit Superior General Wlodimir Ledóchowski, who told the Vatican that he considered Opus Dei \"very dangerous for the Church in Spain,\" citing its \"secretive character\" and calling it \"a form of Christian Masonry.\"\nIn 1947, a year after Escrivá moved the organization's headquarters to Rome, Opus Dei received a decree of praise and approval from Pope Pius XII, making it an institute of \"pontifical right\", i.e. under the direct governance of the Pope. In 1950, Pius XII granted definitive approval to Opus Dei, thereby allowing married people to join the organization, and secular clergy to be admitted to the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross.\nSeveral Opus Dei members such as Alberto Ullastres were ministers (\"Opusdeistas\") under the dictator Franco in Spain (see Opus Dei and politics).\n### Post-foundational years\nIn 1975, Escrivá died and was succeeded by Álvaro del Portillo. In 1982, Opus Dei was made into a personal prelature. This means that Opus Dei is part of the Catholic Church, and the apostolate of the members falls under the direct jurisdiction of the prelate of Opus Dei wherever they are. As to \"what the law lays down for all the ordinary faithful\", the lay members of Opus Dei, being no different from other Catholics, \"continue to be  under the jurisdiction of the diocesan bishop\", in the words of John Paul II's Ut Sit.\nOne-third of the world's bishops sent letters petitioning for the canonization of Escrivá. Escrivá was beatified in 1992 in the midst of controversy prompted by questions about his suitability for sainthood. In 2002, approximately 300,000 people gathered in St. Peter's Square on the day Pope John Paul II canonized him. According to John L. Allen Jr., \"Escrivá is... venerated by millions\".\nThere are other members whose process of beatification has been opened: Ernesto Cofiño, a father of five children and a pioneer in pediatric research in Guatemala; Montserrat Grases, a teenage Catalan student who died of cancer; Toni Zweifel, a Swiss engineer; Tomás Alvira and wife, Paquita Domínguez, a Spanish married couple; Isidoro Zorzano Ledesma, an Argentinian engineer; Dora del Hoyo, a domestic worker; Fr. Josemaria Hernandez Garnica; and Father José Luis Múzquiz de Miguel, a Spanish priest who began Opus Dei in the United States.\nDuring the pontificate of John Paul II, two members of Opus Dei, Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne and Julián Herranz Casado, were made cardinals.\nIn September 2005, Pope Benedict XVI blessed a newly installed statue of Josemaría Escrivá placed in an outside wall niche of St Peter's Basilica, a place for founders of Catholic organizations.\nDuring that same year, Opus Dei received some unwanted attention due to the extraordinary success of the novel The Da Vinci Code, in which both Opus Dei and the Catholic Church itself are depicted negatively. The film version was released globally in May 2006, further polarizing views on the organization.\nIn 2014, Pope Francis through a delegate beatified Alvaro del Portillo and said that \"he teaches us that in the simplicity and ordinariness of our life we can find a sure path to holiness.\nAt the end of 2014, the prelature has been established in 69 countries, while its members are present in 90 countries.\nJavier Echevarría Rodríguez, the second prelate of Opus Dei, died on 12 December 2016, and was succeeded by Fernando Ocáriz. He was elected the new prelate of Opus Dei on 23 January 2017, and on the same day was appointed by Pope Francis as such.\nIn 2019, Guadalupe Ortiz de Landázuri, one of the first women who joined Opus Dei, was beatified in Madrid, Spain. She is the first lay faithful, as well as the first woman, in Opus Dei to be beatified.\n#### Sexual abuse cases\nIn 2005, the first publicly-known sexual abuse case of Opus Dei in the US, against C. John McCloskey, was settled for $977,000. In July 2020, Opus Dei publicly acknowledged for the first time ever that they had a sexual abuse case, this one involving the priest Manuel Cociña in Spain.\n### Reform decreed by Pope Francis\nOn 22 July 2022, Pope Francis issued the apostolic letter in the form of a motu proprio Ad charisma tuendum. Among other things, the new disposition decrees that the head of the Opus Dei \"shall not be honoured with the episcopal order\", but \"is granted, by reason of his office, the use of the title of Supernumerary Apostolic Protonotary with the title of Reverend Monsignor and therefore may use the insignia  corresponding to this title\". It also transfers responsibility for the personal prelature Opus Dei from the Dicastery for Bishops to the Dicastery for the Clergy, conforming to the apostolic constitution Praedicate evangelium, and mandates revision of the statutes of the personal prelature to bring them into conformity with these reforms. This reform became effective on 4 August 2022, and is viewed as reducing the power and influence of the prelature within the Catholic church.\n## Spirituality\n### Doctrine\nOpus Dei is an organization of the Catholic Church. As such, it shares the doctrines of the Catholic Church and has \"no other teaching than the teaching of the Magisterium of the Holy See\", as per the founder.\nOpus Dei places special emphasis on certain aspects of Catholic doctrine. A central feature of Opus Dei's theology is its focus on the lives of the ordinary Catholics who are neither priests nor monks. Opus Dei emphasizes the \"universal call to holiness\": the belief that everyone should aspire to be a saint, as per Jesus' commandment to \"Love God with all your heart\" (Matthew 22:37) and \"Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.\" (Matthew 5:48) Opus Dei also teaches that sanctity is within the reach of everyone, not just a few special individuals, given Jesus' teaching that his demands are \"easy\" and \"light,\" as his divine assistance is assured.\nOpus Dei does not have monks or nuns, and only a minority of its members are priests. Opus Dei emphasizes uniting spiritual life with professional, social, and family life. Members of Opus Dei lead ordinary lives, with traditional families and secular careers, and strive to \"sanctify ordinary life\". Indeed, Pope John Paul II called Escrivá \"the saint of ordinary life\".\nSimilarly, Opus Dei stresses the importance of work and professional competence. While some religious institutes encourage their members to withdraw from the material world, Opus Dei exhorts its members and all lay Catholics to \"find God in daily life\" and to perform their work excellently as a service to society and as a fitting offering to God. Opus Dei teaches that work not only contributes to social progress but is \"a path to holiness\".\nThe biblical roots of this Catholic doctrine, according to the founder, are in the phrase \"God created man to work\" (Genesis 2:15) and Jesus's long life as an ordinary carpenter in a small town. Escrivá, who stressed the Christian's duty to follow Christ's example, also points to the gospel account that Jesus \"has done everything well\" (Mark 7:37).\nThe foundation of the Christian life, stressed Escrivá, is divine filiation: Christians are children of God, identified with Christ's life and mission. Other main features of Opus Dei, according to its official literature, are freedom, respecting choice and taking personal responsibility, and charity, love of God above all and love of others.\nAt the bottom of Escrivá's understanding of the \"universal call to holiness\" are two dimensions, subjective and objective, according to Fernando Ocariz, a Catholic theologian and prelate of Opus Dei since 2017. The subjective is the call given to each person to become a saint, regardless of their place in society. The objective refers to what Escrivá calls Christian materialism: all of creation, even the most material situation, is a meeting place with God, and leads to union with him.\n### Prayers\nAll members – whether married or unmarried, priests or laypeople – are trained to follow a 'plan of life', or 'the norms of piety', which are some traditional Catholic devotions. This is meant to follow the teaching of the Catholic Catechism: \"pray at specific times...to nourish continual prayer\".\n### Mortification\nAs a spirituality for ordinary people, Opus Dei focuses on performing sacrifices pertaining to normal duties and to its emphasis on charity and cheerfulness. However, much public attention has focused on Opus Dei's practice of mortification—the voluntary offering up of discomfort or pain to God; this includes fasting, or for its celibate members, \"corporal mortifications\" such as self-inflicted pain (self-flagellation), sleeping without a pillow or sleeping on the floor, fasting, and if compatible with their family or professional duties, remaining silent for certain hours during the day. Mortification has a long history in many world religions, including the Catholic Church. It has been endorsed by popes as a way of following Christ, who died in a bloody crucifixion and who, speaking of anybody that sought to be his disciple, said: \"let him deny himself, take up his cross daily and follow me\" (Luke 9:23). Supporters say that opposition to mortification is rooted in having lost (1) the \"sense of the enormity of sin\" or offense against God, and the consequent penance, both interior and exterior, (2) the notions of \"wounded human nature\" and of concupiscence or inclination to sin, and thus the need for \"spiritual battle\", and (3) a spirit of sacrifice for love and \"supernatural ends\", and not only for physical enhancement.\n## Organization and activities\n### Governance\nIn Pope John Paul II's 1982 decree known as the Apostolic constitution Ut Sit, Opus Dei was established as a personal prelature, a new official structure of the Catholic Church, similar to a diocese in that it contains lay people and secular priests who are led by a bishop. However, whereas a bishop normally has a territory or diocese, the prelate of Opus Dei is pastor to the members and priests of Opus Dei worldwide, no matter what diocese they are in. To date, Opus Dei is the only personal prelature in existence. In addition to being governed by Ut Sit and by the Catholic Church's general law, Opus Dei is governed by the church's Particular Law concerning Opus Dei, otherwise known as Opus Dei's statutes. This specifies the objectives and workings of the prelature. The prelature is under the Congregation for Bishops.\nThe head of the Opus Dei prelature is known as the prelate. The prelate is the primary governing authority and is assisted by two councils—the General Council (made up of men) and the Central Advisory (made up of women). The prelate holds his position for life. The current prelate of Opus Dei is Fernando Ocáriz Braña, who became the third prelate of Opus Dei on 23 January 2017. The first prelate of Opus Dei was Álvaro del Portillo, who held the position from 1982 until his death in 1994.\nOpus Dei's highest assembled bodies are the General Congresses, which are usually convened once every eight years. There are separate congresses for the men's and women's branches of Opus Dei. The General Congresses are made up of members appointed by the prelate and are responsible for advising him about the prelature's future. The men's General Congress also elects the prelate from a list of candidates chosen by their female counterparts. After the death of a prelate, a special elective General Congress is convened. The women nominate their preferred candidates for the prelate and is voted upon by the men to become the next prelate—an appointment that must be confirmed by the Pope.\n### Membership\nBased on the language of Catholic Church law and theology, the prelature calls the people under the pastoral care of the prelate as \"faithful of the prelature\", since the term member connotes an association rather than a hierarchical structure such as a prelature or a diocese.\nAs of 2018, the faithful of the Opus Dei Prelature numbered 95,318 members, of which 93,203 are lay persons, men and women, and 2,115 priests. These figures do not include the priest members of Opus Dei's Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, estimated to number 2,000 in the year 2005.\nAbout 60 percent of Opus Dei faithful reside in Europe, and 35 percent reside in the Americas. Women comprise 57% of the total membership. According to the study of John Allen, for the most part, Opus Dei faithful belong to the middle to low levels in society in terms of education, income, and social status.\nOpus Dei is made up of several different types of faithful. According to the Statutes of Opus Dei, the distinction derives from the degree to which they make themselves available for the official activities of the Prelature and for giving formation according to the spirit of Opus Dei.\nSupernumeraries, the largest type, currently account for about 70% of the total membership. Typically, supernumeraries are married men and women with careers. Supernumeraries devote a portion of their day to prayer, in addition to attending regular meetings and taking part in activities such as retreats. Due to their career and family obligations, supernumeraries are not as available to the organization as the other types of faithful, but they typically contribute financially to Opus Dei, and they lend other types of assistance as their circumstances permit.\nNumeraries, the second largest type of the faithful of Opus Dei, comprise about 20% of the total membership. Numeraries are celibate members who give themselves in \"full availability\" (plena disponibilitas) for the official undertakings of the Prelature. This includes full availability for giving doctrinal and ascetical formation to other members, for staffing the internal government of Opus Dei if asked by the regional directors, and for moving to other countries to start or help with apostolic activities if asked by the prelate. Because they are making themselves fully available to do whatever needs to be done for the undertakings of the Prelature, numeraries are expected to live in special centers run by Opus Dei, and the question of which particular center a numerary will live in depends upon the regional needs. \"Numerary\" is a general term for persons who form part of the permanent staff of an organization. Therefore, in order to maintain a family atmosphere in the centers (rather than an institutional one), it is considered very important for numeraries to participate in daily meals and \"get-togethers\" in which they converse and share news. Both men and women may become numeraries in Opus Dei, although the centers are strictly gender-specific. Numeraries generally have jobs outside of Opus Dei, although some are asked to work internally full-time, and many modify the way that they go about their professional goals in order to be available for the Prelature. They devote the bulk of their income to the organization.\nNumerary assistants are a type of numerary that exists in the Women's Branch of Opus Dei. Their full availability for the Prelature is lived out as full availability for doing a specific type of work, namely looking after the domestic needs of the conference centers and the residential centers of Opus Dei. Hence they live in special centers run by Opus Dei and do not have jobs outside the centers.\nAssociates are celibate faithful who make themselves fully available to God and to others in apostolic celibacy and stably take on at least one (sometimes more) apostolic assignment(s) from the Prelature in giving doctrinal and ascetical formation and/or coordinating activities. They differ from numeraries in not making themselves \"fully\" available to staff the official undertakings of the Prelature, instead giving themselves in additional social realities, such as through their profession or to their own families. Because of this difference in availability for the official activities of Opus Dei, unlike numeraries the associates do not live in Opus Dei centers but maintain their own abodes. Some of their family life (emotional and social support) comes from the centers of Opus Dei, some from other associates of Opus Dei, and some from their personal families and friends; the precise ratio of this distribution depends upon the circumstances of the individual associate.\nThe Clergy of the Opus Dei Prelature are priests who are under the jurisdiction of the prelate of Opus Dei. They are a minority in Opus Dei—only about 2% of Opus Dei members are part of the clergy. Typically, they are numeraries or associates who ultimately joined the priesthood.\nThe Priestly Society of the Holy Cross consists of priests associated with Opus Dei. Part of the society is made up of the clergy of the Opus Dei prelature—priests who fall under the jurisdiction of the Opus Dei prelature are automatically members of the Priestly Society. Other members in the society are diocesan priests—clergymen who remain under the jurisdiction of a geographically defined diocese. These priests are considered full members of Opus Dei who are given its spiritual training. They do not, however, report to the Opus Dei prelate but to their own diocesan bishop. As of 2005, there were roughly two thousand of these priests.\nThe Cooperators of Opus Dei are non-members who collaborate in some way with Opus Dei—usually through praying, charitable contributions, or by providing some other assistance. Cooperators are not required to be celibate or to adhere to any other special requirements, and are not even required to be Christian. There were 164,000 cooperators in the year 2005.\nIn accordance with Catholic theology, membership is granted when a vocation or divine calling is presumed to have occurred.\n### Activities\nLeaders of Opus Dei describe the organization as a teaching entity whose main activity is to train Catholics to assume personal responsibility in sanctifying the secular world from within. This teaching is done by means of theory and practice.\nIts lay people and priests organize seminars, workshops, retreats, and classes to help people put the Christian faith into practice in their daily lives. Spiritual direction, one-on-one coaching with a more experienced lay person or priest, is considered the \"paramount means\" of training. Through these activities, they provide religious instruction (doctrinal formation), coaching in spirituality for lay people (spiritual formation), character and moral education (human formation), lessons in sanctifying one's work (professional formation), and know-how in evangelizing one's family and workplace (apostolic formation).\nThe official Catholic document, which established the prelature, states that Opus Dei strives \"to put into practice the teaching of the universal call to sanctity, and to promote at all levels of society the sanctification of ordinary work, and by means of ordinary work.\" Thus, the founder and his followers describe members of Opus Dei as resembling the members of the early Christian Church—ordinary workers who seriously sought holiness with nothing exterior to distinguish them from other citizens.\nOpus Dei runs residential centers throughout the world. These centers provide residential housing for celibate members and provide doctrinal and theological education. Opus Dei is also responsible for a variety of non-profit institutions called \"Corporate Works of Opus Dei.\" A study of the year 2005 showed that members have cooperated with other people in setting up a total of 608 social initiatives: schools and university residences (68%), technical or agricultural training centers (26%), universities, business schools, and hospitals (6%). The University of Navarra in Pamplona, Spain, and the Austral University in Buenos Aires, Argentina, are both examples of the corporate work of Opus Dei. These universities usually perform very high in international rankings. IESE, the University of Navarra's Business School, was adjudged one of the best in the world by the Financial Times and the Economist Intelligence Unit. The total assets of non-profits connected to Opus Dei are worth at least $2.8 billion.\n## Relations with Catholic leaders\nLeopoldo Eijo y Garay, the bishop of Madrid, where Opus Dei was born, supported Opus Dei and defended it in the 1940s by saying that \"this opus is truly Dei\" (this work is truly God's). Contrary to attacks of secrecy and heresy, the bishop described Opus Dei's founder as someone who was \"open as a child\" and \"most obedient to the Church hierarchy.\"\nIn the 1950s, Pope Pius XII told the most senior Australian bishop, Cardinal Norman Gilroy, that Escrivá \"is a true saint, a man sent by God for our times\". Pius XII gave Opus Dei the canonical status of \"]\", an institution depending directly and exclusively on the Vatican in its internal governance.\nIn 1960, Pope John XXIII commented that Opus Dei opens up \"unsuspected horizons of apostolate\". Furthermore, in 1964, Pope Paul VI praised the organization in a handwritten letter to Escrivá, saying:\nOpus Dei is \"a vigorous expression of the perennial youth of the Church, fully open to the demands of a modern apostolate... We look with paternal satisfaction on all that Opus Dei has achieved and is achieving for the kingdom of God, the desire of doing good that guides it, the burning love for the Church and its visible head that distinguishes it, and the ardent zeal for souls that impels it along the arduous and difficult paths of the apostolate of presence and witness in every sector of contemporary life.\"\nThe relationship between Paul VI and Opus Dei, according to Alberto Moncada, a doctor of sociology and ex-member, was \"stormy.\" After the Second Vatican Council concluded in 1965, Pope Paul VI denied Opus Dei's petition to become a personal prelature, Moncada stated.\nPope John Paul I, a few years before his election, wrote that Escrivá was more radical than other saints who taught about the universal call to holiness. While others emphasized monastic spirituality applied to lay people, Escrivá \"it is the material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity,\" thus providing a lay spirituality.\nCriticisms against Opus Dei have prompted Catholic scholars and writers like Piers Paul Read and Vittorio Messori to call Opus Dei a sign of contradiction, in reference to the biblical quote of Jesus as a \"sign that is spoken against\". John Carmel Heenan, Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster said \"One of the proofs of God's favor is to be a sign of contradiction. Almost all founders of societies in the Church have suffered. Monsignor Escrivá de Balaguer is no exception. Opus Dei has been attacked, and its motives misunderstood. In this country and elsewhere, an inquiry has always vindicated Opus Dei.\"\nOne of Opus Dei's most prominent supporters was Pope John Paul II. John Paul II cited Opus Dei's aim of sanctifying secular activities as a \"great ideal.\" He emphasized that Escrivá's founding of Opus Dei was ductus divina inspiratione, led by divine inspiration, and he granted the organization its status as a personal prelature. Stating that Escrivá is \"counted among the great witnesses of Christianity,\" John Paul II canonized him in 2002 and called him \"the saint of ordinary life.\" Of the organization, John Paul II said:\nhas as its aim the sanctification of one's life, while remaining within the world at one's place of work and profession: to live the Gospel in the world, while living immersed in the world, but in order to transform it, and to redeem it with one's personal love for Christ. This is truly a great ideal, which right from the beginning has anticipated the theology of the lay state of the Second Vatican Council and the post-conciliar period.\nOne-third of the world's bishops petitioned for the canonization of Escrivá. During the canonization, there were 42 cardinals and 470 bishops from around the world, generals superior of many religious institutes, and representatives of various Catholic groups. During those days, these church officials commented on the universal reach and validity of the message of the founder. For his canonization homily, John Paul II said: With the teachings of St. Josemaría, \"it is easier to understand what the Second Vatican Council affirmed: 'there is no question, then, of the Christian message inhibiting men from building up the world ... on the contrary, it is an incentive to do these very things' (Vatican II, Gaudium et spes, n. 34).\"\nConcerning the group's role in the Catholic Church, critics have argued that Opus Dei's unique status as a personal prelature gives it too much independence, making it essentially a \"church within a church\" and that Opus Dei exerts a disproportionately large influence within the Catholic Church itself, as illustrated, for example, by the rapid canonization of Escrivá, which some considered to be irregular (27 years). In contrast, Catholic officials say that church authorities have even greater control of Opus Dei now that its head is a prelate appointed by the Pope, and its status as a prelature \"precisely means dependence.\" Allen says that Escrivá's relatively quick canonization does not have anything to do with power but with improvements in procedures and John Paul II's decision to make Escrivá's sanctity and message known. The canonizations of John Paul II himself and Mother Teresa were much faster than Escrivá's.\nPope Benedict XVI has been a particularly strong supporter of Opus Dei and of Escrivá. Pointing to the name \"Work of God,\" Benedict XVI (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) wrote that \"The Lord simply made use of  who allowed God to work.\" Ratzinger cited Escrivá for correcting the mistaken idea that holiness is reserved for some extraordinary people who are completely different from ordinary sinners: Even if he can be very weak, with many mistakes in his life, a saint is nothing other than to speak with God as a friend speaks with a friend, allowing God to work, the Only One who can really make the world both good and happy.\nRatzinger spoke of Opus Dei's \"surprising union of absolute fidelity to the Church's great tradition, to its faith, and unconditional openness to all the challenges of this world, whether in the academic world, in the field of work, or in matters of the economy, etc.\" He further explained:\nthe theocentrism of Escrivá ... means this confidence in the fact that God is working now and we ought only to put ourselves at his disposal ... This, for me, is a message of greatest importance. It is a message that leads to overcoming what could be considered the great temptation of our times: the pretense that after the 'Big Bang' God retired from history.\nPope Francis is \"the first Pope who has dealt with Opus Dei closely as a bishop,\" and according to James V. Schall, S.J., is a \"friend of Opus Dei\". Francis referred to St. Josemaria as \"a precursor of Vatican II in proposing the universal call to holiness.\" In the analysis of John Allen, Pope Francis' strong dislike for clericalism, which he calls \"one of the worst evils\" in the church, is a key factor for \"what Francis admires about Opus Dei since Escrivá’s emphasis on the dignity of the laity was a challenge to the ultra-clerical ethos of Spanish Catholicism in the late 1920s.\" He has a devotion to St. Josemaria, and he prayed before his relics for 45 minutes when he once visited the church of the prelature in Rome. Francis beatified Alvaro del Portillo, the successor of Escrivá. What Bergoglio most liked about Opus Dei was the work done for the poor by one of its schools in Buenos Aires. He thanks Opus Dei for its work to further the holiness of priests in the Roman Curia.\n## Controversy\nThroughout its history, Opus Dei has been criticized from many quarters, prompting journalists to describe Opus Dei as \"the most controversial force in the Catholic Church\" and founder Josemaría Escrivá as a \"polarizing\" figure. Criticism of Opus Dei has centered on allegations of secretiveness, controversial and aggressive recruiting methods, strict rules governing members, elitism and misogyny, and support of or participation in authoritarian or right-wing governments, including the fascist Franco regime which governed in Spain until 1978. The mortification of the flesh practiced by some of its members is also criticized. Opus Dei has also been criticized for allegedly seeking independence and more influence within the Catholic Church.\nHowever, according to several journalists who have researched Opus Dei separately, many criticisms against Opus Dei are based on fabrications by opponents. Several popes and other Catholic leaders have endorsed what they see as its innovative teaching on the sanctifying value of work, and its fidelity to Catholic beliefs. In 2002, Pope John Paul II canonized Josemaría Escrivá, and called him \"the saint of ordinary life.\"\nIn recent years, Opus Dei has received international attention due to the novel The Da Vinci Code and its film version of 2006, both of which prominent Christians and non-believers criticized as misleading, inaccurate and anti-Catholic.\nCritics such as the Jesuit Wladimir Ledóchowski sometimes refer to Opus Dei as a Catholic (or Christian or \"white\") form of Freemasonry.\n### Supporting views\nAccording to several journalists who have worked independently on Opus Dei, such as John L. Allen Jr., Vittorio Messori, Patrice de Plunkett, Maggy Whitehouse, Noam Friedlander many of the criticisms against Opus Dei are myths and unproven tales. Allen, Messori, and Plunkett say that most of these myths were created by its opponents, with Allen adding that he perceives that Opus Dei members generally practice what they preach.\nAllen, Messori, and Plunkett also state that accusations that Opus Dei is secretive are unfounded. These accusations stem from a clerical paradigm which expects Opus Dei members to behave as monks and clerics, people who are traditionally known and externally identifiable as seekers of holiness. In contrast, these journalists continue, Opus Dei's lay members, like any normal Catholic professional, are ultimately responsible for their personal actions, and do not externally represent the organization which provides them religious education. Writer and broadcast analyst John L. Allen Jr. states that Opus Dei provides abundant information about itself. These journalists have stated that the historic roots of criticisms against Opus Dei can be found in influential clerical circles.\nAs to its alleged participation in right-wing politics, especially the Francoist regime, British historians Paul Preston and Brian Crozier state that the Opus Dei members who were Franco's ministers were appointed for their talent and not for their Opus Dei membership. Also, there were notable members of Opus Dei who were vocal critics of the Franco Regime such as Rafael Calvo Serer and Antonio Fontán, who was the first President of the Senate in Spain, following the adoption of a democratic Constitution. The German historian and Opus Dei member Peter Berglar calls any connection made between Opus Dei and Franco's regime a \"gross slander.\" At the end of Franco's regime, Opus Dei members were 50:50 for and against Franco, according to John Allen. Similarly Álvaro del Portillo, the former prelate of Opus Dei, said that any statements that Escrivá supported Hitler were \"a patent falsehood,\" that were part of \"a slanderous campaign\". He and others have stated that Escrivá condemned Hitler as a \"rogue\", a \"racist\" and a \"tyrant\". Opus Dei spokespersons also deny claims that Opus Dei members worked with General Pinochet. Various authors and researchers state that Escrivá was staunchly non-political, and detested dictatorships. Allen wrote that, compared with other Catholic organizations, Opus Dei's stress on freedom and personal responsibility is extraordinarily strong. There are many Opus Dei members who are identified with left-wing politics, including Ruth Kelly, Jorge Rossi Chavarría, Mario Fernández Baeza, Antonio Fontán, Mario Maiolo, and Jesus Estanislao.\nWhile Opus Dei spokespersons have admitted mistakes in dealing with some members and do not, as a rule, contest their grievances, supporters have rejected generalizations merely based on negative experiences of some members.\nOpus Dei is not \"elitist\" in the sense in which people often invoke the term, meaning an exclusively white-collar phenomenon, concluded John Allen. He observed that among its members are barbers, bricklayers, mechanics and fruit sellers. Most supernumeraries are living ordinary middle-class lives, he said.\nRegarding alleged misogyny, John Allen states that half of the leadership positions in Opus Dei are held by women, and they supervise men.\nAs regards the claim that religious people in Spain, including Opus Dei members, were involved in abduction of children during the Franco era, an investigation found that DNA analysis of 81 cases ruled out that they were stolen babies. The supreme court of Spain did not consider the first case of stolen babies to be proven, and the chief prosecutor of the Basque Country, said that \"not even reasonable evidence\" of any abduction of babies had been found, after special investigations of the police.\n### Criticism\nCritics of Opus Dei include María del Carmen Tapia, an ex-member who was a high-ranking officer of Opus Dei for many years, liberal Catholic theologians such as Fr. James Martin, a Jesuit writer and editor and supporters of Liberation theology, such as journalist Penny Lernoux and Michael Walsh, a writer on religious matters and former Jesuit.\nCritics state that Opus Dei is \"intensely secretive\"—for example, members generally do not disclose their affiliation with Opus Dei in public. Further, under the 1950 constitution, members were expressly forbidden to reveal themselves without the permission of their superiors. This practice has led to much speculation about who may be a member. Due in part to its secrecy, the Jesuit-run magazine America referred to it as, \"....the most controversial group in the Catholic Church today.\"\nOpus Dei has been accused of deceptive and aggressive recruitment practices, such as showering potential members with intense praise (\"Love bombing\"), and instructing numeraries to form friendships and attend social gatherings explicitly for recruiting purposes.\nCritics allege that Opus Dei maintains an extremely high degree of control over its members—for instance, past rules required numeraries to submit their incoming and outgoing mail to their superiors for inspection, and members are forbidden to read certain books without permission from their superiors. Critics charge that Opus Dei pressures numeraries to sever contact with non-members, including their own families. Exit counselor David Clark has described Opus Dei as \"very cult-like\".\nCritics assert that Escrivá and the organization supported radical right-wing governments, such as those of Franco, Augusto Pinochet and Alberto Fujimori of Peru during the 1990s. Both Pinochet's and Fujimori's ministries and prominent supporters allegedly included members of Opus Dei, but there are also prominent Opus Dei members in parties that opposed those governments. Likewise, among Opus Dei members there were also strong detractors of Franco, such as Antonio Fontán. There have also been allegations that Escrivá expressed sympathy for Adolf Hitler. One former Opus Dei priest, Vladimir Felzmann, who has become a vocal Opus Dei critic, says that Escrivá once remarked that Hitler had been \"badly treated\" by the world and he further declared that \"Hitler couldn't have been such a bad person. He couldn't have killed six million . It couldn't have been more than four million.\"\nOpus Dei has also been accused of elitism through targeting of \"the intellectual elite, the well-to-do, and the socially prominent.\"\nAs members of Opus Dei are Catholics, Opus Dei has been subjected to the same criticisms targeted to Catholicism in general. For example, Opus Dei's position has been \"to oppose sexual freedoms and promote conservative morals,\" according to an investigative report produced by the advocacy group Catholics for Choice. The report further cites a study from sociologist Marco Burgos alleging Opus Dei interference in sex education programs in Honduras that contradict the Catholic faith.\nBetween 1950 and 1980, as many as 300,000 illegal adoptions occurred in Spain in a scandal known as the Lost children of Francoism. Many Catholic clergy and religious sisters at church-sponsored hospitals or other charitable organizations in Spain are alleged to have been involved, including members of Opus Dei.\nThe Opus Dei organisation has been described as a \"Holy Mafia\" or \"Santa Mafia\" in the 1970s due to alleged \"inscrutable business practices\".\nAfter conducting a critical study of Opus Dei, Catholic journalist John L. Allen Jr. concluded that Opus Dei should (1) be more transparent, (2) collaborate with members of religious institutes, and (3) encourage its members to air out in public their criticisms of the institution.\n### Other views\nSociologists Peter Berger and Samuel Huntington suggest that Opus Dei is involved in \"a deliberate attempt to construct an alternative modernity,\" one that engages modern culture while at the same time is resolutely loyal to Catholic traditions. Van Biema of Time magazine emphasises Opus Dei's Spanish roots as a source of misunderstandings in the Anglo-Saxon world, and suggests that as the United States becomes more Hispanic, controversies about Opus Dei (and similar Catholic organizations) will decrease.\nIn her 2006 book on Opus Dei, Maggy Whitehouse, a non-Catholic journalist, argues that the relative autonomy of each director and center has resulted in mistakes at the local level. She recommends greater consistency and transparency for Opus Dei, which she sees as having learned the lesson of greater openness when it faced the issues raised by The Da Vinci Code and other critics.", "Opus Dei, (Latin: “Work of God”) in full Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei, Roman Catholic lay and clerical organization whose members seek personal Christian perfection and strive to implement Christian ideals and values in their occupations and in society as a whole. Theologically conservative, Opus Dei accepts the teaching authority of the church without question and has long been the subject of controversy; it has been accused of secrecy, cultlike practices, and political ambitions. ## History and organization\nOpus Dei was founded in 1928 in Spain by St. Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer y Albás (canonized in 2002), a priest trained in law. Believing that daily life can be sanctifying, Escrivá sought to encourage Catholic laypeople and priests in their pursuit of holiness through their chosen professions. Opus Dei was formally approved by the Holy See in 1950 as a secular institute (i.e., a new form of religious association whose members “profess the evangelical counsels in secular life”). On November 28, 1982, Pope John Paul II, a staunch supporter of Opus Dei, established it as the first and only personal prelature in the church, with jurisdiction over people rather than a geographic area. With separate branches for men and women, the organization has been headed since 1982 by a prelate elected by its members. The prelate can establish seminaries and promote students to holy orders, but the organization remains subject to some oversight by local bishops.\n## Membership and activities\nOpus Dei originally required new members to take a vow of obedience and chastity. Since the organization became a prelature, however, it has required only a contractual commitment to receive spiritual formation, which includes weekly classes (“circles”) and an annual religious retreat, among other activities. Members commonly practice self-sacrifice, which can include fasting and abstinence from certain pleasures, and self-mortification, such as the wearing of a cilice (which often takes the form of a spiked chain worn around the upper thigh), is not discouraged. New members serve a period of probation, which lasts at least five years, before they are fully admitted. Some members of Opus Dei, called numeraries, devote much of their time to the organization. Like priests, they are required to remain unmarried and celibate, but they live in the world and pursue secular occupations. The majority of members, however, are the supernumeraries, who are free to marry, contribute financially to Opus Dei, and demonstrate Christian virtue in their daily activities. The group is also financially assisted by cooperators, who are not members and, by permission of the Holy See, need not even be Christians. Ordained priests constitute only a tiny percentage of the organization; in 2016 they numbered some 2,100 of the almost 95,000 members worldwide.\nThe organization has established vocational, trade, home-arts, and agricultural centres in various parts of the world, numerous high schools, schools of business administration, and charitable activities. Opus Dei also founded and endowed (with government assistance) the University of Navarra, which is regarded by many as Spain’s finest university, and operates the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in Rome and the University of Piura in Peru.\n## Controversies\nBecause Opus Dei included many highly educated people, Spain’s leader Generalissimo Francisco Franco involved several of its members in instituting economic reform in 1956, and among his ministers were members of Opus Dei. This led many to speculate that the group had political and economic ambitions, though Opus Dei’s influence waned in Spain as other groups entered the political arena after Franco’s death in 1975.\nAggressive recruiting practices, the brainwashing of new recruits, and the isolation of members from their families are among the charges often leveled against the organization. Membership is usually kept secret, which has fueled allegations that the group operates as a cult or elite secret society. Pointing to its continued growth, Opus Dei denies these accusations and has the continued support of the Vatican."], "selected_questions": ["What is the organizational structure of Opus Dei?", "What are the different types of members in Opus Dei and what are their responsibilities?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Opus Dei is organized as a personal prelature, with separate branches for men and women.

{"name": "Shale gas", "documents": ["# Shale gas\nShale gas is an unconventional natural gas that is found trapped within shale formations. Since the 1990s a combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has made large volumes of shale gas more economical to produce, and some analysts expect that shale gas will greatly expand worldwide energy supply.\nShale gas has become an increasingly important source of natural gas in the United States since the start of this century, and interest has spread to potential gas shales in the rest of the world. China is estimated to have the world's largest shale gas reserves.\nA 2013 review by the United Kingdom Department of Energy and Climate Change noted that most studies of the subject have estimated that life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shale gas are similar to those of conventional natural gas, and are much less than those from coal, usually about half the greenhouse gas emissions of coal; the noted exception was a 2011 study by Howarth and others of Cornell University, which concluded that shale GHG emissions were as high as those of coal. More recent studies have also concluded that life-cycle shale gas GHG emissions are much less than those of coal, among them, studies by Natural Resources Canada (2012), and a consortium formed by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory with a number of universities (2012).\nSome 2011 studies pointed to high rates of decline of some shale gas wells as an indication that shale gas production may ultimately be much lower than is currently projected. But shale-gas discoveries are also opening up substantial new resources of tight oil, also known as \"shale oil\".\n## History\n### United States\nShale gas was first extracted as a resource in Fredonia, New York, in 1821, in shallow, low-pressure fractures. Horizontal drilling began in the 1930s, and in 1947 a well was first fracked in the U.S.\nFederal price controls on natural gas led to shortages in the 1970s. Faced with declining natural gas production, the federal government invested in many supply alternatives, including the Eastern Gas Shales Project, which lasted from 1976 to 1992, and the annual FERC-approved research budget of the Gas Research Institute, where the federal government began extensive research funding in 1982, disseminating the results to industry. The federal government also provided tax credits and rules benefiting the industry in the 1980 Energy Act. The Department of Energy later partnered with private gas companies to complete the first successful air-drilled multi-fracture horizontal well in shale in 1986. The federal government further incentivized drilling in shale via the Section 29 tax credit for unconventional gas from 1980–2000. Microseismic imaging, a crucial input to both hydraulic fracturing in shale and offshore oil drilling, originated from coalbeds research at Sandia National Laboratories. The DOE program also applied two technologies that had been developed previously by industry, massive hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, to shale gas formations, which led to microseismic imaging.\nAlthough the Eastern Gas Shales Project had increased gas production in the Appalachian and Michigan basins, shale gas was still widely seen as marginal to uneconomic without tax credits, and shale gas provided only 1.6% of US gas production in 2000, when the federal tax credits expired.\nGeorge P. Mitchell is regarded as the father of the shale gas industry, since he made it commercially viable in the Barnett Shale by getting costs down to $4 per 1 million British thermal units (1,100 megajoules). Mitchell Energy achieved the first economical shale fracture in 1998 using slick-water fracturing. Since then, natural gas from shale has been the fastest growing contributor to total primary energy in the United States, and has led many other countries to pursue shale deposits. According to the IEA, shale gas could increase technically recoverable natural gas resources by almost 50%.\nIn 2000 shale gas provided only 1% of U.S. natural gas production; by 2010 it was over 20% and the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted that by 2035, 46% of the United States' natural gas supply will come from shale gas.\nThe Obama administration believed that increased shale gas development would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n## Geology\nBecause shales ordinarily have insufficient permeability to allow significant fluid flow to a wellbore, most shales are not commercial sources of natural gas. Shale gas is one of a number of unconventional sources of natural gas; others include coalbed methane, tight sandstones, and methane hydrates. Shale gas areas are often known as resource plays (as opposed to exploration plays). The geological risk of not finding gas is low in resource plays, but the potential profits per successful well are usually also lower.\nShale has low matrix permeability, and so gas production in commercial quantities requires fractures to provide permeability. Shale gas has been produced for years from shales with natural fractures; the shale gas boom in recent years has been due to modern technology in hydraulic fracturing (fracking) to create extensive artificial fractures around well bores.\nHorizontal drilling is often used with shale gas wells, with lateral lengths up to 10,000 feet (3,000 m) within the shale, to create maximum borehole surface area in contact with the shale.\nShales that host economic quantities of gas have a number of common properties. They are rich in organic material (0.5% to 25%), and are usually mature petroleum source rocks in the thermogenic gas window, where high heat and pressure have converted petroleum to natural gas. They are sufficiently brittle and rigid enough to maintain open fractures.\nSome of the gas produced is held in natural fractures, some in pore spaces, and some is adsorbed onto the shale matrix. Further, the adsorption of gas is a process of physisorption, exothermic and spontaneous. The gas in the fractures is produced immediately; the gas adsorbed onto organic material is released as the formation pressure is drawn down by the well.\n## Shale gas by country\nAlthough the shale gas potential of many nations is being studied, as of 2013, only the US, Canada, and China produce shale gas in commercial quantities, and only the US and Canada have significant shale gas production. While China has ambitious plans to dramatically increase its shale gas production, these efforts have been checked by inadequate access to technology, water, and land.\nThe table below is based on data collected by the Energy Information Administration agency of the United States Department of Energy. Numbers for the estimated amount of \"technically recoverable\" shale gas resources are provided alongside numbers for proven natural gas reserves.\nThe US EIA had made an earlier estimate of total recoverable shale gas in various countries in 2011, which for some countries differed significantly from the 2013 estimates. The total recoverable shale gas in the United States, which was estimated at 862 trillion cubic feet in 2011, was revised downward to 665 trillion cubic feet in 2013. Recoverable shale gas in Canada, which was estimated to be 388 TCF in 2011, was revised upward to 573 TCF in 2013.\nFor the United States, EIA estimated (2013) a total \"wet natural gas\" resource of 2,431 tcf, including both shale and conventional gas. Shale gas was estimated to be 27% of the total resource. \"Wet natural gas\" is methane plus natural gas liquids, and is more valuable than dry gas.\nFor the rest of the world (excluding US), EIA estimated (2013) a total wet natural gas resource of 20,451 trillion cubic feet (579.1×10^12 m3). Shale gas was estimated to be 32% of the total resource.\nEurope has a shale gas resource estimate of 639 trillion cubic feet (18.1×10^12 m3) compared with America's reserves 862 trillion cubic feet (24.4×10^12 m3), but its geology is more complicated and the oil and gas more expensive to extract, with a well likely to cost as much as three-and-a-half times more than one in the United States. Europe would be the fastest growing region, accounting for the highest CAGR of 59.5%, in terms of volume owing to availability of shale gas resource estimates in more than 14 European countries.\n## Environment\nThe extraction and use of shale gas can affect the environment through the leaking of extraction chemicals and waste into water supplies, the leaking of greenhouse gases during extraction, and the pollution caused by the improper processing of natural gas. A challenge to preventing pollution is that shale gas extractions varies widely in this regard, even between different wells in the same project; the processes that reduce pollution sufficiently in one extraction may not be enough in another.\nIn 2013 the European Parliament agreed that environmental impact assessments will not be mandatory for shale gas exploration activities and shale gas extraction activities will be subject to the same terms as other gas extraction projects.\n### Climate\nBarack Obama's administration had sometimes promoted shale gas, in part because of its belief that it releases fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than other fossil fuels. In a 2010 letter to President Obama, Martin Apple of the Council of Scientific Society Presidents cautioned against a national policy of developing shale gas without a more certain scientific basis for the policy. This umbrella organization that represents 1.4 million scientists noted that shale gas development \"may have greater GHG emissions and environmental costs than previously appreciated.\"\nIn late 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a report which concluded that shale gas emits larger amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than does conventional gas, but still far less than coal. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, although it stays in the atmosphere for only one tenth as long a period as carbon dioxide. Recent evidence suggests that methane has a global warming potential (GWP) that is 105-fold greater than carbon dioxide when viewed over a 20-year period and 33-fold greater when viewed over a 100-year period, compared mass-to-mass.\nSeveral studies which have estimated lifecycle methane leakage from shale gas development and production have found a wide range of leakage rates, from less than 1% of total production to nearly 8%.\nA 2011 study published in Climatic Change Letters claimed that the production of electricity using shale gas may lead to as much or more life-cycle GWP than electricity generated with oil or coal. In the peer-reviewed paper, Cornell University professor Robert W. Howarth, a marine ecologist, and colleagues claimed that once methane leak and venting impacts are included, the life-cycle greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas is far worse than those of coal and fuel oil when viewed for the integrated 20-year period after emission. On the 100-year integrated time frame, this analysis claims shale gas is comparable to coal and worse than fuel oil. However, other studies have pointed out flaws with the paper and come to different conclusions. Among those are assessments by experts at the U.S. Department of Energy, peer-reviewed studies by Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Maryland, and the Natural Resources Defense Council, which claimed that the Howarth et al. paper's use of a 20-year time horizon for global warming potential of methane is \"too short a period to be appropriate for policy analysis.\" In January 2012, Howarth's colleagues at Cornell University, Lawrence Cathles et al., responded with their own peer-reviewed assessment, noting that the Howarth paper was \"seriously flawed\" because it \"significantly overestimate the fugitive emissions associated with unconventional gas extraction, undervalue the contribution of 'green technologies' to reducing those emissions to a level approaching that of conventional gas, base their comparison between gas and coal on heat rather than electricity generation (almost the sole use of coal), and assume a time interval over which to compute the relative climate impact of gas compared to coal that does not capture the contrast between the long residence time of CO2 and the short residence time of methane in the atmosphere.\" The author of that response, Lawrence Cathles, wrote that \"shale gas has a GHG footprint that is half and perhaps a third that of coal,\" based upon \"more reasonable leakage rates and bases of comparison.\"\nIn April 2013 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lowered its estimate of how much methane leaks from wells, pipelines and other facilities during production and delivery of natural gas by 20 percent. The EPA report on greenhouse emissions credited tighter pollution controls instituted by the industry for cutting an average of 41.6 million metric tons of methane emissions annually from 1990 through 2010, a reduction of more than 850 million metric tons overall. The Associated Press noted that \"The EPA revisions came even though natural gas production has grown by nearly 40 percent since 1990.\"\nUsing data from the Environmental Protection Agency's 2013 Greenhouse Gas Inventory yields a methane leakage rate of about 1.4%, down from 2.3% from the EPA's previous Inventory.\nA five-year set of studies coordinated by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and released 2018, found that methane leaks in the U.S. are 60% higher than estimates by the EPA. The study, which was conducted by researchers from 40 institutions, estimated a 2.3% methane leak rate, \"enough to erode much of the climate advantage gas has over coal\".\n### Life cycle comparison for more than global warming potential\nA 2014 study from Manchester University presented the \"First full life cycle assessment of shale gas used for electricity generation.\" By full life cycle assessment, the authors explained that they mean the evaluation of nine environmental factors beyond the commonly performed evaluation of global warming potential. The authors concluded that, in line with most of the published studies for other regions, that shale gas in the United Kingdom would have a global warming potential \"broadly similar\" to that of conventional North Sea gas, although shale gas has the potential to be higher if fugitive methane emissions are not controlled, or if per-well ultimate recoveries in the UK are small. For the other parameters, the highlighted conclusions were that, for shale gas in the United Kingdom in comparison with coal, conventional and liquefied gas, nuclear, wind and solar (PV).\nShale gas worse than coal for three impacts and better than renewables for four. It has higher photochemical smog and terrestrial toxicity than the other options. Shale gas a sound environmental option only if accompanied by stringent regulation.\nDr James Verdon has published a critique of the data produced, and the variables that may affect the results.\n### Water and air quality\nChemicals are added to the water to facilitate the underground fracturing process that releases natural gas. Fracturing fluid is primarily water and approximately 0.5% chemical additives (friction reducer, agents countering rust, agents killing microorganism). Since (depending on the size of the area) millions of liters of water are used, this means that hundreds of thousands of liters of chemicals are often injected into the subsurface. About 50% to 70% of the injected volume of contaminated water is recovered and stored in above-ground ponds to await removal by tanker. The remaining volume remains in the subsurface. Hydraulic fracturing opponents fear that it can lead to contamination of groundwater aquifers, though the industry deems this \"highly unlikely\". However, foul-smelling odors and heavy metals contaminating the local water supply above-ground have been reported.\nBesides using water and industrial chemicals, it is also possible to frack shale gas with only liquified propane gas. This reduces the environmental degradation considerably. The method was invented by GasFrac, of Alberta, Canada.\nHydraulic fracturing was exempted from the Safe Drinking Water Act in the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\nA study published in May 2011 concluded that shale gas wells have seriously contaminated shallow groundwater supplies in northeastern Pennsylvania with flammable methane. However, the study does not discuss how pervasive such contamination might be in other areas drilled for shale gas.\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced 23 June 2011 that it will examine claims of water pollution related to hydraulic fracturing in Texas, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Colorado and Louisiana. On 8 December 2011, the EPA issued a draft finding which stated that groundwater contamination in Pavillion, Wyoming may be the result of fracking in the area. The EPA stated that the finding was specific to the Pavillion area, where the fracking techniques differ from those used in other parts of the U.S. Doug Hock, a spokesman for the company which owns the Pavillion gas field, said that it is unclear whether the contamination came from the fracking process. Wyoming's Governor Matt Mead called the EPA draft report \"scientifically questionable\" and stressed the need for additional testing. The Casper Star-Tribune also reported on 27 December 2011, that the EPA's sampling and testing procedures \"didn’t follow their own protocol\" according to Mike Purcell, the director of the Wyoming Water Development Commission.\nA 2011 study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that \"The environmental impacts of shale development are challenging but manageable.\" The study addressed groundwater contamination, noting \"There has been concern that these fractures can also penetrate shallow freshwater zones and contaminate them with fracturing fluid, but there is no evidence that this is occurring\". This study blames known instances of methane contamination on a small number of sub-standard operations, and encourages the use of industry best practices to prevent such events from recurring.\nIn a report dated 25 July 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that it had completed its testing of private drinking water wells in Dimock, Pennsylvania. Data previously supplied to the agency by residents, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and Cabot Oil and Gas Exploration had indicated levels of arsenic, barium or manganese in well water at five homes at levels that could present a health concern. In response, water treatment systems that can reduce concentrations of those hazardous substances to acceptable levels at the tap were installed at affected homes. Based on the outcome of sampling after the treatment systems were installed, the EPA concluded that additional action by the Agency was not required.\nA Duke University study of Blacklick Creek (Pennsylvania), carried out over two years, took samples from the creek upstream and down stream of the discharge point of Josephine Brine Treatment Facility. Radium levels in the sediment at the discharge point are around 200 times the amount upstream of the facility. The radium levels are \"above regulated levels\" and present the \"danger of slow bio-accumulation\" eventually in fish. The Duke study \"is the first to use isotope hydrology to connect the dots between shale gas waste, treatment sites and discharge into drinking water supplies.\" The study recommended \"independent monitoring and regulation\" in the United States due to perceived deficiencies in self-regulation.\nWhat is happening is the direct result of a lack of any regulation. If the Clean Water Act was applied in 2005 when the shale gas boom started this would have been prevented. In the UK, if shale gas is going to develop, it should not follow the American example and should impose environmental regulation to prevent this kind of radioactive buildup.— Avner Vengosh\nAccording to the US Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Water Act applies to surface stream discharges from shale gas wells:\n### Earthquakes\nHydraulic fracturing routinely produces microseismic events much too small to be detected except by sensitive instruments. These microseismic events are often used to map the horizontal and vertical extent of the fracturing. However, as of late 2012, there have been three known instances worldwide of hydraulic fracturing, through induced seismicity, triggering quakes large enough to be felt by people.\nOn 26 April 2012, the Asahi Shimbun reported that United States Geological Survey scientists have been investigating the recent increase in the number of magnitude 3 and greater earthquake in the midcontinent of the United States. Beginning in 2001, the average number of earthquakes occurring per year of magnitude 3 or greater increased significantly, culminating in a six-fold increase in 2011 over 20th century levels. A researcher in Center for Earthquake Research and Information of University of Memphis assumes water pushed back into the fault tends to cause earthquake by slippage of fault.\nOver 109 small earthquakes (Mw 0.4–3.9) were detected during January 2011 to February 2012 in the Youngstown, Ohio area, where there were no known earthquakes in the past. These shocks were close to a deep fluid injection well. The 14 month seismicity included six felt earthquakes and culminated with a Mw 3.9 shock on 31 December 2011. Among the 109 shocks, 12 events greater than Mw 1.8 were detected by regional network and accurately relocated, whereas 97 small earthquakes (0.4<Mw<1.8) were detected by the waveform correlation detector. Accurately located earthquakes were along a subsurface fault trending ENE-WSW—consistent with the focal mechanism of the main shock and occurred at depths 3.5–4.0 km in the Precambrian basement.\nOn 19 June 2012, the United States Senate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources held a hearing entitled, \"Induced Seismicity Potential in Energy Technologies.\" Dr. Murray Hitzman, the Charles F. Fogarty Professor of Economic Geology in the Department of Geology and Geological Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, CO testified that \"About 35,000 hydraulically fractured shale gas wells exist in the United States. Only one case of felt seismicity in the United States has been described in which hydraulic fracturing for shale gas development is suspected, but not confirmed. Globally only one case of felt induced seismicity at Blackpool, England has been confirmed as being caused by hydraulic fracturing for shale gas development.\"\n### The relative impacts of natural gas and coal\n#### Human health impacts\nA comprehensive review of the public health effects of energy fuel cycles in Europe finds that coal causes 6 to 98 deaths per TWh (average 25 deaths per TWh), compared to natural gas’ 1 to 11 deaths per TWh (average 3 deaths per TWh). These numbers include both accidental deaths and pollution-related deaths. Coal mining is one of the most dangerous professions in the United States, resulting in between 20 and 40 deaths annually, compared to between 10 and 20 for oil and gas extraction. Worker accident risk is also far higher with coal than gas. In the United States, the oil and gas extraction industry is associated with one to two injuries per 100 workers each year. Coal mining, on the other hand, contributes to four injuries per 100 workers each year. Coal mines collapse, and can take down roads, water and gas lines, buildings and many lives with them.\nAverage damages from coal pollutants are two orders of magnitude larger than damages from natural gas. SO2, NOx, and particulate matter from coal plants create annual damages of $156 million per plant compared to $1.5 million per gas plant. Coal-fired power plants in the United States emit 17–40 times more SOx emissions per MWh than natural gas, and 1–17 times as much NOx per MWh. Lifecycle CO2 emissions from coal plants are 1.8-2.3 times greater (per KWh) than natural gas emissions.\nThe air quality advantages of natural gas over coal have been borne out in Pennsylvania, according to studies by the RAND Corporation and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The shale boom in Pennsylvania has led to dramatically lower emissions of sulfur dioxide, fine particulates, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\nPhysicist Richard A. Muller has said that the public health benefits from shale gas, by displacing harmful air pollution from coal, far outweigh its environmental costs. In a 2013 report for the Centre for Policy Studies, Muller wrote that air pollution, mostly from coal burning, kills over three million people each year, primarily in the developing world. The report states that \"Environmentalists who oppose the development of shale gas and fracking are making a tragic mistake.\" In China, shale gas development is seen as a way to shift away from coal and decrease serious air pollution problems created by burning coal.\n#### Social impacts\nShale gas development leads to a series of tiered socio-economic effects during boom conditions. These include both positive and negative aspects. Along with other forms of unconventional energy, shale oil and gas extraction has three direct initial aspects: increased labour demand (employment); income generation (higher wages); and disturbance to land and/or other economic activity, potentially resulting in compensation. Following these primary direct effects, the following secondary effects occur: in-migration (to meet labour demand), attracting temporary and/or permanent residents, Increased demand for goods and services; leading to increased indirect employment. The latter two of these can fuel each other in a circular relationship during boom conditions (i.e. increased demand for goods and services creates employment which increase demand for goods and services). These increases place strain on existing infrastructure. These conditions lead to tertiary socio-economic effects in the form of increased housing values; increased rental costs; construction of new dwellings (which may take time to be completed); demographic and cultural changes as new types of people move to the host region; changes to income distribution; potential for conflict; potential for increased substance abuse; and provision of new types of services. The reverse of these effects occurs over bust conditions, with a decline in primary effects leading to a decline in secondary effects and so on. However, the bust period of unconventional extraction may not be as severe as from conventional energy extraction. Due to the dispersed nature of the industry and ability to adjust drilling rates, there is debate in the literature as to how intense the bust phase is and how host communities can maintain social resilience during downturns.\n#### Landscape impacts\nCoal mining radically alters whole mountain and forest landscapes. Beyond the coal removed from the earth, large areas of forest are turned inside out and blackened with toxic and radioactive chemicals. There have been reclamation successes, but hundreds of thousands of acres of abandoned surface mines in the United States have not been reclaimed, and reclamation of certain terrain (including steep terrain) is nearly impossible.\nWhere coal exploration requires altering landscapes far beyond the area where the coal is, aboveground natural gas equipment takes up just one percent of the total surface land area from where gas will be extracted. The environmental impact of gas drilling has changed radically in recent years. Vertical wells into conventional formations used to take up one-fifth of the surface area above the resource, a twenty-fold higher impact than current horizontal drilling requires. A six-acre horizontal drill pad can thus extract gas from an underground area 1,000 acres in size.\nThe impact of natural gas on landscapes is even less and shorter in duration than the impact of wind turbines. The footprint of a shale gas derrick (3–5 acres) is only a little larger than the land area necessary for a single wind turbine. But it requires less concrete, stands one-third as tall, and is present for just 30 days instead of 20–30 years. Between 7 and 15 weeks are spent setting up the drill pad and completing the actual hydraulic fracture. At that point, the drill pad is removed, leaving behind a single garage-sized wellhead that remains for the lifetime of the well. A study published in 2015 on the Fayetteville Shale found that a mature gas field impacted about 2% of the land area and substantially increased edge habitat creation. Average land impact per well was 3 hectares (about 7 acres)\n#### Water\nWith coal mining, waste materials are piled at the surface of the mine, creating aboveground runoff that pollutes and alters the flow of regional streams. As rain percolates through waste piles, soluble components are dissolved in the runoff and cause elevated total dissolved solids (TDS) levels in local water bodies. Sulfates, calcium, carbonates and bicarbonates – the typical runoff products of coalmine waste materials – make water unusable for industry or agriculture and undrinkable for humans. Acid mine wastewater can drain into groundwater, causing significant contamination. Explosive blasting in a mine can cause groundwater to seep to lower-than-normal depths or connect two aquifers that were previously distinct, exposing both to contamination by mercury, lead, and other toxic heavy metals.\nContamination of surface waterways and groundwater with fracking fluids is problematic. Shale gas deposits are generally several thousand feet below ground. There have been instances of methane migration, improper treatment of recovered wastewater, and pollution via reinjection wells.\nIn most cases, the life-cycle water intensity and pollution associated with coal production and combustion far outweigh those related to shale gas production. Coal resource production requires at least twice as much water per million British thermal units compared to shale gas production. And while regions like Pennsylvania have experienced an absolute increase in water demand for energy production thanks to the shale boom, shale wells actually produce less than half the wastewater per unit of energy compared to conventional natural gas.\nCoal-fired power plants consume two to five times as much water as natural gas plants. Where 520–1040 gallons of water are required per MWh of coal, gas-fired combined cycle power requires 130–500 gallons per MWh. The environmental impact of water consumption at the point of power generation depends on the type of power plant: plants either use evaporative cooling towers to release excess heat or discharge water to nearby rivers. Natural gas combined-cycle power (NGCC), which captures the exhaust heat generated by combusting natural gas to power a steam generator, are considered the most efficient large-scale thermal power plants. One study found that the life-cycle demand for water from coal power in Texas could be more than halved by switching the fleet to NGCC.\nAll told, shale gas development in the United States represents less than half a percent of total domestic freshwater consumption, although this portion can reach as high as 25 percent in particularly arid regions.\n## Hazards\nDrilling depths of 1,000 to 3,000 m, then injection of a fluid composed of water, sand and detergents under pressure (600 bar), are required to fracture the rock and release the gas. These operations have already caused groundwater contaminations across the Atlantic, mainly as a result of hydrocarbon leakage along the casings. In addition, between 2% and 8% of the extracted fuel would be released to the atmosphere at wells (still in the United States). However, it is mainly composed of methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas that is considerably more powerful than CO2.\nSurface installations must be based on concrete or paved soils connected to the road network. A gas pipeline is also required to evacuate production. In total, each farm would occupy an average area of 3.6 ha. However, the gas fields are relatively small. Exploitation of shale gas could therefore lead to fragmentation of landscapes. Finally, a borehole requires about 20 million liters of water, the daily consumption of about 100,000 inhabitants.\n## Economics\nAlthough shale gas has been produced for more than 100 years in the Appalachian Basin and the Illinois Basin of the United States, the wells were often marginally economic. Advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal completions have made shale-gas wells more profitable. Improvements in moving drilling rigs between nearby locations, and the use of single well pads for multiple wells have increased the productivity of drilling shale gas wells. As of June 2011, the validity of the claims of economic viability of these wells has begun to be publicly questioned. Shale gas tends to cost more to produce than gas from conventional wells, because of the expense of the massive hydraulic fracturing treatments required to produce shale gas, and of horizontal drilling.\nThe cost of extracting offshore shale gas in the UK were estimated to be more than $200 per barrel of oil equivalent (UK North Sea oil prices were about $120 per barrel in April 2012). However, no cost figures were made public for onshore shale gas.\nNorth America has been the leader in developing and producing shale gas. The economic success of the Barnett Shale play in Texas in particular has spurred the search for other sources of shale gas across the United States and Canada,\nSome Texas residents think fracking is using too much of their groundwater, but drought and other growing uses are also part of the causes of the water shortage there.\nA Visiongain research report calculated the 2011 worth of the global shale-gas market as $26.66 billion.\nA 2011 New York Times investigation of industrial emails and internal documents found that the financial benefits of unconventional shale gas extraction may be less than previously thought, due to companies intentionally overstating the productivity of their wells and the size of their reserves. The article was criticized by, among others, the New York Times' own Public Editor for lack of balance in omitting facts and viewpoints favorable to shale gas production and economics.\nIn first quarter 2012, the United States imported 840 billion cubic feet (Bcf) (785 from Canada) while exporting 400 Bcf (mostly to Canada); both mainly by pipeline. Almost none is exported by ship as LNG, as that would require expensive facilities. In 2012, prices went down to US$3 per million British thermal units ($10/MWh) due to shale gas.\nA recent academic paper on the economic impacts of shale gas development in the US finds that natural gas prices have dropped dramatically in places with shale deposits with active exploration. Natural gas for industrial use has become cheaper by around 30% compared to the rest of the US. This stimulates local energy intensive manufacturing growth, but brings the lack of adequate pipeline capacity in the US in sharp relief.\nOne of the byproducts of shale gas exploration is the opening up of deep underground shale deposits to \"tight oil\" or shale oil production. By 2035, shale oil production could \"boost the world economy by up to $2.7 trillion, a PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report says. It has the potential to reach up to 12 percent of the world’s total oil production — touching 14 million barrels a day — \"revolutionizing\" the global energy markets over the next few decades.\"\nAccording to a 2013 Forbes magazine article, generating electricity by burning natural gas is cheaper than burning coal if the price of gas remains below US$3 per million British thermal units ($10/MWh) or about $3 per 1000 cubic feet. Also in 2013, Ken Medlock, Senior Director of the Baker Institute's Center for Energy Studies, researched US shale gas break-even prices. \"Some wells are profitable at $2.65 per thousand cubic feet, others need $8.10…the median is $4.85,\" Medlock said. Energy consultant Euan Mearns estimates that, for the US, \"minimum costs  in the range $4 to $6 / mcf. .\"", "![Learn how the United Kingdom measures the safety and the impact on energy security of extracting shale gas via fracking\n{  \"sources\": [ { \"file\" : \"//content.jwplatform.com/manifests/P73aBPJs.m3u8\" } ],  \"image\": \"https://cdn.britannica.com/81/187581-138-1FE591E3/ways-safety-profitability-United-Kingdom-fracking-shale.jpg\"    ,\"tracks\": [ { \"file\" : \"//assets-jpcust.jwpsrv.com/tracks/caJmKXC3\", \"label\": \"English\" } ]    ,\"adfile\": \"//content.jwplatform.com/manifests/V9u1r9lj.m3u8\"    }](/video/187581/ways-safety-profitability-United-Kingdom-fracking-shale)\nLearn how the United Kingdom measures the safety and the impact on energy security of extracting shale gas via fracking [See all videos for this article](/science/shale-gas/images-videos)\nshale gas, natural gas obtained from sheetlike formations of shale, frequently at depths exceeding 1,500 metres (5,000 feet). Shales are fine-grained sedimentary rocks consisting of silt- and clay-sized particles that were laid down hundreds of millions of years ago as organic-rich mud at the bottom of ancient seas and tidal flats. Over time the mud layers were buried by further sedimentation, and the resulting heat and pressure transformed the mud into shale and the organic matter into natural gas. Over long stretches of geologic time, gas that was generated in the shales migrated into more-permeable rock layers, forming today’s so-called conventional reservoirs—gas deposits that are easily tapped through conventional drilling. However, much gas is still contained in the shale “source rocks.” The problem for producers is that it diffuses at an extremely slow rate and must be extracted through unconventional means. The most productive method is usually horizontal drilling through the shale seam, followed by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, of the rock by the injecting of fluid at extremely high pressure.\n## Shale gas resources of the United States\nHorizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing of shale gas formations began to be applied to great effect in the United States during the 1990s. Since then these methods have radically changed the natural gas market in that country. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a statistical service of the U.S. Department of Energy, shale gas, which had accounted for a minuscule amount of U.S. natural gas production in 2000, climbed to almost one-quarter of the total by 2010. By 2035, the EIA predicted, shale gas will account for almost half of U.S. gas production.\nSuch figures have prompted the American natural gas industry to proclaim that the country has been swept by a “shale gale,” a wave of accessible cheap fuel that will help the United States to meet its energy needs through the 21st century without having to rely on foreign sources. In addition, natural gas is promoted as a “bridge fuel,” a clean-burning fossil fuel that will enable society to lower its emissions of greenhouse gases in the short term while proceeding with the development of renewable energies in the long term.\nSome of the most actively worked shale basins in the United States are located in southern regions that have long been oil and gas producers. These include the Barnett Shale, around Dallas–Fort Worth, Texas; the Fayetteville Shale, mainly in northern Arkansas; the Woodford Shale, mainly in Oklahoma; and the Haynesville Shale, straddling the Texas-Louisiana state line. The Barnett Shale was the proving ground of horizontal drilling and fracking starting in the 1990s; more than 10,000 wells have been drilled in that basin. Other shale basins are found in some Rocky Mountains and Great Plains states and in the Midwestern states of Illinois and Michigan, among others.\nThe largest basin in the United States is the Marcellus Shale, lying under most of Pennsylvania but also extending northeast into New York and southwest into Ohio and West Virginia. According to industry officials and geologists, the Marcellus has reserves so rich that it promises to turn Pennsylvania and its neighbouring states into the “Saudi Arabia of natural gas.” Estimates of recoverable reserves in the Marcellus vary from less than 3 trillion cubic metres (100 trillion cubic feet) to more than 14 trillion cubic metres (500 trillion cubic feet). However, even the lowest of these estimates is many times higher than the estimates current in the early 2000s, when shale gas developers, some with experience from mature shale gas basins in the South, began to acquire permits to drill there. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the number of new wells drilled into the Marcellus Shale in that state rose from 27 in 2007 to 1,445 in 2010.\n## Shale gas resources around the world\nMany natural gas industry officials and outside observers have suggested that shale gas might be a “game changer” in the global economy, altering the traditional division of the world between energy-rich supplier countries and energy-poor consumer countries. In an assessment of 14 shale gas-bearing regions outside the United States, the EIA has estimated that the shale gas resources of those regions (comprising 32 countries) plus the shale gas resources of the United States have increased the world’s technically recoverable gas resources by more than 40 percent. Many of these newly assessed resources are said to exist in countries that have not been major producers of conventional natural gas, raising the attractive possibility that some countries may be able to pursue economic growth while also reducing their dependence on foreign energy sources. For example, China’s technically recoverable shale gas resources were estimated in the EIA study to amount to some 36 trillion cubic metres (about 1,300 trillion cubic feet), half again as much as those of the United States. With a distribution infrastructure already in place for its traditional gas industry, China is capable of becoming a major shale gas producer.\n## Critics and skeptics\nNot everybody agrees that shale gas is a guarantor of economic prosperity or energy independence. Canadian geologist J. David Hughes of the Post Carbon Institute in Santa Rosa, California, argued that shale gas wells are notoriously short-lived, declining in gas production by as much as 85 percent in their first year—twice as fast as conventional wells. Because of the unyielding nature of the dense source rock, Hughes noted, shale gas wells routinely have to be refractured, and in the future shale deposits will have to be drilled and fractured in increasing numbers simply to maintain current production levels.\nOther geologists and business analysts have expressed uncertainty over the supposed vastness of recoverable shale gas resources. An example of this uncertainty can be seen in conflicting figures released by government services such as the EIA. According a report released by the EIA in 2011, improved drilling and fracturing technologies had doubled estimates of the United States’ unproven technically recoverable shale gas resources over previous estimates of resources. Of the approximately 72 trillion cubic metres (2,543 trillion cubic feet) of gas resources in the United States, shale gas was estimated to account for 23 trillion cubic metres (827 trillion cubic feet), more than 30 percent of the country’s domestic natural gas resource base. Yet in a report released the following year, the EIA lowered its estimate of unproven technically recoverable shale gas reserves by some 40 percent, to 13 trillion cubic metres (482 trillion cubic feet).\nGeologists tend to favour more modest resource estimates, frequently stressing the relative inaccessibility and density of the shale formations. Industry officials, on the other hand, tend to cite larger resource statistics, pointing out that improvements in technology make more gas reserves recoverable over time. Industry critics, meanwhile, note that shale developers have an interest in exaggerating reserve claims in order to increase the value of their companies in the eyes of investors. It has by no means been proved, critics insist, that shale companies actually can recover all the gas that they have claimed is recoverable or that shale deposits will provide a bridge fuel into the 22nd century.\nBoth Hughes and American biologist Robert Howarth of Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, dismiss claims that shale gas is “green.” They argue that, after accounting for all the energy consumed and all the pollutants emitted during all the steps from exploration to combustion, drilling and fracking actually produce a fuel that is no greener than coal or oil. Such arguments were well received in western Europe, where governments of various political stripes expressed commitment to the European Union’s goal of drastically reducing carbon emissions. France, for instance, has some of the largest shale gas resources in Europe—mainly in the picturesque southeast part of the country and in the densely populated north around Paris. Yet test drilling of those reserves provoked such a strong reaction by environmentalist groups that the government was prompted to put the issue to a vote in parliament. In June 2011 France became the first country in the world to ban the exploration and extraction of gas and oil by hydraulic fracturing.\nIn the United States, on the other hand, the safe exploitation of domestic reserves of shale gas has been seen as making a large contribution to a secure energy future. In response to concerns over the effects on the environment of drilling and fracturing for shale gas, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency embarked on a study of drinking-water resources, public health, and possible environmental impacts in the vicinity of seven specific shale gas production sites around the United States. A final report is to be submitted by 2014."], "selected_questions": ["What has led to the large scale production of shale gas since the 1990s?", "How are shale gas wells related to seismic events?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["", "Shale gas wells have been known to trigger seismic events, also known as induced seismicity.

These technologies have made it possible to extract natural gas from shale formations that were previously considered unprofitable or inaccessible.\n\nFracking involves injecting high-pressure fluids into shale formations to create fractures that release the trapped gas. Horizontal drilling allows for longer wellbores that can access more of the shale formation, increasing the amount of gas that can be extracted.\n\nThese technologies have led to a significant increase in shale gas production in the United States, which has become the world's largest producer of natural gas.

{"name": "Agnosticism", "documents": ["# Agnosticism\nAgnosticism is the view or belief that the existence of God, of the divine or the supernatural is unknown or unknowable. Another definition provided is the view that \"human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.\"\nThe English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the word agnostic in 1869, and said \"It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe.\" Earlier thinkers, however, had written works that promoted agnostic points of view, such as Sanjaya Belatthaputta, a 5th-century BCE Indian philosopher who expressed agnosticism about any afterlife; and Protagoras, a 5th-century BCE Greek philosopher who expressed agnosticism about the existence of \"the gods\".\n## Defining agnosticism\nAgnosticism is of the essence of science, whether ancient or modern. It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe. Consequently, agnosticism puts aside not only the greater part of popular theology, but also the greater part of anti-theology. On the whole, the \"bosh\" of heterodoxy is more offensive to me than that of orthodoxy, because heterodoxy professes to be guided by reason and science, and orthodoxy does not.— Thomas Henry Huxley\nThat which Agnostics deny and repudiate, as immoral, is the contrary doctrine, that there are propositions which men ought to believe, without logically satisfactory evidence; and that reprobation ought to attach to the profession of disbelief in such inadequately supported propositions.— Thomas Henry Huxley\nAgnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle ... Positively the principle may be expressed: In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration. And negatively: In matters of the intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable.— Thomas Henry Huxley\nBeing a scientist, above all else, Huxley presented agnosticism as a form of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting, objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.\nGeorge H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening the definition of atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view of those who do not hold a belief in the existence of any deity, but claim that the existence of a deity is unknown or inherently unknowable) and agnostic theism (the view of those who believe in the existence of a deity(s), but claim that the existence of a deity is unknown or inherently unknowable).\n### Etymology\nAgnostic (from Ancient Greek ἀ- (a-) 'without', and γνῶσις (gnōsis) 'knowledge') was used by Thomas Henry Huxley in a speech at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1869 to describe his philosophy, which rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge.\nEarly Christian church leaders used the Greek word gnosis (knowledge) to describe \"spiritual knowledge\". Agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the ancient religious movement of Gnosticism in particular; Huxley used the term in a broader, more abstract sense. Huxley identified agnosticism not as a creed but rather as a method of skeptical, evidence-based inquiry.\nThe term Agnostic is also cognate with the Sanskrit word Ajñasi which translates literally to \"not knowable\", and relates to the ancient Indian philosophical school of Ajñana, which proposes that it is impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it is useless and disadvantageous for final salvation.\nIn recent years, scientific literature dealing with neuroscience and psychology has used the word to mean \"not knowable\". In technical and marketing literature, \"agnostic\" can also mean independence from some parameters—for example, \"platform agnostic\" (referring to cross-platform software) or \"hardware-agnostic\".\n### Qualifying agnosticism\nScottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt. He asserted that the fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where a statement is true by definition (e.g. tautologies such as \"all bachelors are unmarried\" or \"all triangles have three corners\").\n## History\n### Hindu philosophy\nThroughout the history of Hinduism there has been a strong tradition of philosophic speculation and skepticism.\nThe Rig Veda takes an agnostic view on the fundamental question of how the universe and the gods were created. Nasadiya Sukta (Creation Hymn) in the tenth chapter of the Rig Veda says:\nBut, after all, who knows, and who can say Whence it all came, and how creation happened? The gods themselves are later than creation, so who knows truly whence it has arisen? Whence all creation had its origin, He, whether he fashioned it or whether he did not, He, who surveys it all from highest heaven, He knows – or maybe even he does not know.\n### Hume, Kant, and Kierkegaard\nAristotle, Anselm, Aquinas, Descartes, and Gödel presented arguments attempting to rationally prove the existence of God. The skeptical empiricism of David Hume, the antinomies of Immanuel Kant, and the existential philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard convinced many later philosophers to abandon these attempts, regarding it impossible to construct any unassailable proof for the existence or non-existence of God.\nIn his 1844 book, Philosophical Fragments, Kierkegaard writes:\nLet us call this unknown something: God. It is nothing more than a name we assign to it. The idea of demonstrating that this unknown something (God) exists, could scarcely suggest itself to Reason. For if God does not exist it would of course be impossible to prove it; and if he does exist it would be folly to attempt it. For at the very outset, in beginning my proof, I would have presupposed it, not as doubtful but as certain (a presupposition is never doubtful, for the very reason that it is a presupposition), since otherwise I would not begin, readily understanding that the whole would be impossible if he did not exist. But if when I speak of proving God's existence I mean that I propose to prove that the Unknown, which exists, is God, then I express myself unfortunately. For in that case I do not prove anything, least of all an existence, but merely develop the content of a conception.\nHume was Huxley's favourite philosopher, calling him \"the Prince of Agnostics\". Diderot wrote to his mistress, telling of a visit by Hume to the Baron D'Holbach, and describing how a word for the position that Huxley would later describe as agnosticism did not seem to exist, or at least was not common knowledge, at the time.\nThe first time that M. Hume found himself at the table of the Baron, he was seated beside him. I don't know for what purpose the English philosopher took it into his head to remark to the Baron that he did not believe in atheists, that he had never seen any. The Baron said to him: \"Count how many we are here.\" We are eighteen. The Baron added: \"It isn't too bad a showing to be able to point out to you fifteen at once: the three others haven't made up their minds.\"— Denis Diderot\n### United Kingdom\n#### Charles Darwin\nRaised in a religious environment, Charles Darwin (1809–1882) studied to be an Anglican clergyman. While eventually doubting parts of his faith, Darwin continued to help in church affairs, even while avoiding church attendance. Darwin stated that it would be \"absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist\". Although reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he wrote that \"I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God. – I think that generally ... an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind.\"\n#### Thomas Henry Huxley\nAgnostic views are as old as philosophical skepticism, but the terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by Huxley (1825–1895) to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics about the \"unconditioned\" (William Hamilton) and the \"unknowable\" (Herbert Spencer). Though Huxley began to use the term \"agnostic\" in 1869, his opinions had taken shape some time before that date. In a letter of September 23, 1860, to Charles Kingsley, Huxley discussed his views extensively:\nI neither affirm nor deny the immortality of man. I see no reason for believing it, but, on the other hand, I have no means of disproving it. I have no a priori objections to the doctrine. No man who has to deal daily and hourly with nature can trouble himself about a priori difficulties. Give me such evidence as would justify me in believing in anything else, and I will believe that. Why should I not? It is not half so wonderful as the conservation of force or the indestructibility of matter ... It is no use to talk to me of analogies and probabilities. I know what I mean when I say I believe in the law of the inverse squares, and I will not rest my life and my hopes upon weaker convictions ... That my personality is the surest thing I know may be true. But the attempt to conceive what it is leads me into mere verbal subtleties. I have champed up all that chaff about the ego and the non-ego, noumena and phenomena, and all the rest of it, too often not to know that in attempting even to think of these questions, the human intellect flounders at once out of its depth.\nAnd again, to the same correspondent, May 6, 1863:\nI have never had the least sympathy with the a priori reasons against orthodoxy, and I have by nature and disposition the greatest possible antipathy to all the atheistic and infidel school. Nevertheless I know that I am, in spite of myself, exactly what the Christian would call, and, so far as I can see, is justified in calling, atheist and infidel. I cannot see one shadow or tittle of evidence that the great unknown underlying the phenomenon of the universe stands to us in the relation of a Father  loves us and cares for us as Christianity asserts. So with regard to the other great Christian dogmas, immortality of soul and future state of rewards and punishments, what possible objection can I—who am compelled perforce to believe in the immortality of what we call Matter and Force, and in a very unmistakable present state of rewards and punishments for our deeds—have to these doctrines? Give me a scintilla of evidence, and I am ready to jump at them.\nOf the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude, Huxley gave the following account:\nWhen I reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether I was an atheist, a theist, or a pantheist; a materialist or an idealist; Christian or a freethinker; I found that the more I learned and reflected, the less ready was the answer; until, at last, I came to the conclusion that I had neither art nor part with any of these denominations, except the last. The one thing in which most of these good people were agreed was the one thing in which I differed from them. They were quite sure they had attained a certain \"gnosis\"—had, more or less successfully, solved the problem of existence; while I was quite sure I had not, and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was insoluble. And, with Hume and Kant on my side, I could not think myself presumptuous in holding fast by that opinion ... So I took thought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of \"agnostic\". It came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the \"gnostic\" of Church history, who professed to know so much about the very things of which I was ignorant. ... To my great satisfaction the term took.\nIn 1889, Huxley wrote:\nTherefore, although it be, as I believe, demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of the authorship, or of the date of composition of the Gospels, as they have come down to us, and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject.\n#### William Stewart Ross\nWilliam Stewart Ross (1844–1906) wrote under the name of Saladin. He was associated with Victorian Freethinkers and the organization the British Secular Union. He edited the Secular Review from 1882; it was renamed Agnostic Journal and Eclectic Review and closed in 1907. Ross championed agnosticism in opposition to the atheism of Charles Bradlaugh as an open-ended spiritual exploration.\nIn Why I am an Agnostic (c. 1889) he claims that agnosticism is \"the very reverse of atheism\".\n#### Bertrand Russell\nBertrand Russell (1872–1970) declared Why I Am Not a Christian in 1927, a classic statement of agnosticism. He calls upon his readers to \"stand on their own two feet and look fair and square at the world with a fearless attitude and a free intelligence\".\nIn 1939, Russell gave a lecture on The existence and nature of God, in which he characterized himself as an atheist. He said:\nThe existence and nature of God is a subject of which I can discuss only half. If one arrives at a negative conclusion concerning the first part of the question, the second part of the question does not arise; and my position, as you may have gathered, is a negative one on this matter.\nHowever, later in the same lecture, discussing modern non-anthropomorphic concepts of God, Russell states:\nThat sort of God is, I think, not one that can actually be disproved, as I think the omnipotent and benevolent creator can.\nIn Russell's 1947 pamphlet, Am I An Atheist or an Agnostic? (subtitled A Plea For Tolerance in the Face of New Dogmas), he ruminates on the problem of what to call himself:\nAs a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one can prove that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.\nIn his 1953 essay, What Is An Agnostic? Russell states:\nAn agnostic thinks it impossible to know the truth in matters such as God and the future life with which Christianity and other religions are concerned. Or, if not impossible, at least impossible at the present time. Are Agnostics Atheists? No. An atheist, like a Christian, holds that we can know whether or not there is a God. The Christian holds that we can know there is a God; the atheist, that we can know there is not. The Agnostic suspends judgment, saying that there are not sufficient grounds either for affirmation or for denial.\nLater in the essay, Russell adds:\nI think that if I heard a voice from the sky predicting all that was going to happen to me during the next twenty-four hours, including events that would have seemed highly improbable, and if all these events then produced to happen, I might perhaps be convinced at least of the existence of some superhuman intelligence.\n#### Leslie Weatherhead\nIn 1965, Christian theologian Leslie Weatherhead (1893–1976) published The Christian Agnostic, in which he argues:\n... many professing agnostics are nearer belief in the true God than are many conventional church-goers who believe in a body that does not exist whom they miscall God.\nAlthough radical and unpalatable to conventional theologians, Weatherhead's agnosticism falls far short of Huxley's, and short even of weak agnosticism:\nOf course, the human soul will always have the power to reject God, for choice is essential to its nature, but I cannot believe that anyone will finally do this.\n### United States\n#### Robert G. Ingersoll\nRobert G. Ingersoll (1833–1899), an Illinois lawyer and politician who evolved into a well-known and sought-after orator in 19th-century America, has been referred to as the \"Great Agnostic\".\nIn an 1896 lecture titled Why I Am An Agnostic, Ingersoll related why he was an agnostic:\nIs there a supernatural power—an arbitrary mind—an enthroned God—a supreme will that sways the tides and currents of the world—to which all causes bow? I do not deny. I do not know—but I do not believe. I believe that the natural is supreme—that from the infinite chain no link can be lost or broken—that there is no supernatural power that can answer prayer—no power that worship can persuade or change—no power that cares for man. I believe that with infinite arms Nature embraces the all—that there is no interference—no chance—that behind every event are the necessary and countless causes, and that beyond every event will be and must be the necessary and countless effects. Is there a God? I do not know. Is man immortal? I do not know. One thing I do know, and that is, that neither hope, nor fear, belief, nor denial, can change the fact. It is as it is, and it will be as it must be.\nIn the conclusion of the speech he simply sums up the agnostic position as:\nWe can be as honest as we are ignorant. If we are, when asked what is beyond the horizon of the known, we must say that we do not know.\nIn 1885, Ingersoll explained his comparative view of agnosticism and atheism as follows:\nThe Agnostic is an Atheist. The Atheist is an Agnostic. The Agnostic says, 'I do not know, but I do not believe there is any God.' The Atheist says the same.\n#### Bernard Iddings Bell\nCanon Bernard Iddings Bell (1886–1958), a popular cultural commentator, Episcopal priest, and author, lauded the necessity of agnosticism in Beyond Agnosticism: A Book for Tired Mechanists, calling it the foundation of \"all intelligent Christianity\". Agnosticism was a temporary mindset in which one rigorously questioned the truths of the age, including the way in which one believed God. His view of Robert Ingersoll and Thomas Paine was that they were not denouncing true Christianity but rather \"a gross perversion of it\". Part of the misunderstanding stemmed from ignorance of the concepts of God and religion. Historically, a god was any real, perceivable force that ruled the lives of humans and inspired admiration, love, fear, and homage; religion was the practice of it. Ancient peoples worshiped gods with real counterparts, such as Mammon (money and material things), Nabu (rationality), or Ba'al (violent weather); Bell argued that modern peoples were still paying homage—with their lives and their children's lives—to these old gods of wealth, physical appetites, and self-deification. Thus, if one attempted to be agnostic passively, he or she would incidentally join the worship of the world's gods.\nIn Unfashionable Convictions (1931), he criticized the Enlightenment's complete faith in human sensory perception, augmented by scientific instruments, as a means of accurately grasping Reality. Firstly, it was fairly new, an innovation of the Western World, which Aristotle invented and Thomas Aquinas revived among the scientific community. Secondly, the divorce of \"pure\" science from human experience, as manifested in American Industrialization, had completely altered the environment, often disfiguring it, so as to suggest its insufficiency to human needs. Thirdly, because scientists were constantly producing more data—to the point where no single human could grasp it all at once—it followed that human intelligence was incapable of attaining a complete understanding of universe; therefore, to admit the mysteries of the unobserved universe was to be actually scientific.\nBell believed that there were two other ways that humans could perceive and interact with the world. Artistic experience was how one expressed meaning through speaking, writing, painting, gesturing—any sort of communication which shared insight into a human's inner reality. Mystical experience was how one could \"read\" people and harmonize with them, being what we commonly call love. In summary, man was a scientist, artist, and lover. Without exercising all three, a person became \"lopsided\".\nBell considered a humanist to be a person who cannot rightly ignore the other ways of knowing. However, humanism, like agnosticism, was also temporal, and would eventually lead to either scientific materialism or theism. He lays out the following thesis:\nTruth cannot be discovered by reasoning on the evidence of scientific data alone. Modern peoples' dissatisfaction with life is the result of depending on such incomplete data. Our ability to reason is not a way to discover Truth but rather a way to organize our knowledge and experiences somewhat sensibly. Without a full, human perception of the world, one's reason tends to lead them in the wrong direction. Beyond what can be measured with scientific tools, there are other types of perception, such as one's ability know another human through loving. One's loves cannot be dissected and logged in a scientific journal, but we know them far better than we know the surface of the sun. They show us an undefinable reality that is nevertheless intimate and personal, and they reveal qualities lovelier and truer than detached facts can provide. To be religious, in the Christian sense, is to live for the Whole of Reality (God) rather than for a small part (gods). Only by treating this Whole of Reality as a person—good and true and perfect—rather than an impersonal force, can we come closer to the Truth. An ultimate Person can be loved, but a cosmic force cannot. A scientist can only discover peripheral truths, but a lover is able to get at the Truth. There are many reasons to believe in God but they are not sufficient for an agnostic to become a theist. It is not enough to believe in an ancient holy book, even though when it is accurately analyzed without bias, it proves to be more trustworthy and admirable than what we are taught in school. Neither is it enough to realize how probable it is that a personal God would have to show human beings how to live, considering they have so much trouble on their own. Nor is it enough to believe for the reason that, throughout history, millions of people have arrived at this Wholeness of Reality only through religious experience. The aforementioned reasons may warm one toward religion, but they fall short of convincing. However, if one presupposes that God is in fact a knowable, loving person, as an experiment, and then lives according that religion, he or she will suddenly come face to face with experiences previously unknown. One's life becomes full, meaningful, and fearless in the face of death. It does not defy reason but exceeds it. Because God has been experienced through love, the orders of prayer, fellowship, and devotion now matter. They create order within one's life, continually renewing the \"missing piece\" that had previously felt lost. They empower one to be compassionate and humble, not small-minded or arrogant. No truth should be denied outright, but all should be questioned. Science reveals an ever-growing vision of our universe that should not be discounted due to bias toward older understandings. Reason is to be trusted and cultivated. To believe in God is not to forego reason or to deny scientific facts, but to step into the unknown and discover the fullness of life.\n## Demographics\nDemographic research services normally do not differentiate between various types of non-religious respondents, so agnostics are often classified in the same category as atheists or other non-religious people.\nA 2010 survey published in Encyclopædia Britannica found that the non-religious people or the agnostics made up about 9.6% of the world's population. A November–December 2006 poll published in the Financial Times gives rates for the United States and five European countries. The rates of agnosticism in the United States were at 14%, while the rates of agnosticism in the European countries surveyed were considerably higher: Italy (20%), Spain (30%), Great Britain (35%), Germany (25%), and France (32%).\nA study conducted by the Pew Research Center found that about 16% of the world's people, the third largest group after Christianity and Islam, have no religious affiliation. According to a 2012 report by the Pew Research Center, agnostics made up 3.3% of the US adult population. In the U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center, 55% of agnostic respondents expressed \"a belief in God or a universal spirit\", whereas 41% stated that they thought that they felt a tension \"being non-religious in a society where most people are religious\".\nAccording to the 2011 Australian Bureau of Statistics, 22% of Australians have \"no religion\", a category that includes agnostics. Between 64% and 65% of Japanese and up to 81% of Vietnamese are atheists, agnostics, or do not believe in a god. An official European Union survey reported that 3% of the EU population is unsure about their belief in a god or spirit.\n## Criticism\nAgnosticism is criticized from a variety of standpoints. Some atheists criticize the use of the term agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label.\n### Theistic\nTheistic critics claim that agnosticism is impossible in practice, since a person can live only either as if God did not exist (etsi deus non-daretur), or as if God did exist (etsi deus daretur).\n#### Christian\nAccording to Pope Benedict XVI, strong agnosticism in particular contradicts itself in affirming the power of reason to know scientific truth. He blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters. \"Agnosticism\", said Benedict, \"is always the fruit of a refusal of that knowledge which is in fact offered to man ... The knowledge of God has always existed\". He asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort, pride, dominion, and utility over truth, and is opposed by the following attitudes: the keenest self-criticism, humble listening to the whole of existence, the persistent patience and self-correction of the scientific method, a readiness to be purified by the truth.\nThe Catholic Church sees merit in examining what it calls \"partial agnosticism\", specifically those systems that \"do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the unknowable, but at excluding special kinds of truth, notably religious, from the domain of knowledge\". However, the Church is historically opposed to a full denial of the capacity of human reason to know God. The Council of the Vatican declares, \"God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation\".\nBlaise Pascal argued that even if there were truly no evidence for God, agnostics should consider what is now known as Pascal's Wager: the infinite expected value of acknowledging God is always greater than the finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence, and thus it is a safer \"bet\" to choose God.\n### Atheistic\nAccording to Richard Dawkins, a distinction between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero a person is willing to rate the probability of existence for any given god-like entity. About himself, Dawkins continues, \"I am agnostic only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden.\" Dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics; \"Temporary Agnostics in Practice\" (TAPs), and \"Permanent Agnostics in Principle\" (PAPs). He states that \"agnosticism about the existence of God belongs firmly in the temporary or TAP category. Either he exists or he doesn't. It is a scientific question; one day we may know the answer, and meanwhile we can say something pretty strong about the probability\" and considers PAP a \"deeply inescapable kind of fence-sitting\".\n## Ignosticism\nA related concept is ignosticism, the view that a coherent definition of a deity must be put forward before the question of the existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed. If the chosen definition is not coherent, the ignostic holds the noncognitivist view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable. A. J. Ayer, Theodore Drange, and other philosophers see both atheism and agnosticism as incompatible with ignosticism on the grounds that atheism and agnosticism accept the statement \"a deity exists\" as a meaningful proposition that can be argued for or against.", "agnosticism, (from Greek agnōstos, “unknowable”), strictly speaking, the doctrine that humans cannot know of the existence of anything beyond the phenomena of their experience. The term has come to be equated in popular parlance with skepticism about religious questions in general and in particular with the rejection of traditional Christian beliefs under the impact of modern scientific thought. The word agnosticism was first publicly coined in 1869 at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in London by T.H. Huxley, a British biologist and champion of the Darwinian theory of evolution. He coined it as a suitable label for his own position. “It came into my head as suggestively antithetical to the ‘Gnostic’ of Church history who professed to know so much about the very things of which I was ignorant.”\n## Nature and kinds of agnosticism\nGeorge BerkeleyHuxley’s statement brings out both the fact that agnosticism has something to do with not knowing, and that this not knowing refers particularly to the sphere of religious doctrine. Etymology, however, and now common usage, do permit less limited uses of the term. The Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin, for instance, in his Materialism and Empirio-Criticism (1908), distinguished the extremes of true materialism on the one hand and the bold idealism of George Berkeley, an 18th-century idealist, on the other. He recognized as attempted halfway houses between them the “agnosticisms” of the Scottish skeptic David Hume and the great German critical philosopher Immanuel Kant—agnosticisms that here consisted in their contentions about the unknowability of the nature, or even the existence, of “things-in-themselves” (realities beyond appearances).\n## Huxley’s nonreligious agnosticism\nThe essence of Huxley’s agnosticism—and his statement, as the inventor of the term, must be peculiarly authoritative—was not a profession of total ignorance, nor even of total ignorance within one special but very large sphere. Rather, he insisted, it was “not a creed but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle,” namely, to follow reason “as far as it can take you,” but then, when you have established as much as you can, frankly and honestly to recognize the limits of your knowledge. It is the same principle as that later proclaimed in an essay on “The Ethics of Belief” (1876) by the British mathematician and philosopher of science W.K. Clifford: “It is wrong always, everywhere and for everyone to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.” Applied by Huxley to fundamental Christian claims, this principle yields characteristically skeptical conclusions: speaking, for example, of the apocrypha (ancient scriptural writings excluded from the biblical canon), he wrote: “One may suspect that a little more critical discrimination would have enlarged the Apocrypha not inconsiderably.” In the same spirit, Sir Leslie Stephen, 19th-century literary critic and historian of thought, in An Agnostic’s Apology, and Other Essays (1893), reproached those who pretended to delineate “the nature of God Almighty with an accuracy from which modest naturalists would shrink in describing the genesis of a black beetle.”\nAgnosticism in its primary reference is commonly contrasted with atheism thus: “The Atheist asserts that there is no God, whereas the Agnostic maintains only that he does not know.” This distinction, however, is in two respects misleading: first, Huxley himself certainly rejected as outright false—rather than as not known to be true or false—many widely popular views about God, his providence, and man’s posthumous destiny; and second, if this were the crucial distinction, agnosticism would for almost all practical purposes be the same as atheism. It was indeed on this misunderstanding that Huxley and his associates were attacked both by enthusiastic Christian polemicists and by Friedrich Engels, the co-worker of Karl Marx, as “shame-faced atheists,” a description that is perfectly applicable to many of those who nowadays adopt the more comfortable label.\nAgnosticism, moreover, is not the same as skepticism, which, in the comprehensive and classical form epitomized by the ancient Greek skeptic Sextus Empiricus (2nd and 3rd centuries ce), confidently challenges not merely religious or metaphysical knowledge but all knowledge claims that venture beyond immediate experience. Agnosticism is, as skepticism surely could not be, compatible with the approach of positivism, which emphasizes the achievements and possibilities of natural and social science—though most agnostics, including Huxley, have nonetheless harboured reserves about the more authoritarian and eccentric features of the system of Auguste Comte, the 19th-century founder of positivism.\n## Religious agnosticism\nIt is also possible to speak of a religious agnosticism. But if this expression is not to be contradictory, it has to be taken to refer to an acceptance of the agnostic principle, combined either with a conviction that at least some minimum of affirmative doctrine can be established on adequate grounds, or else with the sort of religion or religiousness that makes no very substantial or disputatious doctrinal demands. If these two varieties of agnosticism be admitted, then Huxley’s original agnosticism may be marked off from the latter as (not religious but) secular and from the former as (not religious but) atheist—construing “atheist” here as a word as wholly negative and neutral as “atypical” or “asymmetrical.” These, without pejorative insinuations, mean merely “not typical” or “not symmetrical” (the atheist is thus one who is simply without a belief in God).\nHuxley himself allowed for the possibility of an agnosticism that was in these senses religious—even Christian—as opposed to atheist. Thus, in another 1889 essay “Agnosticism and Christianity,” he contrasted “scientific theology,” with which “agnosticism has no quarrel,” with “Ecclesiasticism, or, as our neighbours across the Channel call it, Clericalism,” and his complaint against the latter’s proponents was not that they reach substantive conclusions different from his own but that they maintain “that it is morally wrong not to believe certain propositions, whatever the results of strict scientific investigation of the evidence of these propositions.” The second possibility, that of an agnosticism that is religious as opposed to secular, was realized perhaps most strikingly in the Buddha. Typically and traditionally, the ecclesiastical Christian has insisted that absolute certainty about some minimum approved list of propositions concerning God and the general divine scheme of things was wholly necessary to salvation. Equally typically, according to the tradition, the Buddha sidestepped all such speculative questions. At best they could only distract attention from the urgent business of salvation—salvation, of course, in his own very different interpretation.\n## Huxley’s nonreligious agnosticism\nThe essence of Huxley’s agnosticism—and his statement, as the inventor of the term, must be peculiarly authoritative—was not a profession of total ignorance, nor even of total ignorance within one special but very large sphere.

{"name": "Greek Anthology", "documents": ["# Greek Anthology\nThe Greek Anthology (Latin: Anthologia Graeca) is a collection of poems, mostly epigrams, that span the Classical and Byzantine periods of Greek literature. Most of the material of the Greek Anthology comes from two manuscripts, the Palatine Anthology of the 10th century and the Anthology of Planudes (or Planudean Anthology) of the 14th century.\nThe earliest known anthology in Greek was compiled by Meleager of Gadara in the first century BC, under the title Anthologia, or \"Flower-gathering.\" It contained poems by the compiler himself and forty-six other poets, including Archilochus, Alcaeus, Anacreon, and Simonides. In his preface to his collection, Meleager describes his arrangement of poems as if it were a head-band or garland of flowers woven together in a tour de force that made the word \"Anthology\" a synonym for a collection of literary works for future generations.\nMeleager's Anthology was popular enough that it attracted later additions. Prefaces to the editions of Philippus of Thessalonica and Agathias were preserved in the Greek Anthology to attest to their additions of later poems. The definitive edition was made by Constantine Cephalas in the 10th century, who added a number of other collections: homoerotic verse collected by Straton of Sardis in the 2nd century AD; a collection of Christian epigrams found in churches; a collection of satirical and convivial epigrams collected by Diogenianus; Christodorus' description of statues in the Byzantine gymnasium of Zeuxippos; and a collection of inscriptions from a temple in Cyzicus.\nThe scholar Maximus Planudes also made an edition of the Greek Anthology, which while adding some poems, primarily deleted or bowdlerized many of the poems he felt were too explicit. His anthology was the only one known to Western Europe (his autograph copy, dated 1301 survives; the first edition based on his collection was printed in 1494) until 1606 when Claudius Salmasius found in the library at Heidelberg a fuller collection based on Cephalas. The copy made by Salmasius was not, however, published until 1776, when Richard François Philippe Brunck included it in his Analecta. The first critical edition was that of F. Jacobs (13 vols. 1794–1803; revised 1813–17).\nSince its transmission to the rest of Europe, the Greek Anthology has left a deep impression on its readers. In a 1971 article on Robin Skelton's translation of a selection of poems from the Anthology, a reviewer for the Times Literary Supplement wrote, \"The time of life does not exist when it is impossible to discover in it a masterly poem one had never seen before.\" Its influence can be seen on writers as diverse as Propertius, Ezra Pound and Edgar Lee Masters. Since full and uncensored English translations became available at the end of the 20th century, its influence has widened still further.\n## Literary history\nThe art of occasional poetry had been cultivated in Greece from an early period, being used to commemorate remarkable individuals or events, on funerary monuments and votive offerings. These compositions were termed epigrams, i.e. inscribed poems. Such a composition must necessarily be brief, and as a result, conciseness of expression, pregnancy of meaning, purity of diction and singleness of thought are the indispensable conditions of excellence in the epigrammatic style. The term was soon extended to any piece by which these conditions were fulfilled.\nAbout 60 BC, the sophist and poet Meleager of Gadara undertook to combine the choicest effusions of his predecessors into a single body of fugitive poetry. Collections of monumental inscriptions, or of poems on particular subjects, had previously been formed by Polemon Periegetes and others; but Meleager first gave the principle a comprehensive application. His selection, compiled from forty-six of his predecessors, and including numerous contributions of his own, was entitled The Garland (Στέφανος); in an introductory poem each poet is compared to some flower, fancifully deemed appropriate to his genius. The arrangement of his collection was alphabetical, according to the initial letter of each epigram.\nIn the age of the emperor Tiberius (or Trajan, according to others) the work of Meleager was continued by another epigrammatist, Philippus of Thessalonica, who first employed the term \"anthology\". His collection, which included the compositions of thirteen writers subsequent to Meleager, was also arranged alphabetically, and contained an introductory poem. It was of inferior quality to Meleager's. Somewhat later, under Hadrian, another supplement was formed by the sophist Diogenianus of Heracleia (2nd century AD), and Straton of Sardis compiled his elegant Μοῦσα παιδική (Musa Puerilis) from his productions and those of earlier writers. No further collection from various sources is recorded until the time of Justinian, when epigrammatic writing, especially of an amatory character, experienced a great revival at the hands of Agathias of Myrina, the historian, Paulus Silentiarius, and their circle. Their ingenious but mannered productions were collected by Agathias into a new anthology, entitled The Circle (Κύκλος); it was the first to be divided into books, and arranged with reference to the subjects of the pieces.\nThese and other collections made during the Middle Ages are now lost. The partial incorporation of them into a single body, classified according to the contents in 15 books, was the work of a certain Constantinus Cephalas, whose name alone is preserved in the single MS. of his compilation extant, but who probably lived during the literary revival under Constantine Porphyrogenitus, at the beginning of the 10th century. He appears to have merely made excerpts from the existing anthologies, with the addition of selections from Lucillius, Palladas, and other epigrammatists, whose compositions had been published separately. His arrangement is founded on a principle of classification, and nearly corresponds to that adopted by Agathias. His principle of selection is unknown. The next editor was the monk Maximus Planudes (AD 1320), who removed some epigrams from Cephalas' anthology, added some verses of his own, and preserved epigrams on works of art, which are not included in the only surviving transcript of Cephalas.\nThe Planudean Anthology (in seven books) was the only recension of the anthology known at the revival of classical literature, and was first published at Florence, by Janus Lascaris, in 1494. It long continued to be the only accessible collection, for although the Palatine manuscript known as the Palatine Anthology, the sole extant copy of the anthology of Cephalas, was discovered in the Palatine library at Heidelberg, and copied by Saumaise (Salmasius) in 1606, it was not published until 1776, when it was included in Brunck's Analecta Veterum Poetarum Graecorum (Crumbs of the Ancient Greek Poets). The manuscript itself had frequently changed its quarters. In 1623, having been taken in the sack of Heidelberg in the Thirty Years' War, it was sent with the rest of the Palatine Library to Rome as a present from Maximilian I of Bavaria to Pope Gregory XV, who had it divided into two parts, the first of which was by far the larger; thence it was taken to Paris in 1797. In 1816 it went back to Heidelberg, but in an incomplete state, the second part remaining at Paris. It is now represented at Heidelberg by a photographic facsimile.\nBrunck's edition was superseded by the standard one of Friedrich Jacobs (1794–1814, 13 vols.), the text of which was reprinted in a more convenient form in 1813–1817, and occupies three pocket volumes in the Tauchnitz series of the classics. The best edition for general purposes is perhaps that of Dubner in Didot's Bibliotheca (1864–1872), which contains the Palatine Anthology, the epigrams of the Planudean Anthology not collected in the former, an appendix of pieces derived from other sources, copious notes, a literal Latin prose translation by Jean François Boissonade, Bothe, and Lapaume and the metrical Latin versions of Hugo Grotius. A third volume, edited by E. Cougny, was published in 1890. The best edition of the Planudean Anthology is the splendid one by van Bosch and van Lennep  (1795–1822). There is also an incomplete edition of the text by Hugo Stadtmüller in the Teubner series, 3 vols., which stops at IX 563 due to Stadtmüller's death. More recent editions are one in the Collection des Universités de France series, 13 vols., started by Pierre Waltz and continued by other scholars, and one edited by Hermann Beckby, 4 vols., in the Tusculum series. The most recent edition is by Fabrizio Conca, Mario Marzi and Giuseppe Zanetto, 3 vols., published by UTET.\n## Arrangement\nThe Palatine MS., the archetype of the present text, was transcribed by different persons at different times, and the actual arrangement of the collection does not correspond with that signalized in the index. It is as follows: Book 1. Christian epigrams; 2. Christodorus's description of certain statues; 3. Inscriptions in the temple at Cyzicus; 4. The prefaces of Meleager, Philippus, and Agathias to their respective collections; 5. Amatory epigrams; 6. Votive inscriptions; 7. Epitaphs; 8. The epigrams of Gregory of Nazianzus; 9. Rhetorical and illustrative epigrams; 10. Ethical pieces; 11. Humorous and convivial; 12. Strato's Musa Puerilis; 13. Metrical curiosities; 14. Puzzles, enigmas, oracles; 15. Miscellanies. The epigrams on works of art, as already stated, are missing from the Codex Palatinus, and must be sought in an appendix of epigrams only occurring in the Planudean Anthology. The epigrams hitherto recovered from ancient monuments and similar sources form appendices in the second and third volumes of Dübner's edition. The Liddell Scott Greek Lexicon divides the Anthologia Graeca sources into Anthologia Palatina, Planudea (1864-1968), then Appendix nova epigrammatum (1890 onward).\n## Style\nThe poems in the anthology represent different periods. Four stages may be indicated:\nThe Hellenic proper, of which Simonides of Ceos (c. 556 – 469 BC), the author of most of the sepulchral inscriptions on those who fell in the Persian wars, is representative. Nearly all the pieces of this era are actual inscriptions or addresses to real personages, whether living or deceased. The epigram received a great development in its second or Alexandrian era, when its range was extended to include anecdote, satire, and amorous longing; when epitaphs and votive inscriptions were composed on imaginary persons and things. The modification has a representative in Leonidas of Tarentum, a contemporary of Pyrrhus of Epirus, and closes with Antipater of Sidon, about 140 BC (or later). Callimachus, one of the Alexandrian poets, affects stern simplicity in his epigrams. Meleager of Gadara was a Syrian; his pieces are usually erotic, with far-fetched conceits. His gaiety and licentiousness are imitated and exaggerated by his somewhat later contemporary, the Epicurean Philodemus, and his fancy reappears in Philodemus's contemporary, Zonas, in Crinagoras of Mytilene, who wrote under Augustus, and in Marcus Argentarius, of uncertain date. At a later period of the empire another genre, was developed, the satirical. Lucillus of Tarrha, who flourished under Nero, and Lucian, display a talent for shrewd, caustic epigram. The same style obtains with Palladas, an Alexandrian grammarian of the 4th century, the last of the strictly classical epigrammatists. His literary position is that of an indignant but despairing opponent of Christianity. The fourth or Byzantine style of epigrammatic composition was cultivated at the court of Justinian. The diction of Agathias and his compeers is ornate.\n## Translations and imitations\nLatin renderings of select epigrams by Hugo Grotius were published in Bosch and Lennep's edition of the Planudean Anthology, in the Didot edition, and in Henry Wellesley's Anthologia Polyglotta. Imitations in modern languages have been copious, actual translations less common. F. D. Dehèque's 1863 translation was in French prose. The German language admits of the preservation of the original metre, a circumstance exploited by Johann Gottfried Herder and Christian Friedrich Wilhelm Jacobs.\nRobert Bland, John Herman Merivale, and their associates (1806–1813), produced efforts that are often diffuse. Francis Wrangham's (1769–1842) versions, Poems (London, 1795), are more spirited; and John Sterling translated the inscriptions of Simonides. John Wilson in Blackwood's Magazine 1833–1835, collected and commented on the labours of these and other translators, including indifferent attempts of William Hay.\nIn 1849 Henry Wellesley, principal of New Inn Hall, Oxford, published his Anthologia Polyglotta, a collection of the translations and imitations in all languages, with the original text. In this appeared versions by Goldwin Smith and Merivale, which, with the other English renderings extant at the time, accompany the literal prose translation of the Public School Selections, executed by the Rev. George Burges for Bohn's Classical Library (1854).\nIn 1864 Major R. G. Macgregor published Greek Anthology, with notes critical and explanatory, an almost complete but mediocre translation of the Anthology. Idylls and Epigrams, by Richard Garnett (1869, reprinted 1892 in the Cameo series), includes about 140 translations or imitations, with some original compositions in the same style.\nFurther translations and selections include:\nRobert Bland, John Herman Merivale, Translations chiefly from the Greek Anthology (London, 1806) ——— Collections from the Greek Anthology, &c.

James Davies's essay on Epigrams in the Quarterly Review (vol. cxvii.), illustrating the distinction between Greek and Latin epigram; and the disquisition in J. A. Symonds's Studies of the Greek Poets (1873; 3rd ed., 1893).", "Greek Anthology, Greek Anthologia Hellēnikē, collection of about 3,700 Greek epigrams, songs, epitaphs, and rhetorical exercises, mostly in elegiac couplets, that can be dated from as early as the 7th century bce to as late as 1000 ce. The nucleus of the Anthology is a collection made early in the 1st century bce by Meleager, who called it Stephanos (Greek: “Crown,” or “Collection of Flowers”); he introduced it with a poem comparing each writer in the collection to a flower. In the late 9th century ce, Constantinus Cephalas joined Meleager’s collection to those of Philippus of Thessalonica (1st century ce), Diogenianus (2nd century ce), Agathias (6th century ce), and others. In the 10th century the Cephalas collection was revised and augmented. This revision forms the first 15 books of the Anthology, preserved in the Palatine Anthology, a manuscript discovered at Heidelberg, Germany. The 16th book is made up of poems culled from another, shorter manuscript version of Cephalas’s collection (the Planudean manuscript, or Planudean Anthology) and compiled by Maximus Planudes in 1301. Modern scholarship has attempted to detail the relationships between the Palatine and Planudean anthologies and surviving manuscripts that include the same and similar—and, in some cases, unique—content. Because of a lack of conclusive evidence, however, scholars have drawn differing conclusions about these relationships.\nThe literary value of the Anthology lies in the distinction and charm of perhaps one-sixth of the whole. For the rest, it preserves a good deal that is of historical interest; it illustrates the continuity of Greek literature for almost 2,000 years, because the latest inclusions in it are, in language, style, and feeling, not too different from the earliest inclusions.

{"name": "Conscience", "documents": ["conscience, a personal sense of the moral content of one’s own conduct, intentions, or character with regard to a feeling of obligation to do right or be good. Conscience, usually informed by acculturation and instruction, is thus generally understood to give intuitively authoritative judgments regarding the moral quality of single actions.\nHistorically, almost every culture has recognized the existence of such a faculty. Ancient Egyptians, for example, were urged not to transgress against the dictates of the heart, for one “must stand in fear of departing from its guidance.” In some belief systems, conscience is regarded as the voice of God and therefore a completely reliable guide of conduct: among the Hindus it is considered “the invisible God who dwells within us.” Among Western religious groups, the Society of Friends (or Quakers) places particular emphasis on the role of conscience in apprehending and responding through conduct to the “Inner Light” of God.\nOutside the context of religion, philosophers, social scientists, and psychologists have sought to understand conscience in both its individual and universal aspects. The view that holds conscience to be an innate, intuitive faculty determining the perception of right and wrong is called intuitionism. The view that holds conscience to be a cumulative and subjective inference from past experience giving direction to future conduct is called empiricism. The behavioral scientist, on the other hand, may view the conscience as a set of learned responses to particular social stimuli. Another explanation of conscience was put forth in the 20th century by Sigmund Freud in his postulation of the superego. According to Freud, the superego is a major element of personality that is formed by the child’s incorporation of moral values through parental approval or punishment. The resulting internalized set of prohibitions, condemnations, and inhibitions is that part of the superego known as conscience.", "# Conscience\nConscience is a cognitive process that elicits emotion and rational associations based on an individual's moral philosophy or value system. Conscience stands in contrast to elicited emotion or thought due to associations based on immediate sensory perceptions and reflexive responses, as in sympathetic central nervous system responses. In common terms, conscience is often described as leading to feelings of remorse when a person commits an act that conflicts with their moral values. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based on reason has occasioned debate through much of modern history between theories of basics in ethic of human life in juxtaposition to the theories of romanticism and other reactionary movements after the end of the Middle Ages.\nReligious views of conscience usually see it as linked to a morality inherent in all humans, to a beneficent universe and/or to divinity. The diverse ritualistic, mythical, doctrinal, legal, institutional and material features of religion may not necessarily cohere with experiential, emotive, spiritual or contemplative considerations about the origin and operation of conscience. Common secular or scientific views regard the capacity for conscience as probably genetically determined, with its subject probably learned or imprinted as part of a culture.\nCommonly used metaphors for conscience include the \"voice within\", the \"inner light\", or even Socrates' reliance on what the Greeks called his \"daimōnic sign\", an averting (ἀποτρεπτικός apotreptikos) inner voice heard only when he was about to make a mistake. Conscience, as is detailed in sections below, is a concept in national and international law, is increasingly conceived of as applying to the world as a whole, has motivated numerous notable acts for the public good and been the subject of many prominent examples of literature, music and film.\n## Views\nAlthough humanity has no generally accepted definition of conscience or universal agreement about its role in ethical decision-making, three approaches have addressed it:\nReligious views Secular views Philosophical views\n### Religious\nIn the literary traditions of the Upanishads, Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita, conscience is the label given to attributes composing knowledge about good and evil, that a soul acquires from the completion of acts and consequent accretion of karma over many lifetimes. According to Adi Shankara in his Vivekachudamani morally right action (characterised as humbly and compassionately performing the primary duty of good to others without expectation of material or spiritual reward), helps \"purify the heart\" and provide mental tranquility but it alone does not give us \"direct perception of the Reality\". This knowledge requires discrimination between the eternal and non-eternal and eventually a realization in contemplation that the true self merges in a universe of pure consciousness.\nIn the Zoroastrian faith, after death a soul must face judgment at the Bridge of the Separator; there, evil people are tormented by prior denial of their own higher nature, or conscience, and \"to all time will they be guests for the House of the Lie.\" The Chinese concept of Ren, indicates that conscience, along with social etiquette and correct relationships, assist humans to follow The Way (Tao) a mode of life reflecting the implicit human capacity for goodness and harmony.\nConscience also features prominently in Buddhism. In the Pali scriptures, for example, Buddha links the positive aspect of conscience to a pure heart and a calm, well-directed mind. It is regarded as a spiritual power, and one of the \"Guardians of the World\". The Buddha also associated conscience with compassion for those who must endure cravings and suffering in the world until right conduct culminates in right mindfulness and right contemplation. Santideva (685–763 CE) wrote in the Bodhicaryavatara (which he composed and delivered in the great northern Indian Buddhist university of Nalanda) of the spiritual importance of perfecting virtues such as generosity, forbearance and training the awareness to be like a \"block of wood\" when attracted by vices such as pride or lust; so one can continue advancing towards right understanding in meditative absorption. Conscience thus manifests in Buddhism as unselfish love for all living beings which gradually intensifies and awakens to a purer awareness where the mind withdraws from sensory interests and becomes aware of itself as a single whole.\nThe Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote in his Meditations that conscience was the human capacity to live by rational principles that were congruent with the true, tranquil and harmonious nature of our mind and thereby that of the Universe: \"To move from one unselfish action to another with God in mind. Only there, delight and stillness ... the only rewards of our existence here are an unstained character and unselfish acts.\"\nThe Islamic concept of Taqwa is closely related to conscience. In the Qur’ān verses 2:197 & 22:37 Taqwa refers to \"right conduct\" or \"piety\", \"guarding of oneself\" or \"guarding against evil\". Qur’ān verse 47:17 says that God is the ultimate source of the believer's taqwā which is not simply the product of individual will but requires inspiration from God. In Qur’ān verses 91:7–8, God the Almighty talks about how He has perfected the soul, the conscience and has taught it the wrong (fujūr) and right (taqwā). Hence, the awareness of vice and virtue is inherent in the soul, allowing it to be tested fairly in the life of this world and tried, held accountable on the day of judgment for responsibilities to God and all humans.\nQur’ān verse 49:13 states: \"O humankind! We have created you out of male and female and constituted you into different groups and societies, so that you may come to know each other-the noblest of you, in the sight of God, are the ones possessing taqwā.\" In Islam, according to eminent theologians such as Al-Ghazali, although events are ordained (and written by God in al-Lawh al-Mahfūz, the Preserved Tablet), humans possess free will to choose between wrong and right, and are thus responsible for their actions; the conscience being a dynamic personal connection to God enhanced by knowledge and practise of the Five Pillars of Islam, deeds of piety, repentance, self-discipline and prayer; and disintegrated and metaphorically covered in blackness through sinful acts. Marshall Hodgson wrote the three-volume work: The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization.\nIn the Protestant Christian tradition, Martin Luther insisted in the Diet of Worms that his conscience was captive to the Word of God, and it was neither safe nor right to go against conscience. To Luther, conscience falls within the ethical, rather than the religious, sphere. John Calvin saw conscience as a battleground: \"the enemies who rise up in our conscience against his Kingdom and hinder his decrees prove that God's throne is not firmly established therein\". Many Christians regard following one's conscience as important as, or even more important than, obeying human authority. A Christian view of conscience might be: \"God gave us our conscience so we would know when we break His Law; the guilt we feel when we do something wrong tells us that we need to repent.\" This can sometimes (as with the conflict between William Tyndale and Thomas More over the translation of the Bible into English) lead to moral quandaries: \"Do I unreservedly obey my Church/priest/military/political leader or do I follow my own inner feeling of right and wrong as instructed by prayer and a personal reading of scripture?\" Some contemporary Christian churches and religious groups hold the moral teachings of the Ten Commandments or of Jesus as the highest authority in any situation, regardless of the extent to which it involves responsibilities in law. In the Gospel of John (7:53–8:11) (King James Version) Jesus challenges those accusing a woman of adultery stating: \"'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.' And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one\"  (see Jesus and the woman taken in adultery). In the Gospel of Luke (10: 25–37) Jesus tells the story of how a despised and heretical Samaritan (see Parable of the Good Samaritan) who (out of compassion/pity - the word 'conscience' is not used) helps an injured stranger beside a road, qualifies better for eternal life by loving his neighbor, than a priest who passes by on the other side.\nThis dilemma of obedience in conscience to divine or state law, was demonstrated dramatically in Antigone's defiance of King Creon's order against burying her brother an alleged traitor, appealing to the \"unwritten law\" and to a \"longer allegiance to the dead than to the living\".\nCatholic theology sees conscience as the last practical \"judgment of reason which at the appropriate moment enjoins  to do good and to avoid evil\". The Second Vatican Council (1962–65) describes: \"Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has not laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling him to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil, tells him inwardly at the right movement: do this, shun that. For man has in his heart a law inscribed by God. His dignity lies in observing this law, and by it he will be judged. His conscience is man’s most secret core, and his sanctuary. There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths.\" Thus, conscience is not like the will, nor a habit like prudence, but \"the interior space in which we can listen to and hear the truth, the good, the voice of God. It is the inner place of our relationship with Him, who speaks to our heart and helps us to discern, to understand the path we ought to take, and once the decision is made, to move forward, to remain faithful\" In terms of logic, conscience can be viewed as the practical conclusion of a moral syllogism whose major premise is an objective norm and whose minor premise is a particular case or situation to which the norm is applied. Thus, Catholics are taught to carefully educate themselves as to revealed norms and norms derived therefrom, so as to form a correct conscience. Catholics are also to examine their conscience daily and with special care before confession. Catholic teaching holds that, \"Man has the right to act according to his conscience and in freedom so as personally to make moral decisions. He must not be forced to act contrary to his conscience. Nor must he be prevented from acting according to his conscience, especially in religious matters\". This right of conscience does not allow one to arbitrarily disagree with Church teaching and claim that one is acting in accordance with conscience. A sincere conscience presumes one is diligently seeking moral truth from authentic sources, that is, seeking to conform oneself to that moral truth by listening to the authority established by Christ to teach it. Nevertheless, despite one's best effort, \"t can happen that moral conscience remains in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be performed or already committed ... This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsibility ... In such cases, the person is culpable for the wrong he commits.\" Thus, if one realizes one may have made a mistaken judgment, one's conscience is said to be vincibly erroneous and it is not a valid norm for action. One must first remove the source of error and do one's best to achieve a correct judgment. If, however, one is not aware of one's error or if, despite an honest and diligent effort one cannot remove the error by study or seeking advice, then one's conscience may be said to be invincibly erroneous. It binds since one has subjective certainty that one is correct. The act resulting from acting on the invincibly erroneous conscience is not good in itself, yet this deformed act or material sin against God's right order and the objective norm is not imputed to the person. The formal obedience given to such a judgment of conscience is good. Some Catholics appeal to conscience in order to justify dissent, not on the level of conscience properly understood, but on the level of the principles and norms which are supposed to inform conscience. For example, some priests make on the use of the so-called internal forum solution (which is not sanctioned by the Magisterium) to justify actions or lifestyles incompatible with Church teaching, such as Christ's prohibition of remarriage after divorce or sexual activity outside marriage. The Catholic Church has warned that \"rejection of the Church's authority and her teaching ... can be at the source of errors in judgment in moral conduct\". An example of someone following his conscience to the point of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535). A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.\nJudaism arguably does not require uncompromising obedience to religious authority; the case has been made that throughout Jewish history, rabbis have circumvented laws they found unconscionable, such as capital punishment. Similarly, although an occupation with national destiny has been central to the Jewish faith (see Zionism) many scholars (including Moses Mendelssohn) stated that conscience as a personal revelation of scriptural truth was an important adjunct to the Talmudic tradition. The concept of inner light in the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers is associated with conscience. Freemasonry describes itself as providing an adjunct to religion and key symbols found in a Freemason Lodge are the square and compasses explained as providing lessons that Masons should \"square their actions by the square of conscience\", learn to \"circumscribe their desires and keep their passions within due bounds toward all mankind.\" The historian Manning Clark viewed conscience as one of the comforters that religion placed between man and death but also a crucial part of the quest for grace encouraged by the Book of Job and the Book of Ecclesiastes, leading us to be paradoxically closest to the truth when we suspect that what matters most in life (\"being there when everyone suddenly understands what it has all been for\") can never happen. Leo Tolstoy, after a decade studying the issue (1877–1887), held that the only power capable of resisting the evil associated with materialism and the drive for social power of religious institutions, was the capacity of humans to reach an individual spiritual truth through reason and conscience. Many prominent religious works about conscience also have a significant philosophical component: examples are the works of Al-Ghazali, Avicenna, Aquinas, Joseph Butler and Dietrich Bonhoeffer (all discussed in the philosophical views section).\n### Secular\nThe secular approach to conscience includes psychological, physiological, sociological, humanitarian, and authoritarian views. Lawrence Kohlberg considered critical conscience to be an important psychological stage in the proper moral development of humans, associated with the capacity to rationally weigh principles of responsibility, being best encouraged in the very young by linkage with humorous personifications (such as Jiminy Cricket) and later in adolescents by debates about individually pertinent moral dilemmas. Erik Erikson placed the development of conscience in the 'pre-schooler' phase of his eight stages of normal human personality development. The psychologist Martha Stout terms conscience \"an intervening sense of obligation based in our emotional attachments.\" Thus a good conscience is associated with feelings of integrity, psychological wholeness and peacefulness and is often described using adjectives such as \"quiet\", \"clear\" and \"easy\".\nSigmund Freud regarded conscience as originating psychologically from the growth of civilisation, which periodically frustrated the external expression of aggression: this destructive impulse being forced to seek an alternative, healthy outlet, directed its energy as a superego against the person's own \"ego\" or selfishness (often taking its cue in this regard from parents during childhood). According to Freud, the consequence of not obeying our conscience is guilt, which can be a factor in the development of neurosis; Freud claimed that both the cultural and individual super-ego set up strict ideal demands with regard to the moral aspects of certain decisions, disobedience to which provokes a 'fear of conscience'.\nAntonio Damasio considers conscience an aspect of extended consciousness beyond survival-related dispositions and incorporating the search for truth and desire to build norms and ideals for behavior.\n#### Conscience as a society-forming instinct\nMichel Glautier argues that conscience is one of the instincts and drives which enable people to form societies: groups of humans without these drives or in whom they are insufficient cannot form societies and do not reproduce their kind as successfully as those that do.\nCharles Darwin considered that conscience evolved in humans to resolve conflicts between competing natural impulses-some about self-preservation but others about safety of a family or community; the claim of conscience to moral authority emerged from the \"greater duration of impression of social instincts\" in the struggle for survival. In such a view, behavior destructive to a person's society (either to its structures or to the persons it comprises) is bad or \"evil\". Thus, conscience can be viewed as an outcome of those biological drives that prompt humans to avoid provoking fear or contempt in others; being experienced as guilt and shame in differing ways from society to society and person to person. A requirement of conscience in this view is the capacity to see ourselves from the point of view of another person. Persons unable to do this (psychopaths, sociopaths, narcissists) therefore often act in ways which are \"evil\".\nFundamental in this view of conscience is that humans consider some \"other\" as being in a social relationship. Thus, nationalism is invoked in conscience to quell tribal conflict and the notion of a Brotherhood of Man is invoked to quell national conflicts. Yet such crowd drives may not only overwhelm but redefine individual conscience. Friedrich Nietzsche stated: \"communal solidarity is annihilated by the highest and strongest drives that, when they break out passionately, whip the individual far past the average low level of the 'herd-conscience.'\" Jeremy Bentham noted that: \"fanaticism never sleeps ... it is never stopped by conscience; for it has pressed conscience into its service.\" Hannah Arendt in her study of the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem, notes that the accused, as with almost all his fellow Germans, had lost track of his conscience to the point where they hardly remembered it; this wasn't caused by familiarity with atrocities or by psychologically redirecting any resultant natural pity to themselves for having to bear such an unpleasant duty, so much as by the fact that anyone whose conscience did develop doubts could see no one who shared them: \"Eichmann did not need to close his ears to the voice of conscience ... not because he had none, but because his conscience spoke with a \"respectable voice\", with the voice of the respectable society around him\".\nSir Arthur Keith in 1948 developed the Amity-enmity complex. We evolved as tribal groups surrounded by enemies; thus conscience evolved a dual role; the duty to save and protect members of the in-group, and the duty to show hatred and aggression towards any out-group.\nAn interesting area of research in this context concerns the similarities between our relationships and those of animals, whether animals in human society (pets, working animals, even animals grown for food) or in the wild. One idea is that as people or animals perceive a social relationship as important to preserve, their conscience begins to respect that former \"other\", and urge actions that protect it. Similarly, in complex territorial and cooperative breeding bird communities (such as the Australian magpie) that have a high degree of etiquettes, rules, hierarchies, play, songs and negotiations, rule-breaking seems tolerated on occasions not obviously related to survival of the individual or group; behaviour often appearing to exhibit a touching gentleness and tenderness.\n#### Evolutionary biology\nContemporary scientists in evolutionary biology seek to explain conscience as a function of the brain that evolved to facilitate altruism within societies. In his book The God Delusion, Richard Dawkins states that he agrees with Robert Hinde's Why Good is Good, Michael Shermer's The Science of Good and Evil, Robert Buckman's Can We Be Good Without God? and Marc Hauser's Moral Minds, that our sense of right and wrong can be derived from our Darwinian past. He subsequently reinforced this idea through the lens of the gene-centered view of evolution, since the unit of natural selection is neither an individual organism nor a group, but rather the \"selfish\" gene, and these genes could ensure their own \"selfish\" survival by, inter alia, pushing individuals to act altruistically towards its kin.\n#### Neuroscience and artificial conscience\nNumerous case studies of brain damage have shown that damage to areas of the brain (such as the anterior prefrontal cortex) results in the reduction or elimination of inhibitions, with a corresponding radical change in behaviour. When the damage occurs to adults, they may still be able to perform moral reasoning; but when it occurs to children, they may never develop that ability.\nAttempts have been made by neuroscientists to locate the free will necessary for what is termed the 'veto' of conscience over unconscious mental processes (see Neuroscience of free will and Benjamin Libet) in a scientifically measurable awareness of an intention to carry out an act occurring 350–400 microseconds after the electrical discharge known as the 'readiness potential.'\nJacques Pitrat claims that some kind of artificial conscience is beneficial in artificial intelligence systems to improve their long-term performance and direct their introspective processing.\n### Philosophical\nThe word \"conscience\" derives etymologically from the Latin conscientia, meaning \"privity of knowledge\" or \"with-knowledge\". The English word implies internal awareness of a moral standard in the mind concerning the quality of one's motives, as well as a consciousness of our own actions. Thus conscience considered philosophically may be first, and perhaps most commonly, a largely unexamined \"gut feeling\" or \"vague sense of guilt\" about what ought to be or should have been done. Conscience in this sense is not necessarily the product of a process of rational consideration of the moral features of a situation (or the applicable normative principles, rules or laws) and can arise from parental, peer group, religious, state or corporate indoctrination, which may or may not be presently consciously acceptable to the person (\"traditional conscience\"). Conscience may be defined as the practical reason employed when applying moral convictions to a situation (\"critical conscience\"). In purportedly morally mature mystical people who have developed this capacity through daily contemplation or meditation combined with selfless service to others, critical conscience can be aided by a \"spark\" of intuitive insight or revelation (called marifa in Islamic Sufi philosophy and synderesis in medieval Christian scholastic moral philosophy). Conscience is accompanied in each case by an internal awareness of 'inner light' and approbation or 'inner darkness' and condemnation as well as a resulting conviction of right or duty either followed or declined.\n#### Medieval\nThe medieval Islamic scholar and mystic Al-Ghazali divided the concept of Nafs (soul or self (spirituality)) into three categories based on the Qur’an:\nNafs Ammarah (12:53) which \"exhorts one to freely indulge in gratifying passions and instigates to do evil\" Nafs Lawammah (75:2) which is \"the conscience that directs man towards right or wrong\" Nafs Mutmainnah (89:27) which is \"a self that reaches the ultimate peace\"\nThe medieval Persian philosopher and physician Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi believed in a close relationship between conscience or spiritual integrity and physical health; rather than being self-indulgent, man should pursue knowledge, use his intellect and apply justice in his life. The medieval Islamic philosopher Avicenna, whilst imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, wrote his famous isolated-but-awake \"Floating Man\" sensory deprivation thought experiment to explore the ideas of human self-awareness and the substantiality of the soul; his hypothesis being that it is through intelligence, particularly the active intellect, that God communicates truth to the human mind or conscience. According to the Islamic Sufis conscience allows Allah to guide people to the marifa, the peace or \"light upon light\" experienced where a Muslim's prayers lead to a melting away of the self in the inner knowledge of God; this foreshadowing the eternal Paradise depicted in the Qur’ān.\nSome medieval Christian scholastics such as Bonaventure made a distinction between conscience as a rational faculty of the mind (practical reason) and inner awareness, an intuitive \"spark\" to do good, called synderesis arising from a remnant appreciation of absolute good and when consciously denied (for example to perform an evil act), becoming a source of inner torment. Early modern theologians such as William Perkins and William Ames developed a syllogistic understanding of the conscience, where God's law made the first term, the act to be judged the second and the action of the conscience (as a rational faculty) produced the judgement. By debating test cases applying such understanding conscience was trained and refined (i.e. casuistry).\nIn the 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas regarded conscience as the application of moral knowledge to a particular case (S.T. I, q. 79, a. 13). Thus, conscience was considered an act or judgment of practical reason that began with synderesis, the structured development of our innate remnant awareness of absolute good (which he categorised as involving the five primary precepts proposed in his theory of Natural Law) into an acquired habit of applying moral principles. According to Singer, Aquinas held that conscience, or conscientia was an imperfect process of judgment applied to activity because knowledge of the natural law (and all acts of natural virtue implicit therein) was obscured in most people by education and custom that promoted selfishness rather than fellow-feeling (Summa Theologiae, I–II, I). Aquinas also discussed conscience in relation to the virtue of prudence to explain why some people appear to be less \"morally enlightened\" than others, their weak will being incapable of adequately balancing their own needs with those of others.\nAquinas reasoned that acting contrary to conscience is an evil action but an errant conscience is only blameworthy if it is the result of culpable or vincible ignorance of factors that one has a duty to have knowledge of. Aquinas also argued that conscience should be educated to act towards real goods (from God) which encouraged human flourishing, rather than the apparent goods of sensory pleasures. In his Commentary on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics Aquinas claimed it was weak will that allowed a non-virtuous man to choose a principle allowing pleasure ahead of one requiring moral constraint.\nThomas A Kempis in the medieval contemplative classic The Imitation of Christ (ca 1418) stated that the glory of a good man is the witness of a good conscience. \"Preserve a quiet conscience and you will always have joy. A quiet conscience can endure much, and remains joyful in all trouble, but an evil conscience is always fearful and uneasy.\" The anonymous medieval author of the Christian mystical work The Cloud of Unknowing similarly expressed the view that in profound and prolonged contemplation a soul dries up the \"root and ground\" of the sin that is always there, even after one's confession and however busy one is in holy things: \"therefore, whoever would work at becoming a contemplative must first cleanse his  conscience.\" The medieval Flemish mystic John of Ruysbroeck likewise held that true conscience has four aspects that are necessary to render a man just in the active and contemplative life: \"a free spirit, attracting itself through love\"; \"an intellect enlightened by grace\", \"a delight yielding propension or inclination\" and \"an outflowing losing of oneself in the abyss of ... that eternal object which is the highest and chief blessedness ... those lofty amongst men, are absorbed in it, and immersed in a certain boundless thing.\"\n#### Modern\nBenedict de Spinoza in his Ethics, published after his death in 1677, argued that most people, even those that consider themselves to exercise free will, make moral decisions on the basis of imperfect sensory information, inadequate understanding of their mind and will, as well as emotions which are both outcomes of their contingent physical existence and forms of thought defective from being chiefly impelled by self-preservation. The solution, according to Spinoza, was to gradually increase the capacity of our reason to change the forms of thought produced by emotions and to fall in love with viewing problems requiring moral decision from the perspective of eternity. Thus, living a life of peaceful conscience means to Spinoza that reason is used to generate adequate ideas where the mind increasingly sees the world and its conflicts, our desires and passions sub specie aeternitatis, that is without reference to time. Hegel's obscure and mystical Philosophy of Mind held that the absolute right of freedom of conscience facilitates human understanding of an all-embracing unity, an absolute which was rational, real and true. Nevertheless, Hegel thought that a functioning State would always be tempted not to recognize conscience in its form of subjective knowledge, just as similar non-objective opinions are generally rejected in science. A similar idealist notion was expressed in the writings of Joseph Butler who argued that conscience is God-given, should always be obeyed, is intuitive, and should be considered the \"constitutional monarch\" and the \"universal moral faculty\": \"conscience does not only offer itself to show us the way we should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it.\" Butler advanced ethical speculation by referring to a duality of regulative principles in human nature: first, \"self-love\" (seeking individual happiness) and second, \"benevolence\" (compassion and seeking good for another) in conscience (also linked to the agape of situational ethics). Conscience tended to be more authoritative in questions of moral judgment, thought Butler, because it was more likely to be clear and certain (whereas calculations of self-interest tended to probable and changing conclusions). John Selden in his Table Talk expressed the view that an awake but excessively scrupulous or ill-trained conscience could hinder resolve and practical action; it being \"like a horse that is not well wayed, he starts at every bird that flies out of the hedge\".\nAs the sacred texts of ancient Hindu and Buddhist philosophy became available in German translations in the 18th and 19th centuries, they influenced philosophers such as Schopenhauer to hold that in a healthy mind only deeds oppress our conscience, not wishes and thoughts; \"for it is only our deeds that hold us up to the mirror of our will\"; the good conscience, thought Schopenhauer, we experience after every disinterested deed arises from direct recognition of our own inner being in the phenomenon of another, it affords us the verification \"that our true self exists not only in our own person, this particular manifestation, but in everything that lives. By this the heart feels itself enlarged, as by egotism it is contracted.\"\nImmanuel Kant, a central figure of the Age of Enlightenment, likewise claimed that two things filled his mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and more steadily they were reflected on: \"the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me ... the latter begins from my invisible self, my personality, and exhibits me in a world which has true infinity but which I recognise myself as existing in a universal and necessary (and not only, as in the first case, contingent) connection.\" The 'universal connection' referred to here is Kant's categorical imperative: \"act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\" Kant considered critical conscience to be an internal court in which our thoughts accuse or excuse one another; he acknowledged that morally mature people do often describe contentment or peace in the soul after following conscience to perform a duty, but argued that for such acts to produce virtue their primary motivation should simply be duty, not expectation of any such bliss. Rousseau expressed a similar view that conscience somehow connected man to a greater metaphysical unity. John Plamenatz in his critical examination of Rousseau's work considered that conscience was there defined as the feeling that urges us, in spite of contrary passions, towards two harmonies: the one within our minds and between our passions, and the other within society and between its members; \"the weakest can appeal to it in the strongest, and the appeal, though often unsuccessful, is always disturbing. However, corrupted by power or wealth we may be, either as possessors of them or as victims, there is something in us serving to remind us that this corruption is against nature.\"\nOther philosophers expressed a more sceptical and pragmatic view of the operation of \"conscience\" in society. John Locke in his Essays on the Law of Nature argued that the widespread fact of human conscience allowed a philosopher to infer the necessary existence of objective moral laws that occasionally might contradict those of the state. Locke highlighted the metaethics problem of whether accepting a statement like \"follow your conscience\" supports subjectivist or objectivist conceptions of conscience as a guide in concrete morality, or as a spontaneous revelation of eternal and immutable principles to the individual: \"if conscience be a proof of innate principles, contraries may be innate principles; since some men with the same bent of conscience prosecute what others avoid.\" Thomas Hobbes likewise pragmatically noted that opinions formed on the basis of conscience with full and honest conviction, nevertheless should always be accepted with humility as potentially erroneous and not necessarily indicating absolute knowledge or truth. William Godwin expressed the view that conscience was a memorable consequence of the \"perception by men of every creed when the descend into the scene of busy life\" that they possess free will. Adam Smith considered that it was only by developing a critical conscience that we can ever see what relates to ourselves in its proper shape and dimensions; or that we can ever make any proper comparison between our own interests and those of other people. John Stuart Mill believed that idealism about the role of conscience in government should be tempered with a practical realisation that few men in society are capable of directing their minds or purposes towards distant or unobvious interests, of disinterested regard for others, and especially for what comes after them, for the idea of posterity, of their country, or of humanity, whether grounded on sympathy or on a conscientious feeling. Mill held that certain amount of conscience, and of disinterested public spirit, may fairly be calculated on in the citizens of any community ripe for representative government, but that \"it would be ridiculous to expect such a degree of it, combined with such intellectual discernment, as would be proof against any plausible fallacy tending to make that which was for their class interest appear the dictate of justice and of the general good.\"\nJosiah Royce (1855–1916) built on the transcendental idealism view of conscience, viewing it as the ideal of life which constitutes our moral personality, our plan of being ourself, of making common sense ethical decisions. But, he thought, this was only true insofar as our conscience also required loyalty to \"a mysterious higher or deeper self\". In the modern Christian tradition this approach achieved expression with Dietrich Bonhoeffer who stated during his imprisonment by the Nazis in World War II that conscience for him was more than practical reason, indeed it came from a \"depth which lies beyond a man's own will and his own reason and it makes itself heard as the call of human existence to unity with itself.\" For Bonhoeffer a guilty conscience arose as an indictment of the loss of this unity and as a warning against the loss of one's self; primarily, he thought, it is directed not towards a particular kind of doing but towards a particular mode of being. It protests against a doing which imperils the unity of this being with itself. Conscience for Bonhoeffer did not, like shame, embrace or pass judgment on the morality of the whole of its owner's life; it reacted only to certain definite actions: \"it recalls what is long past and represents this disunion as something which is already accomplished and irreparable\". The man with a conscience, he believed, fights a lonely battle against the \"overwhelming forces of inescapable situations\" which demand moral decisions despite the likelihood of adverse consequences. Simon Soloveychik has similarly claimed that the truth distributed in the world, as the statement about human dignity, as the affirmation of the line between good and evil, lives in people as conscience.\nAs Hannah Arendt pointed out, however, (following the utilitarian John Stuart Mill on this point): a bad conscience does not necessarily signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame by a bad conscience and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of the self. Representing our soul or true self by analogy as our house, Arendt wrote that \"conscience is the anticipation of the fellow who awaits you if and when you come home.\" Arendt believed that people who are unfamiliar with the process of silent critical reflection about what they say and do will not mind contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime, since they can \"count on its being forgotten the next moment;\" bad people are not full of regrets. Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word consciousness from conscience. One reason, she held, was that conscience, as we understand it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like consciousness: \"and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what to do and what to repent; before it became the lumen naturale or Kant's practical reason, it was the voice of God.\"\nAlbert Einstein, as a self-professed adherent of humanism and rationalism, likewise viewed an enlightened religious person as one whose conscience reflects that he \"has, to the best of his ability, liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish desires and is preoccupied with thoughts, feelings and aspirations to which he clings because of their super-personal value.\" Einstein often referred to the \"inner voice\" as a source of both moral and physical knowledge: \"Quantum mechanics is very impressive. But an inner voice tells me that it is not the real thing. The theory produces a good deal but hardly brings one closer to the secrets of the Old One. I am at all events convinced that He does not play dice.\"\nSimone Weil who fought for the French resistance (the Maquis) argued in her final book The Need for Roots: Prelude to a Declaration of Duties Towards Mankind that for society to become more just and protective of liberty, obligations should take precedence over rights in moral and political philosophy and a spiritual awakening should occur in the conscience of most citizens, so that social obligations are viewed as fundamentally having a transcendent origin and a beneficent impact on human character when fulfilled. Simone Weil also in that work provided a psychological explanation for the mental peace associated with a good conscience: \"the liberty of men of goodwill, though limited in the sphere of action, is complete in that of conscience. For, having incorporated the rules into their own being, the prohibited possibilities no longer present themselves to the mind, and have not to be rejected.\"\nAlternatives to such metaphysical and idealist opinions about conscience arose from realist and materialist perspectives such as those of Charles Darwin. Darwin suggested that \"any animal whatever, endowed with well-marked social instincts, the parental and filial affections being here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon as its intellectual powers had become as well, or as nearly as well developed, as in man.\" Émile Durkheim held that the soul and conscience were particular forms of an impersonal principle diffused in the relevant group and communicated by totemic ceremonies. AJ Ayer was a more recent realist who held that the existence of conscience was an empirical question to be answered by sociological research into the moral habits of a given person or group of people, and what causes them to have precisely those habits and feelings. Such an inquiry, he believed, fell wholly within the scope of the existing social sciences. George Edward Moore bridged the idealistic and sociological views of 'critical' and 'traditional' conscience in stating that the idea of abstract 'rightness' and the various degrees of the specific emotion excited by it are what constitute, for many persons, the specifically 'moral sentiment' or conscience. For others, however, an action seems to be properly termed 'internally right', merely because they have previously regarded it as right, the idea of 'rightness' being present in some way to his or her mind, but not necessarily among his or her deliberately constructed motives.\nThe French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir in A Very Easy Death (Une mort très douce, 1964) reflects within her own conscience about her mother's attempts to develop such a moral sympathy and understanding of others.\nMichael Walzer claimed that the growth of religious toleration in Western nations arose amongst other things, from the general recognition that private conscience signified some inner divine presence regardless of the religious faith professed and from the general respectability, piety, self-limitation, and sectarian discipline which marked most of the men who claimed the rights of conscience. Walzer also argued that attempts by courts to define conscience as a merely personal moral code or as sincere belief, risked encouraging an anarchy of moral egotisms, unless such a code and motive was necessarily tempered with shared moral knowledge: derived either from the connection of the individual to a universal spiritual order, or from the common principles and mutual engagements of unselfish people. Ronald Dworkin maintains that constitutional protection of freedom of conscience is central to democracy but creates personal duties to live up to it: \"Freedom of conscience presupposes a personal responsibility of reflection, and it loses much of its meaning when that responsibility is ignored. A good life need not be an especially reflective one; most of the best lives are just lived rather than studied. But there are moments that cry out for self-assertion, when a passive bowing to fate or a mechanical decision out of deference or convenience is treachery, because it forfeits dignity for ease.\" Edward Conze stated it is important for individual and collective moral growth that we recognise the illusion of our conscience being wholly located in our body; indeed both our conscience and wisdom expand when we act in an unselfish way and conversely \"repressed compassion results in an unconscious sense of guilt.\"\nThe philosopher Peter Singer considers that usually when we describe an action as conscientious in the critical sense we do so in order to deny either that the relevant agent was motivated by selfish desires, like greed or ambition, or that he acted on whim or impulse.\nMoral anti-realists debate whether the moral facts necessary to activate conscience supervene on natural facts with a posteriori necessity; or arise a priori because moral facts have a primary intension and naturally identical worlds may be presumed morally identical. It has also been argued that there is a measure of moral luck in how circumstances create the obstacles which conscience must overcome to apply moral principles or human rights and that with the benefit of enforceable property rights and the rule of law, access to universal health care plus the absence of high adult and infant mortality from conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and famine, people in relatively prosperous developed countries have been spared pangs of conscience associated with the physical necessity to steal scraps of food, bribe tax inspectors or police officers, and commit murder in guerrilla wars against corrupt government forces or rebel armies. Roger Scruton has claimed that true understanding of conscience and its relationship with morality has been hampered by an \"impetuous\" belief that philosophical questions are solved through the analysis of language in an area where clarity threatens vested interests. Susan Sontag similarly argued that it was a symptom of psychological immaturity not to recognise that many morally immature people willingly experience a form of delight, in some an erotic breaking of taboo, when witnessing violence, suffering and pain being inflicted on others. Jonathan Glover wrote that most of us \"do not spend our lives on endless landscape gardening of our self\" and our conscience is likely shaped not so much by heroic struggles, as by choice of partner, friends and job, as well as where we choose to live. Garrett Hardin, in a famous article called \"The Tragedy of the Commons\", argues that any instance in which society appeals to an individual exploiting a commons to restrain himself or herself for the general good—by means of his or her conscience—merely sets up a system which, by selectively diverting societal power and physical resources to those lacking in conscience, while fostering guilt (including anxiety about his or her individual contribution to over-population) in people acting upon it, actually works toward the elimination of conscience from the race.\nJohn Ralston Saul expressed the view in The Unconscious Civilization that in contemporary developed nations many people have acquiesced in turning over their sense of right and wrong, their critical conscience, to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology of the free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.\nSome argue on religious or philosophical grounds that it is blameworthy to act against conscience, even if the judgement of conscience is likely to be erroneous (say because it is inadequately informed about the facts, or prevailing moral (humanist or religious), professional ethical, legal and human rights norms). Failure to acknowledge and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others to provide unwarranted justifications for non-virtuous and selfish acts; indeed, insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content, and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint of external, altruistic, normative justification, conscience may be considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned and humanity as a whole. Langston argues that philosophers of virtue ethics have unnecessarily neglected conscience for, once conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in what each society considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little disagreement about how to act. Emmanuel Levinas viewed conscience as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers, developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of freedom of will to use such powers arbitrarily, or with violence, this process being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain control. In other words, the welcoming of the Other, to Levinas, was the very essence of conscience properly conceived; it encouraged our ego to accept the fallibility of assuming things about other people, that selfish freedom of will \"does not have the last word\" and that realising this has a transcendent purpose: \"I am not alone ... in conscience I have an experience that is not commensurate with any a priori  framework-a conceptless experience.\"\n## Conscientious acts and the law\nEnglish humanist lawyers in the 16th and 17th centuries interpreted conscience as a collection of universal principles given to man by god at creation to be applied by reason; this gradually reforming the medieval Roman law-based system with forms of action, written pleadings, use of juries and patterns of litigation such as Demurrer and Assumpsit that displayed an increased concern for elements of right and wrong on the actual facts. A conscience vote in a parliament allows legislators to vote without restrictions from any political party to which they may belong. In his trial in Jerusalem Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann claimed he was simply following legal orders under paragraph 48 of the German Military Code which provided: \"punishability of an action or omission is not excused on the ground that the person considered his behaviour required by his conscience or the prescripts of his religion\". The United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR) which is part of international customary law specifically refers to conscience in Articles 1 and 18. Likewise, the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) mentions conscience in Article 18.1.\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood— United Nations, Universal Declaration on Human Rights Article 1\nEveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance— United Nations, Universal Declaration on Human Rights Article 18\nEveryone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching— United Nations, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Article 18.1\nIt has been argued that these articles provide international legal obligations protecting conscientious objectors from service in the military.\nJohn Rawls in his A Theory of Justice defines a conscientious objector as an individual prepared to undertake, in public (and often despite widespread condemnation), an action of civil disobedience to a legal rule justifying it (also in public) by reference to contrary foundational social virtues (such as justice as liberty or fairness) and the principles of morality and law derived from them. Rawls considered civil disobedience should be viewed as an appeal, warning or admonishment (showing general respect and fidelity to the rule of law by the non-violence and transparency of methods adopted) that a law breaches a community's fundamental virtue of justice. Objections to Rawls' theory include first, its inability to accommodate conscientious objections to the society's basic appreciation of justice or to emerging moral or ethical principles (such as respect for the rights of the natural environment) which are not yet part of it and second, the difficulty of predictably and consistently determining that a majority decision is just or unjust. Conscientious objection (also called conscientious refusal or evasion) to obeying a law, should not arise from unreasoning, naive \"traditional conscience\", for to do so merely encourages infantile abdication of responsibility to calibrate the law against moral or human rights norms and disrespect for democratic institutions. Instead it should be based on \"critical conscience' – seriously thought out, conceptually mature, personal moral or religious beliefs held to be fundamentally incompatible (that is, not merely inconsistent on the basis of selfish desires, whim or impulse), for example, either with all laws requiring conscription for military service, or legal compulsion to fight for or financially support the State in a particular war. A famous example arose when Henry David Thoreau the author of Walden was willingly jailed for refusing to pay a tax because he profoundly disagreed with a government policy and was frustrated by the corruption and injustice of the democratic machinery of the state. A more recent case concerned Kimberly Rivera, a private in the US Army and mother of four children who, having served 3 months in Iraq War decided the conflict was immoral and sought refugee status in Canada in 2012 (see List of Iraq War resisters), but was deported and arrested in the US.\nIn the Second World War, Great Britain granted conscientious-objection status not just to complete pacifists, but to those who objected to fighting in that particular war; this was done partly out of genuine respect, but also to avoid the disgraceful and futile persecutions of conscientious objectors that occurred during the First World War.\nAmnesty International organises campaigns to protect those arrested and or incarcerated as a prisoner of conscience because of their conscientious beliefs, particularly concerning intellectual, political and artistic freedom of expression and association. Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, was the winner of the 2009 Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience Award. In legislation, a conscience clause is a provision in a statute that excuses a health professional from complying with the law (for example legalising surgical or pharmaceutical abortion) if it is incompatible with religious or conscientious beliefs. Expressed justifications for refusing to obey laws because of conscience vary. Many conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons—notably, members of the historic peace churches are pacifist by doctrine. Other objections can stem from a deep sense of responsibility toward humanity as a whole, or from the conviction that even acceptance of work under military orders acknowledges the principle of conscription that should be everywhere condemned before the world can ever become safe for real democracy. A conscientious objector, however, does not have a primary aim of changing the law. John Dewey considered that conscientious objectors were often the victims of \"moral innocency\" and inexpertness in moral training: \"the moving force of events is always too much for conscience\". The remedy was not to deplore the wickedness of those who manipulate world power, but to connect conscience with forces moving in another direction- to build institutions and social environments predicated on the rule of law, for example, \"then will conscience itself have compulsive power instead of being forever the martyred and the coerced.\" As an example, Albert Einstein who had advocated conscientious objection during the First World War and had been a longterm supporter of War Resisters' International reasoned that \"radical pacifism\" could not be justified in the face of Nazi rearmament and advocated a world federalist organization with its own professional army. Samuel Johnson pointed out that an appeal to conscience should not allow the law to bring unjust suffering upon another. Conscience, according to Johnson, was nothing more than a conviction felt by ourselves of something to be done or something to be avoided; in questions of simple unperplexed morality, conscience is very often a guide that may be trusted. But before conscience can conclusively determine what morally should be done, he thought that the state of the question should be thoroughly known. \"No man's conscience\", said Johnson \"can tell him the right of another man ... it is a conscience very ill informed that violates the rights of one man, for the convenience of another.\"\nCivil disobedience as non-violent protest or civil resistance are also acts of conscience, but are designed by those who undertake them chiefly to change, by appealing to the majority and democratic processes, laws or government policies perceived to be incoherent with fundamental social virtues and principles (such as justice, equality or respect for intrinsic human dignity). Civil disobedience, in a properly functioning democracy, allows a minority who feel strongly that a law infringes their sense of justice (but have no capacity to obtain legislative amendments or a referendum on the issue) to make a potentially apathetic or uninformed majority take account of the intensity of opposing views. A notable example of civil resistance or satyagraha (\"satya\" in sanskrit means \"truth and compassion\", \"agraha\" means \"firmness of will\") involved Mahatma Gandhi making salt in India when that act was prohibited by a British statute, in order to create moral pressure for law reform. Rosa Parks similarly acted on conscience in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama refusing a legal order to give up her seat to make room for a white passenger; her action (and the similar earlier act of 15-year-old Claudette Colvin) leading to the Montgomery bus boycott. Rachel Corrie was a US citizen allegedly killed by a bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while involved in direct action (based on the non-violent principles of Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi) to prevent demolition of the home of local Palestinian pharmacist Samir Nasrallah. Al Gore has argued \"If you're a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now, and not done, I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration.\" In 2011, NASA climate scientist James E. Hansen, environmental leader Phil Radford and Professor Bill McKibben were arrested for opposing a tar sands oil pipeline and Canadian renewable energy professor Mark Jaccard was arrested for opposing mountain-top coal mining; in his book Storms of my Grandchildren Hansen calls for similar civil resistance on a global scale to help replace the 'business-as-usual' Kyoto Protocol cap and trade system, with a progressive carbon tax at emission source on the oil, gas and coal industries – revenue being paid as dividends to low carbon footprint families.\nNotable historical examples of conscientious noncompliance in a different professional context included the manipulation of the visa process in 1939 by Japanese Consul-General Chiune Sugihara in Kaunas (the temporary capital of Lithuania between Germany and the Soviet Union) and by Raoul Wallenberg in Hungary in 1944 to allow Jews to escape almost certain death. Ho Feng-Shan the Chinese Consul-General in Vienna in 1939, defied orders from the Chinese ambassador in Berlin to issue Jews with visas for Shanghai. John Rabe a German member of the Nazi Party likewise saved thousands of Chinese from massacre by the Japanese military at Nanking. The White Rose German student movement against the Nazis declared in their 4th leaflet: \"We will not be silent. We are your bad conscience. The White Rose will not leave you in peace!\" Conscientious noncompliance may be the only practical option for citizens wishing to affirm the existence of an international moral order or 'core' historical rights (such as the right to life, right to a fair trial and freedom of opinion) in states where non-violent protest or civil disobedience are met with prolonged arbitrary detention, torture, forced disappearance, murder or persecution. The controversial Milgram experiment into obedience by Stanley Milgram showed that many people lack the psychological resources to openly resist authority, even when they are directed to act callously and inhumanely against an innocent victim.\n## World conscience\nWorld conscience is the universalist idea that with ready global communication, all people on earth will no longer be morally estranged from one another, whether it be culturally, ethnically, or geographically; instead they will conceive ethics from the utopian point of view of the universe, eternity or infinity, rather than have their duties and obligations defined by forces arising solely within the restrictive boundaries of \"blood and territory\".\nOften this derives from a spiritual or natural law perspective, that for world peace to be achieved, conscience, properly understood, should be generally considered as not necessarily linked (often destructively) to fundamentalist religious ideologies, but as an aspect of universal consciousness, access to which is the common heritage of humanity. Thinking predicated on the development of world conscience is common to members of the Global Ecovillage Network such as the Findhorn Foundation, international conservation organisations like Fauna and Flora International, as well as performers of world music such as Alan Stivell. Non-government organizations, particularly through their work in agenda-setting, policy-making and implementation of human rights-related policy, have been referred to as the conscience of the world\nEdward O Wilson has developed the idea of consilience to encourage coherence of global moral and scientific knowledge supporting the premise that \"only unified learning, universally shared, makes accurate foresight and wise choice possible\". Thus, world conscience is a concept that overlaps with the Gaia hypothesis in advocating a balance of moral, legal, scientific and economic solutions to modern transnational problems such as global poverty and global warming, through strategies such as environmental ethics, climate ethics, natural conservation, ecology, cosmopolitanism, sustainability and sustainable development, biosequestration and legal protection of the biosphere and biodiversity. The NGO 350.org, for example, seeks to attract world conscience to the problems associated with elevation in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.\nThe microcredit initiatives of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus have been described as inspiring a \"war on poverty that blends social conscience and business savvy\".\nThe Green party politician Bob Brown (who was arrested by the Tasmanian state police for a conscientious act of civil disobedience during the Franklin Dam protest) expresses world conscience in these terms: \"the universe, through us, is evolving towards experiencing, understanding and making choices about its future'; one example of policy outcomes from such thinking being a global tax (see Tobin tax) to alleviate global poverty and protect the biosphere, amounting to 1/10 of 1% placed on the worldwide speculative currency market. Such an approach sees world conscience best expressing itself through political reforms promoting democratically based globalisation or planetary democracy (for example internet voting for global governance organisations (see world government) based on the model of \"one person, one vote, one value\") which gradually will replace contemporary market-based globalisation.\nThe American cardiologist Bernard Lown and the Russian cardiologist Yevgeniy Chazov were motivated in conscience through studying the catastrophic public health consequences of nuclear war in establishing International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985 and continues to work to \"heal an ailing planet\".Worldwide expressions of conscience contributed to the decision of the French government to halt atmospheric nuclear tests at Mururoa in the Pacific in 1974 after 41 such explosions (although below-ground nuclear tests continued there into the 1990s).\nA challenge to world conscience was provided by an influential 1968 article by Garrett Hardin that critically analyzed the dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest (and, he claimed, the apparently low 'survival-of-the-fittest' value of conscience-led actions) ultimately destroy a shared limited resource, even though each acknowledges such an outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density (and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed), created controversy additionally through his direct deprecation of the role of conscience in achieving individual decisions, policies and laws that facilitate global justice and peace, as well as sustainability and sustainable development of world commons areas, for example including those officially designated such under United Nations treaties (see common heritage of humanity). Areas designated common heritage of humanity under international law include the Moon, Outer Space, deep sea bed, Antarctica, the world cultural and natural heritage (see World Heritage Convention) and the human genome. It will be a significant challenge for world conscience that as world oil, coal, mineral, timber, agricultural and water reserves are depleted, there will be increasing pressure to commercially exploit common heritage of mankind areas.\nThe philosopher Peter Singer has argued that the United Nations Millennium Development Goals represent the emergence of an ethics based not on national boundaries but on the idea of one world. Ninian Smart has similarly predicted that the increase in global travel and communication will gradually draw the world's religions towards a pluralistic and transcendental humanism characterized by an \"open spirit\" of empathy and compassion.\nNoam Chomsky has argued that forces opposing the development of such a world conscience include free market ideologies that valorise corporate greed in nominal electoral democracies where advertising, shopping malls and indebtedness, shape citizens into apathetic consumers in relation to information and access necessary for democratic participation. John Passmore has argued that mystical considerations about the global expansion of all human consciousness, should take into account that if as a species we do become something much superior to what we are now, it will be as a consequence of conscience not only implanting a goal of moral perfectibility, but assisting us to remain periodically anxious, passionate and discontented, for these are necessary components of care and compassion. The Committee on Conscience of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has targeted genocides such as those in Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, the Congo and Chechnya as challenges to the world's conscience. Oscar Arias Sanchez has criticised global arms industry spending as a failure of conscience by nation states: \"When a country decides to invest in arms, rather than in education, housing, the environment, and health services for its people, it is depriving a whole generation of its right to prosperity and happiness. We have produced one firearm for every ten inhabitants of this planet, and yet we have not bothered to end hunger when such a feat is well within our reach. This is not a necessary or inevitable state of affairs. It is a deliberate choice\" (see Campaign Against Arms Trade). US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, after meeting with the 14th Dalai Lama during the 2008 violent protests in Tibet and aftermath said: \"The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world.\" Nelson Mandela, through his example and words, has been described as having shaped the conscience of the world. The Right Livelihood Award is awarded yearly in Sweden to those people, mostly strongly motivated by conscience, who have made exemplary practical contributions to resolving the great challenges facing our planet and its people. In 2009, for example, along with Catherine Hamlin (obstetric fistula and see fistula foundation)), David Suzuki (promoting awareness of climate change) and Alyn Ware (nuclear disarmament), René Ngongo shared the Right Livelihood Award \"for his courage in confronting the forces that are destroying the Congo Basin's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use\". Avaaz is one of the largest global on-line organizations launched in January 2007 to promote conscience-driven activism on issues such as climate change, human rights, animal rights, corruption, poverty, and conflict, thus \"closing the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want\".\n## Notable examples of modern acts based on conscience\nIn a notable contemporary act of conscience, Christian bushwalker Brenda Hean protested against the flooding of Lake Pedder despite threats and that ultimately lead to her death. Another was the campaign by Ken Saro-Wiwa against oil extraction by multinational corporations in Nigeria that led to his execution. So too was the act by the Tank Man, or the Unknown Rebel photographed holding his shopping bag in the path of tanks during the protests at Beijing's Tiananmen Square on 5 June 1989. The actions of United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld to try and achieve peace in the Congo despite the (eventuating) threat to his life, were strongly motivated by conscience as is reflected in his diary, Vägmärken (Markings). Another example involved the actions of Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson, Jr to try and prevent the My Lai Massacre in the Vietnam War. Evan Pederick voluntarily confessed and was convicted of the Sydney Hilton bombing stating that his conscience could not tolerate the guilt and that \"I guess I was quite unique in the prison system in that I had to keep proving my guilt, whereas everyone else said they were innocent.\" Vasili Arkhipov was a Russian naval officer on out-of-radio-contact Soviet submarine B-59 being depth-charged by US warships during the Cuban Missile Crisis whose dissent when two other officers decided to launch a nuclear torpedo (unanimous agreement to launch was required) may have averted a nuclear war. In 1963 Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc performed a famous act of self-immolation to protest against alleged persecution of his faith by the Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem regime.\nConscience played a major role in the actions by anaesthetist Stephen Bolsin to whistleblow (see list of whistleblowers) on incompetent paediatric cardiac surgeons at the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Jeffrey Wigand was motivated by conscience to expose the Big Tobacco scandal, revealing that executives of the companies knew that cigarettes were addictive and approved the addition of carcinogenic ingredients to the cigarettes. David Graham, a Food and Drug Administration employee, was motivated by conscience to whistleblow that the arthritis pain-reliever Vioxx increased the risk of cardiovascular deaths although the manufacturer suppressed this information. Rick Piltz from the U.S. global warming Science Program, blew the whistle on a White House official who ignored majority scientific opinion to edit a climate change report (\"Our Changing Planet\") to reflect the Bush administration's view that the problem was unlikely to exist.\" Muntadhar al-Zaidi, an Iraqi journalist, was imprisoned and allegedly tortured for his act of conscience in throwing his shoes at George W. Bush. Mordechai Vanunu an Israeli former nuclear technician, acted on conscience to reveal details of Israel's nuclear weapons program to the British press in 1986; was kidnapped by Israeli agents, transported to Israel, convicted of treason and spent 18 years in prison, including more than 11 years in solitary confinement.\nAt the awards ceremony for the 200 metres at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City John Carlos, Tommie Smith and Peter Norman ignored death threats and official warnings to take part in an anti-racism protest that destroyed their respective careers. W. Mark Felt an agent of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation who retired in 1973 as the Bureau's Associate Director, acted on conscience to provide reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein with information that resulted in the Watergate scandal. Conscience was a major factor in US Public Health Service officer Peter Buxtun revealing the Tuskegee syphilis experiment to the public. The 2008 attack by the Israeli military on civilian areas of Palestinian Gaza was described as a \"stain on the world's conscience\". Conscience was a major factor in the refusal of Aung San Suu Kyi to leave Burma despite house arrest and persecution by the military dictatorship in that country. Conscience was a factor in Peter Galbraith's criticism of fraud in the 2009 Afghanistan election despite it costing him his United Nations job. Conscience motivated Bunnatine Greenhouse to expose irregularities in the contracting of the Halliburton company for work in Iraq. Naji al-Ali a popular cartoon artist in the Arab world, loved for his defense of the ordinary people, and for his criticism of repression and despotism by both the Israeli military and Yasser Arafat's PLO, was murdered for refusing to compromise with his conscience. The journalist Anna Politkovskaya provided (prior to her murder) an example of conscience in her opposition to the Second Chechen War and then-Russian President Vladimir Putin. Conscience motivated the Russian human rights activist Natalia Estemirova, who was abducted and murdered in Grozny, Chechnya in 2009. The Death of Neda Agha-Soltan arose from conscience-driven protests against the 2009 Iranian presidential election. Muslim lawyer Shirin Ebadi (winner of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize) has been described as the 'conscience of the Islamic Republic' for her work in protecting the human rights of women and children in Iran. The human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, often referred to as the 'conscience of China' and who had previously been arrested and allegedly tortured after calling for respect for human rights and for constitutional reform, was abducted by Chinese security agents in February 2009. 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo in his final statement before being sentenced by a closed Chinese court to over a decade in jail as a political prisoner of conscience stated: \"For hatred is corrosive of a person’s wisdom and conscience; the mentality of enmity can poison a nation’s spirit.\" Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer in Russia, was arrested, held without trial for almost a year and died in custody, as a result of exposing corruption. On 6 October 2001 Laura Whittle was a naval gunner on HMAS Adelaide (FFG 01) under orders to implement a new border protection policy when they encountered the SIEV-4 (Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel-4) refugee boat in choppy seas. After being ordered to fire warning shots from her 50 calibre machinegun to make the boat turn back she saw it beginning to break up and sink with a father on board holding out his young daughter that she might be saved (see Children Overboard Affair). Whittle jumped without a life vest 12 metres into the sea to help save the refugees from drowning thinking \"this isn't right; this isn't how things should be.\" In February 2012 journalist Marie Colvin was deliberately targeted and killed by the Syrian Army in Homs during the 2011–2012 Syrian uprising and Siege of Homs, after she decided to stay at the \"epicentre of the storm\" in order to \"expose what is happening\". In October 2012 the Taliban organised the attempted murder of Malala Yousafzai a teenage girl who had been campaigning, despite their threats, for female education in Pakistan. In December 2012 the 2012 Delhi gang rape case was said to have stirred the collective conscience of India to civil disobedience and public protest at the lack of legal action against rapists in that country (see Rape in India) In June 2013 Edward Snowden revealed details of a US National Security Agency internet and electronic communication PRISM (surveillance program) because of a conscience-felt obligation to the freedom of humanity greater than obedience to the laws that bound his employment.\n## In literature, art, film, and music\nThe ancient epic of the Indian subcontinent, the Mahabharata of Vyasa, contains two pivotal moments of conscience. The first occurs when the warrior Arjuna being overcome with compassion against killing his opposing relatives in war, receives counsel (see Bhagavad-Gita) from Krishna about his spiritual duty (\"work as though you are performing a sacrifice for the general good\"). The second, at the end of the saga, is when king Yudhishthira having alone survived the moral tests of life, is offered eternal bliss, only to refuse it because a faithful dog is prevented from coming with him by purported divine rules and laws. The French author Montaigne (1533–1592) in one of the most celebrated of his essays (\"On experience\") expressed the benefits of living with a clear conscience: \"Our duty is to compose our character, not to compose books, to win not battles and provinces, but order and tranquillity in our conduct. Our great and glorious masterpiece is to live properly\". In his famous Japanese travel journal Oku no Hosomichi (Narrow Road to the Deep North) composed of mixed haiku poetry and prose, Matsuo Bashō (1644–94) in attempting to describe the eternal in this perishable world is often moved in conscience; for example by a thicket of summer grass being all that remains of the dreams and ambitions of ancient warriors. Chaucer's \"Franklin's Tale\" in The Canterbury Tales recounts how a young suitor releases a wife from a rash promise because of the respect in his conscience for the freedom to be truthful, gentle and generous.\nThe critic A. C. Bradley discusses the central problem of Shakespeare's tragic character Hamlet as one where conscience in the form of moral scruples deters the young Prince with his \"great anxiety to do right\" from obeying his father's hell-bound ghost and murdering the usurping King (\"is't not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm?\" (v.ii.67)).\nBradley develops a theory about Hamlet's moral agony relating to a conflict between \"traditional\" and \"critical\" conscience: \"The conventional moral ideas of his time, which he shared with the Ghost, told him plainly that he ought to avenge his father; but a deeper conscience in him, which was in advance of his time, contended with these explicit conventional ideas. It is because this deeper conscience remains below the surface that he fails to recognise it, and fancies he is hindered by cowardice or sloth or passion or what not; but it emerges into light in that speech to Horatio. And it is just because he has this nobler moral nature in him that we admire and love him\". The opening words of Shakespeare's Sonnet 94 (\"They that have pow'r to hurt, and will do none\") have been admired as a description of conscience. So has John Donne's commencement of his poem s:Goodfriday, 1613. Riding Westward: \"Let man's soul be a sphere, and then, in this, Th' intelligence that moves, devotion is;\"\nAnton Chekhov in his plays The Seagull, Uncle Vanya and Three Sisters describes the tortured emotional states of doctors who at some point in their careers have turned their back on conscience. In his short stories, Chekhov also explored how people misunderstood the voice of a tortured conscience. A promiscuous student, for example, in The Fit describes it as a \"dull pain, indefinite, vague; it was like anguish and the most acute fear and despair ... in his breast, under the heart\" and the young doctor examining the misunderstood agony of compassion experienced by the factory owner's daughter in From a Case Book calls it an \"unknown, mysterious power ... in fact close at hand and watching him.\" Characteristically, Chekhov's own conscience drove him on the long journey to Sakhalin to record and alleviate the harsh conditions of the prisoners at that remote outpost. As Irina Ratushinskaya writes in the introduction to that work: \"Abandoning everything, he travelled to the distant island of Sakhalin, the most feared place of exile and forced labour in Russia at that time. One cannot help but wonder why? Simply, because the lot of the people there was a bitter one, because nobody really knew about the lives and deaths of the exiles, because he felt that they stood in greater need of help that anyone else. A strange reason, maybe, but not for a writer who was the epitome of all the best traditions of a Russian man of letters. Russian literature has always focused on questions of conscience and was, therefore, a powerful force in the moulding of public opinion.\"\nE. H. Carr writes of Dostoevsky's character the young student Raskolnikov in the novel Crime and Punishment who decides to murder a 'vile and loathsome' old woman money lender on the principle of transcending conventional morals: \"the sequel reveals to us not the pangs of a stricken conscience (which a less subtle writer would have given us) but the tragic and fruitless struggle of a powerful intellect to maintain a conviction which is incompatible with the essential nature of man.\"\nHermann Hesse wrote his Siddhartha to describe how a young man in the time of the Buddha follows his conscience on a journey to discover a transcendent inner space where all things could be unified and simply understood, ending up discovering that personal truth through selfless service as a ferryman. J. R. R. Tolkien in his epic The Lord of the Rings describes how only the hobbit Frodo is pure enough in conscience to carry the ring of power through war-torn Middle-earth to destruction in the Cracks of Doom, Frodo determining at the end to journey without weapons, and being saved from failure by his earlier decision to spare the life of the creature Gollum. Conor Cruise O'Brien wrote that Albert Camus was the writer most representative of the Western consciousness and conscience in its relation to the non-Western world. Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird portrays Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck in the classic film from the book (see To Kill a Mockingbird)) as a lawyer true to his conscience who sets an example to his children and community.\nThe Robert Bolt play A Man For All Seasons focuses on the conscience of Catholic lawyer Thomas More in his struggle with King Henry VIII (\"the loyal subject is more bounden to be loyal to his conscience than to any other thing\"). George Orwell wrote his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four on the isolated island of Jura, Scotland to describe how a man (Winston Smith) attempts to develop critical conscience in a totalitarian state which watches every action of the people and manipulates their thinking with a mixture of propaganda, endless war and thought control through language control (double think and newspeak) to the point where prisoners look up to and even love their torturers. In the Ministry of Love, Winston's torturer (O'Brien) states: \"You are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us. But we create human nature. Men are infinitely malleable\".\nA tapestry copy of Picasso's Guernica depicting a massacre of innocent women and children during the Spanish civil war is displayed on the wall of the United Nations building in New York City, at the entrance to the Security Council room, demonstrably as a spur to the conscience of representatives from the nation states. Albert Tucker painted Man's Head to capture the moral disintegration, and lack of conscience, of a man convicted of kicking a dog to death.\nThe impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh wrote in a letter to his brother Theo in 1878 that \"one must never let the fire in one's soul die, for the time will inevitably come when it will be needed. And he who chooses poverty for himself and loves it possesses a great treasure and will hear the voice of his conscience address him every more clearly. He who hears that voice, which is God's greatest gift, in his innermost being and follows it, finds in it a friend at last, and he is never alone! ... That is what all great men have acknowledged in their works, all those who have thought a little more deeply and searched and worked and loved a little more than the rest, who have plumbed the depths of the sea of life.\"\nThe 1957 Ingmar Bergman film The Seventh Seal portrays the journey of a medieval knight (Max von Sydow) returning disillusioned from the crusades (\"what is going to happen to those of us who want to believe, but aren't able to?\") across a plague-ridden landscape, undertaking a game of chess with the personification of Death until he can perform one meaningful altruistic act of conscience (overturning the chess board to distract Death long enough for a family of jugglers to escape in their wagon). The 1942 Casablanca centers on the development of conscience in the cynical American Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) in the face of oppression by the Nazis and the example of the resistance leader Victor Laszlo.The David Lean and Robert Bolt screenplay for Doctor Zhivago (an adaptation of Boris Pasternak's novel) focuses strongly on the conscience of a doctor-poet in the midst of the Russian Revolution (in the end \"the walls of his heart were like paper\").The 1982 Ridley Scott film Blade Runner focuses on the struggles of conscience between and within a bounty hunter (Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford)) and a renegade replicant android (Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)) in a future society which refuses to accept that forms of artificial intelligence can have aspects of being such as conscience.\nJohann Sebastian Bach wrote his last great choral composition the Mass in B minor (BWV 232) to express the alternating emotions of loneliness, despair, joy and rapture that arise as conscience reflects on a departed human life. Here JS Bach's use of counterpoint and contrapuntal settings, his dynamic discourse of melodically and rhythmically distinct voices seeking forgiveness of sins (\"Qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis\") evokes a spiraling moral conversation of all humanity expressing his belief that \"with devotional music, God is always present in his grace\".\nLudwig van Beethoven's meditations on illness, conscience and mortality in the Late String Quartets led to his dedicating the third movement of String Quartet in A Minor (1825) Op. 132 (see String Quartet No. 15) as a \"Hymn of Thanksgiving to God of a convalescent\". John Lennon's work \"Imagine\" owes much of its popular appeal to its evocation of conscience against the atrocities created by war, religious fundamentalism and politics. The Beatles George Harrison-written track \"The Inner Light\" sets to Indian raga music a verse from the Tao Te Ching that \"without going out of your door you can know the ways of heaven'. In the 1986 movie The Mission the guilty conscience and penance of the slave trader Mendoza is made more poignant by the haunting oboe music of Ennio Morricone (\"On Earth as it is in Heaven\") The song Sweet Lullaby by Deep Forest is based on a traditional Baegu lullaby from the Solomon Islands called \"Rorogwela\" in which a young orphan is comforted as an act of conscience by his older brother. The Dream Academy song 'Forest Fire' provided an early warning of the moral dangers of our 'black cloud' 'bringing down a different kind of weather ... letting the sunshine in, that's how the end begins.\"\nThe American Society of Journalists and Authors (ASJA) presents the Conscience-in-Media Award to journalists whom the society deems worthy of recognition for demonstrating \"singular commitment to the highest principles of journalism at notable personal cost or sacrifice\".\nThe Ambassador of Conscience Award, Amnesty International's most prestigious human rights award, takes its inspiration from a poem written by Irish Nobel prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney called \"The Republic of Conscience\". Winners of the award have included: Malala Yousafzai, singer and social justice activist Harry Belafonte, musician Peter Gabriel (2008), Nelson Mandela (2006), the Irish rock band U2 (2005), Mary Robinson and Hilda Morales Trujillo (a Guatemalan women's rights activist) (2004) and the author and public intellectual Václav Havel (2003)."], "selected_questions": ["What is the definition of conscience?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": [""], "InternLM_answers": ["Conscience is a person's moral sense of right and wrong.

{"name": "Leptospirosis", "documents": ["# Leptospirosis\nLeptospirosis is a blood infection caused by the bacteria Leptospira. Signs and symptoms can range from none to mild (headaches, muscle pains, and fevers) to severe (bleeding in the lungs or meningitis). Weil's disease, the acute, severe form of leptospirosis, causes the infected individual to become jaundiced (skin and eyes become yellow), develop kidney failure, and bleed. Bleeding from the lungs associated with leptospirosis is known as severe pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome.\nMore than ten genetic types of Leptospira cause disease in humans. Both wild and domestic animals can spread the disease, most commonly rodents. The bacteria are spread to humans through animal urine, or water and soil contaminated with animal urine, coming into contact with the eyes, mouth, nose or breaks in the skin. In developing countries, the disease occurs most commonly in farmers and low-income people who live in areas with poor sanitation. In developed countries, it occurs during heavy downpours and is a risk to sewage workers and those involved in outdoor activities in warm and wet areas. Diagnosis is typically by testing for antibodies against the bacteria or finding bacterial DNA in the blood.\nEfforts to prevent the disease include protective equipment to block contact when working with potentially infected animals, washing after contact, and reducing rodents in areas where people live and work. The antibiotic doxycycline is effective in preventing leptospirosis infection. Human vaccines are of limited usefulness; vaccines for other animals are more widely available. Treatment when infected is with antibiotics such as doxycycline, penicillin, or ceftriaxone. The overall risk of death is 5–10%. However, when the lungs are involved, the risk of death increases to the range of 50–70%.\nIt is estimated that one million severe cases of leptospirosis occur every year, causing about 58,900 deaths. The disease is most common in tropical areas of the world but may occur anywhere. Outbreaks may arise after heavy rainfall. The disease was first described by physician Adolf Weil in 1886 in Germany. Infected animals may have no, mild or severe symptoms. These may vary by the type of animal. In some animals Leptospira live in the reproductive tract, leading to transmission during mating.\n## Signs and symptoms\nThe symptoms of leptospirosis usually appear one to two weeks after infection, but the incubation period can be as long as a month. The illness is biphasic in a majority of symptomatic cases. Symptoms of the first phase (acute or leptospiremic phase) last five to seven days. In the second phase (immune phase), the symptoms resolve as antibodies against the bacteria are produced. Additional symptoms develop in the second phase. The phases of illness may not be distinct, especially in patients with severe illness. 90% of those infected experience mild symptoms while 10% experience severe leptospirosis.\nLeptospiral infection in humans causes a range of symptoms, though some infected persons may have none. The disease begins suddenly with fever accompanied by chills, intense headache, severe muscle aches and abdominal pain. A headache brought on by leptospirosis causes throbbing pain and is characteristically located at the head's bilateral temporal or frontal regions. The person could also have pain behind the eyes and a sensitivity to light. Muscle pain usually involves the calf muscle and the lower back. The most characteristic feature of leptospirosis is the conjunctival suffusion (conjunctivitis without exudate) which is rarely found in other febrile illnesses. Other characteristic findings on the eye include subconjunctival bleeding and jaundice. A rash is rarely found in leptospirosis. When one is found alternative diagnoses such as dengue fever and chikungunya fever should be considered. Dry cough is observed in 20–57% of people with leptospirosis. Thus, this clinical feature can mislead a doctor to diagnose the disease as a respiratory illness. Additionally, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea frequently occur. Vomiting and diarrhea may contribute to dehydration. The abdominal pain can be due to acalculous cholecystitis or inflammation of the pancreas. Rarely, the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen may be enlarged and palpable.\nThere will be a resolution of symptoms for one to three days. The immune phase starts after this and can last from four to 30 days and can be anything from brain to kidney complications. The hallmark of the second phase is inflammation of the membranes covering the brain. Signs and symptoms of meningitis include severe headache and neck stiffness. Kidney involvement is associated with reduced or absent urine output.\nThe classic form of severe leptospirosis, known as Weil's disease, is characterised by liver damage (causing jaundice), kidney failure, and bleeding, which happens in 5–10% of those infected. Lung and brain damage can also occur. For those with signs of inflammation of membranes covering the brain and the brain itself, altered level of consciousness can happen. A variety of neurological problems such as paralysis of half of the body, complete inflammation of a whole horizontal section of spinal cord, and muscle weakness due to immune damage of the nerves supplying the muscles are the complications. Signs of bleeding such as non-traumatic bruises at 1 mm (0.039 in), non-traumatic bruises more than 1 cm (0.39 in), nose bleeding, blackish stools due to bleeding in the stomach, vomiting blood and bleeding from the lungs can also be found. Prolongation of prothrombin time in coagulation testing is associated with severe bleeding manifestation. However, low platelet count is not associated with severe bleeding. Pulmonary haemorrhage is alveolar haemorrhage (bleeding into the alveoli of the lungs) leading to massive coughing up of blood, and causing acute respiratory distress syndrome, where the risk of death is more than 50%. Rarely, inflammation of the heart muscles, inflammation of membranes covering the heart, abnormalities in the heart's natural pacemaker and abnormal heart rhythms may occur.\n## Cause\n### Bacteria\nLeptospirosis is caused by spirochaete bacteria that belong to the genus Leptospira, which are aerobic, right-handed helical, and 6–20 micrometers long. Like Gram-negative bacteria, Leptospira have an outer membrane studded with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the surface, an inner membrane and a layer of peptidoglycan cell wall. However, unlike Gram-negative bacteria, the peptidoglycan layer in Leptospira lies closer to the inner than the outer membrane. This results in a fluid outer membrane loosely associated with the cell wall. In addition, Leptospira have a flagellum located in the periplasm, associated with corkscrew style movement. Chemoreceptors at the poles of the bacteria sense various substrates and change the direction of its movement. The bacteria are traditionally visualised using dark-field microscopy without staining.\nA total of 66 species of Leptospira has been identified. Based on their genomic sequence, they are divided into two clades and four subclades: P1, P2, S1, and S2. The 19 members of the P1 subclade include the 8 species that can cause severe disease in humans: L. alexanderi, L. borgpetersenii, L. interrogans, L. kirschneri, L. mayottensis, L. noguchii, L. santarosai, and L. weilii. The P2 clade comprises 21 species that may cause mild disease in humans. The remaining 26 species comprise the S1 and S2 subclades, which include \"saprophytes\" known to consume decaying matter (saprotrophic nutrition). Pathogenic Leptospira do not multiply in the environment. Leptospira require high humidity for survival but can remain alive in environments such as stagnant water or contaminated soil. The bacterium can be killed by temperatures of 50 °C (122 °F) and can be inactivated by 70% ethanol, 1% sodium hypochlorite, formaldehyde, detergents and acids.\nLeptospira are also classified based on their serovar. The diverse sugar composition of the lipopolysaccharide on the surface of the bacteria is responsible for the antigenic difference between serovars. About 300 pathogenic serovars of Leptospira are recognised. Antigenically related serovars (belonging to the same serogroup) may belong to different species because of horizontal gene transfer of LPS biosynthetic genes between different species. Currently, the cross agglutination absorption test and DNA-DNA hybridisation are used to classify Leptospira species, but are time consuming. Therefore, total genomic sequencing could potentially replace these two methods as the new gold standard of classifying Leptospira species.\n### Transmission\nThe bacteria can be found in ponds, rivers, puddles, sewers, agricultural fields and moist soil. Pathogenic Leptospira have been found in the form of aquatic biofilms, which may aid survival in the environment.\nThe number of cases of leptospirosis is directly related to the amount of rainfall, making the disease seasonal in temperate climates and year-round in tropical climates. The risk of contracting leptospirosis depends upon the risk of disease carriage in the community and the frequency of exposure. In rural areas, farming and animal husbandry are the major risk factors for contracting leptospirosis. Poor housing and inadequate sanitation also increase the risk of infection. In tropical and semi-tropical areas, the disease often becomes widespread after heavy rains or after flooding.\nLeptospira are found mostly in mammals. However, reptiles and cold-blooded animals such as frogs, snakes, turtles, and toads have been shown to have the infection. Whether there are reservoirs of human infection is unknown. Rats, mice, and moles are important primary hosts, but other mammals including dogs, deer, rabbits, hedgehogs, cows, sheep, swine, raccoons, opossums, and skunks can also carry the disease. In Africa, a number of wildlife hosts have been identified as carriers, including the banded mongoose, Egyptian fox, Rusa deer, and shrews. There are various mechanisms whereby animals can infect each other. Dogs may lick the urine of an infected animal off the grass or soil, or drink from an infected puddle. House-bound domestic dogs have contracted leptospirosis, apparently from licking the urine of infected mice in the house. Leptospirosis can also be transmitted via the semen of infected animals. The duration of bacteria being consistently present in animal urine may persist for years.\nHumans are the accidental host of Leptospira. Humans become infected through contact with water or moist soil that contains urine from infected animals. The bacteria enter through cuts, abrasions, ingestion of contaminated food, or contact with mucous membrane of the body (e.g. mouth, nose, and eyes). Occupations at risk of contracting leptospirosis include farmers, fishermen, garbage collectors and sewage workers. The disease is also related to adventure tourism and recreational activities. It is common among water-sports enthusiasts in specific areas, including triathlons, water rafting, canoeing and swimming, as prolonged immersion in water promotes the entry of the bacteria. However, Leptospira are unlikely to penetrate intact skin. The disease is not known to spread between humans, and bacterial dissemination in recovery period is extremely rare in humans. Once humans are infected, bacterial shedding from the kidneys usually persists for up to 60 days.\nRarely, leptospirosis can be transmitted through an organ transplant. Infection through the placenta during pregnancy is also possible. It can cause miscarriage and infection in infants. Leptospirosis transmission through eating raw meat of wildlife animals have also been reported (e.g. psychiatric patients with allotriophagy).\n## Pathogenesis\nWhen animals ingest the bacteria, they circulate in the bloodstream, then lodge themselves into the kidneys through the glomerulular or peritubular capillaries. The bacteria then pass into the lumens of the renal tubules and colonise the brush border and proximal convoluted tubule. This causes the continuous shedding of bacteria in the urine without the animal experiencing significant ill effects. This relationship between the animal and the bacteria is known as a commensal relationship, and the animal is known as a reservoir host.\nHumans are the accidental host of Leptospira. The pathogenesis of leptospirosis remains poorly understood despite research efforts. The bacteria enter the human body through either breaches in the skin or the mucous membrane, then into the bloodstream. The bacteria later attach to the endothelial cells of the blood vessels and extracellular matrix (complex network of proteins and carbohydrates present between cells). The bacteria use their flagella for moving between cell layers. They bind to cells such as fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial cells, and kidney epithelial cells. They also bind to several human proteins such as complement proteins, thrombin, fibrinogen, and plasminogen using surface leptospiral immunoglobulin-like (Lig) proteins such as LigB and LipL32, whose genes are found in all pathogenic species.\nThrough innate immune system, endothelial cells of the capillaries in the human body are activated by the presence of these bacteria. The endothelial cells produce cytokines and antimicrobial peptides against the bacteria. These products regulate the coagulation cascade and movements of white blood cells. Macrophages presented in humans are able to engulf Leptospira. However, Leptospira are able to reside and proliferate in the cytoplasmic matrix after being ingested by macrophages. Those with severe leptospirosis can experience a high level of cytokines such as interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 10. The high level of cytokines causes sepsis-like symptoms which is life-threatening instead of helping to fight against the infection. Those who have a high risk of sepsis during a leptospirosis infection are found to have the HLA-DQ6 genotype, possibly due to superantigen activation, which damages bodily organs.\nLeptospira LPS only activates toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in monocytes in humans. The lipid A molecule of the bacteria is not recognised by human TLR4 receptors. Therefore, the lack of Leptospira recognition by TLR4 receptors probably contributes to the leptospirosis disease process in humans.\nAlthough there are various mechanisms in the human body to fight against the bacteria, Leptospira is well adapted to such an inflammatory condition created by it. In the bloodstream, it can activate host plasminogen to become plasmin that breaks down extracellular matrix, degrades fibrin clots and complemental proteins (C3b and C5) to avoid opsonisation. It can also recruit complement regulators such as Factor H, C4b-binding protein, factor H-like binding protein, and vitronectin to prevent the activation of membrane attack complex on its surface. It also secretes proteases to degrade complement proteins such as C3. It can bind to thrombin that decreases the fibrin formation. Reduced fibrin formation increases the risk of bleeding. Leptospira also secretes sphingomyelinase and haemolysin that target red blood cells.\nLeptospira spreads rapidly to all organs through the bloodstream. They mainly affect the liver. They invade spaces between hepatocytes, causing apoptosis. The damaged hepatocytes and hepatocyte intercellular junctions cause leakage of bile into the bloodstream, causing elevated levels of bilirubin, resulting in jaundice. Congested liver sinusoids and perisinusoidal spaces have been reported. Meanwhile, in the lungs, petechiae or frank bleeding can be found at the alveolar septum and spaces between alveoli. Leptospira secretes toxins that cause mild to severe kidney failure or interstitial nephritis. The kidney failure can recover completely or lead to atrophy and fibrosis. Rarely, inflammation of the heart muscles, coronary arteries, and aorta are found.\n## Diagnosis\n### Laboratory tests\nFor those who are infected, a complete blood count may show a high white cell count and a low platelet count. When a low haemoglobin count is present together with a low white cell count and thrombocytopenia, bone marrow suppression should be considered. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein may also be elevated.\nThe kidneys are commonly involved in leptospirosis. Blood urea and creatinine levels will be elevated. Leptospirosis increases potassium excretion in urine, which leads to a low potassium level and a low sodium level in the blood. Urinalysis may reveal the presence of protein, white blood cells, and microscopic haematuria. Because the bacteria settle in the kidneys, urine cultures will be positive for leptospirosis starting after the second week of illness until 30 days of infection.\nFor those with liver involvement, transaminases and direct bilirubin are elevated in liver function tests. The Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup is associated with jaundice and elevated bilirubin levels. Hemolytic anemia contributes to jaundice. A feature of leptospirosis is acute haemolytic anaemia and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, especially in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Abnormal serum amylase and lipase levels (associated with pancreatitis) are found in those who are admitted to hospital due to leptospirosis. Impaired kidney function with creatinine clearance less than 50 ml/min is associated with elevated pancreatic enzymes.\nFor those with severe headache who show signs of meningitis, a lumbar puncture can be attempted. If infected, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination shows lymphocytic predominance with a cell count of about 500/mm3, protein between 50 and 100 mg/ml and normal glucose levels. These findings are consistent with aseptic meningitis.\n#### Serological tests\nRapid detection of Leptospira can be done by quantifying the IgM antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Typically, L. biflexa antigen is used to detect the IgM antibodies. This test can quickly determine the diagnosis and help in early treatment. However, the test specificity depends upon the type of antigen used and the presence of antibodies from previous infections. The presence of other diseases such as Epstein–Barr virus infection, viral hepatitis, and cytomegalovirus infection can cause false-positive results. Other rapid screening tests have been developed such as dipsticks, latex and slide agglutination tests.\nThe microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is the reference test for the diagnosis of leptospirosis. MAT is a test where serial dilutions of patient sera are mixed with different serovars of Leptospira. The mixture is then examined under a dark field microscope to look for agglutination. The highest dilution where 50% agglutination occurs is the result. MAT titres of 1:100 to 1:800 are diagnostic of leptospirosis. A fourfold or greater rise in titre of two sera taken at symptoms' onset and three to 10 days of disease onset confirms the diagnosis. During the acute phase of the disease, MAT is not specific in detecting a serotype of Leptospira because of cross-reactivity between the serovars. In the convalescent phase, MAT is more specific in detecting the serovar types. MAT requires a panel of live antigens and requires laborious work.\n#### Molecular tests\nLeptospiral DNA can be amplified by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from serum, urine, aqueous humour, CSF, and autopsy specimens. It detects the presence of bacteria faster than MAT during the first few days of infection without waiting for the appearance of antibodies. As PCR detects the presence of leptospiral DNA in the blood it is useful even when the bacteria is killed by antibiotics.\n### Imaging\nIn those who have lung involvement, a chest X-ray may demonstrate diffuse alveolar opacities.\n### Diagnostic criteria\nIn 1982, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed the Faine's criteria for the diagnosis of leptospirosis. It consists of three parts: A (clinical findings), B (epidemiological factors), and C (lab findings and bacteriological data). Since the original Faine's criteria only included culture and MAT in part C, which is difficult and complex to perform, the modified Faine's criteria was proposed in 2004 to include ELISA and slide agglutination tests which are easier to perform. In 2012, modified Faine's criteria (with amendment) was proposed to include shortness of breath and coughing up blood in the diagnosis. In 2013, India recommended modified Faine's criteria in the diagnosis of leptospirosis.\n## Prevention\nRates of leptospirosis can be reduced by improving housing, infrastructure, and sanitation standards. Rodent abatement efforts and flood mitigation projects can also help to prevent it. Proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by people who have a high risk of occupational exposure can prevent leptospirosis infections in most cases.\nThere is no human vaccine suitable for worldwide use. Only a few countries such as Cuba, Japan, France, and China have approved the use of inactivated vaccines with limited protective effects. Side effects such as nausea, injection site redness and swelling have been reported after the vaccine was injected. Since the immunity induced by one Leptospiraserovar is only protective against that specific one, trivalent vaccines have been developed. However, they do not confer long-lasting immunity to humans or animals. Vaccines for other animals are more widely available.\nDoxycycline is given once a week as a prophylaxis and is effective in reducing the rate of leptospirosis infections amongst high-risk individuals in flood-prone areas. In one study, it reduced the number of leptospirosis cases in military personnel undergoing exercises in the jungles. In another study, it reduced the number of symptomatic cases after exposure to leptospirosis under heavy rainfall in endemic areas.\n## Treatment\nMost leptospiral cases resolve spontaneously. Early initiation of antibiotics may prevent the progression to severe disease. Therefore, in resource-limited settings, antibiotics can be started once leptospirosis is suspected after history taking and examination.\nFor mild leptospirosis, antibiotic recommendations such as doxycycline, azithromycin, ampicillin and amoxicillin were based solely on in vitro testing. In 2001, the WHO recommended oral doxycycline (2 mg/kg up to 100 mg every 12 hours) for five to seven days for those with mild leptospirosis. Tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin can also be used in such cases. However, in areas where rickettsia and leptospirosis are both endemic, azithromycin and doxycycline are the drugs of choice.\nBased on a 1988 study, intravenous (IV) benzylpenicillin (also known as penicillin G) is recommended for the treatment of severe leptospirosis. Intravenous benzylpenicillin (30 mg/kg up to 1.2 g every six hours) is used for five to seven days. Amoxicillin, ampicillin, and erythromycin may also be used for severe cases. Ceftriaxone (1 g IV every 24 hours for seven days) is also effective for severe leptospirosis. Cefotaxime (1 g IV every six hours for seven days) and doxycycline (200 mg initially followed by 100 mg IV every 12 hours for seven days) are equally effective as benzylpenicillin (1.5 million units IV every six hours for seven days). Therefore, there is no evidence on differences in death reduction when benzylpenicillin is compared with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. Another study conducted in 2007 also showed no difference in efficacy between doxycycline (200 mg initially followed by 100 mg orally every 12 hours for seven days) or azithromycin (2 g on day one followed by 1 g daily for two more days) for suspected leptospirosis. There was no difference in the resolution of fever and azithromycin is better tolerated than doxycycline.\nOutpatients are given doxycycline or azithromycin. Doxycycline can shorten the duration of leptospirosis by two days, improve symptoms, and prevent the shedding of organisms in their urine. Azithromycin and amoxicillin are given to pregnant women and children. Rarely, a Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction can develop in the first few hours after antibiotic administration. However, according to a meta-analysis done in 2012, the benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of leptospirosis was unclear although the use of antibiotics may reduce the duration of illness by two to four days. Another meta-analysis done in 2013 reached a similar conclusion.\nFor those with severe leptospirosis, including potassium wasting with high kidney output dysfunction, intravenous hydration and potassium supplements can prevent dehydration and hypokalemia. When acute kidney failure occurs, early initiation of haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis can help to improve survival. For those with respiratory failure, tracheal intubation with low tidal volume improves survival rates.\nCorticosteroids have been proposed to suppress inflammation in leptospirosis because Leptospira infection can induce the release of chemical signals which promote inflammation of blood vessels in the lungs. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the use of corticosteroids is beneficial.\n## Prognosis\nThe overall risk of death for leptospirosis is 5–10%. For those with jaundice, the case fatality can increase up to 15%. For those infected who present with confusion and neurological signs, there is a high risk of death. Other factors that increase the risk of death include reduced urine output, age more than 36 years, and respiratory failure. With proper care, most of those infected will recover completely. Those with acute kidney failure may develop persistent mild kidney impairment after they recover. In those with severe lung involvement, the risk of death is 50–70%. Thirty percent of people with acute leptospirosis complained of long-lasting symptoms characterised by weakness, muscle pain, and headaches.\n### Eye complications\nEye problems can occur in 10% of those who recovered from leptospirosis in the range from two weeks to a few years post-infection. Most commonly, eye complications can occur at six months after the infection. This is due to the immune privilege of the eye which protects it from immunological damage during the initial phase of leptospiral infection. These complications can range from mild anterior uveitis to severe panuveitis (which involves all three vascular layers of the eye). The uveitis is more commonly happen in young to a middle-aged man and those working in agricultural farming. In up to 80% of those infected, Leptospira DNA can be found in the aqueous humour of the eye. Eye problems usually have a good prognosis following treatment or they are self-limiting. In anterior uveitis, only topical steroids and mydriatics (an agent that causes dilation of the pupil) are needed while in panuveitis, it requires periocular corticosteroids. Leptospiral uveitis is characterised by hypopyon, rapidly maturing cataract, free floating vitreous membranes, disc hyperemia and retinal vasculitis.\n## Epidemiology\nIt is estimated that one million severe cases of leptospirosis occur annually, with 58,900 deaths. Severe cases account for 5–15% of all leptospirosis cases. Leptospirosis is found in both urban and rural areas in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. The global health burden for leptospirosis can be measured by disability-adjusted life year (DALY). The score is 42 per 100,000 people per year, which is more than other diseases such as rabies and filariasis.\nThe disease is observed persistently in parts of Asia, Oceania, the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. Antarctica is the only place not affected by leptospirosis. In the United States, there were 100 to 150 leptospirosis cases annually. In 1994, leptospirosis ceased to be a notifiable disease in the United States except in 36 states/territories where it is prevalent such as Hawaii, Texas, California, and Puerto Rico. About 50% of the reported cases occurred in Puerto Rico. In January 2013, leptospirosis was reinstated as a nationally notifiable disease in the United States. Research on epidemiology of leptospirosis in high-risk groups and risk factors is limited in India.\nThe global rates of leptospirosis have been underestimated because most affected countries lack notification or notification is not mandatory. Distinguishing clinical signs of leptospirosis from other diseases and lack of laboratory diagnostic services are other problems. The socioeconomic status of many of the world's population is closely tied to malnutrition; subsequent lack of micronutrients may lead to increased risk of infection and death due to leptospirosis infection. Micronutrients such as iron, calcium, and magnesium represent important areas for future research.\n## History\nThe disease was first described by Adolf Weil in 1886 when he reported an \"acute infectious disease with enlargement of spleen, jaundice, and nephritis.\" Before Weil's description, the disease was known as \"rice field jaundice\" in ancient Chinese text, \"autumn fever\", \"seven-day fever\", and \"nanukayami fever\" in Japan; in Europe and Australia, the disease was associated with certain occupations and given names such as \"cane-cutter's disease\", \"swine-herd's disease\", and \"Schlammfieber\" (mud fever). It has been known historically as \"black jaundice\", or \"dairy farm fever\" in New Zealand. Leptospirosis was postulated as the cause of an epidemic among Native Americans along the coast of what is now New England during 1616–19. The disease was most likely brought to the New World by Europeans.\nLeptospira was first observed in 1907 in a post mortem kidney tissue slice by Arthur Stimson using silver deposition staining technique. He called the organism Spirocheta interrogans because the bacteria resembled a question mark. In 1908, a Japanese research group led by Ryukichi Inada and Yutaka Ito first identified this bacterium as the causative agent of leptospirosis and noted its presence in rats in 1916. Japanese coal mine workers frequently contracted leptospirosis. In Japan, the organism was named Spirocheta icterohaemorrhagiae. The Japanese group also experimented with the first leptospiral immunisation studies in guinea pigs. They demonstrated that by injecting the infected guinea pigs with sera from convalescent humans or goats, passive immunity could be provided to the guinea pigs. In 1917, the Japanese group discovered rats as the carriers of leptospirosis. Unaware of the Japanese group's work, two German groups independently and almost simultaneously published their first demonstration of transmitting leptospiral infection in guinea pigs in October 1915. They named the organism Spirochaeta nodosa and Spirochaeta Icterogenes respectively.\nLeptospirosis was subsequently recognised as a disease of all mammalian species. In 1933, Dutch workers reported the isolation of Leptospira canicola which specifically infects dogs. In 1940, the strain that specifically infects cattle was first reported in Russia. In 1942, soldiers at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, were recorded to have an infectious disease which caused a rash over their shinbones. This disease was later known to be caused by leptospirosis. By the 1950s, the number of serovars that infected various mammals had expanded significantly. In the 1980s, leptospirosis was recognised as a veterinary disease of major economic importance.\nIn 1982, there were about 200 serovars of Leptospira available for classification. The International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology's subcommittee on taxonomy of Leptospira proposed classifying these serovars into two big groups: L. interrogans containing pathogenic serovars and L. biflexa containing saprophytic serovars. In 1979, the leptospiral family of Leptospiraceae was proposed. In the same year, Leptospira illini was reclassified as the new genus Leptonema. In 2002, \"Lepthangamushi syndrome\" was coined to describe a series of overlapping symptoms of leptospirosis with Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, and scrub typhus caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. In 2005, Leptospira parva was classified as Turneriella. With DNA-DNA hybridisation technology, L. interrogans was divided into seven species. More Leptospira species have been discovered since then. The WHO established the Leptospirosis Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (LERG) to review the latest disease epidemiological data of leptospirosis, formulate a disease transmission model, and identify gaps in knowledge and research. The first meeting was convened in 2009. In 2011, LERG estimated that the global yearly rate of leptospirosis is five to 14 cases per 100,000 population.\n## Other animals\nInfected animals can have no, mild, or severe symptoms; the presenting symptoms may vary by the type of animal. In some animals the bacteria live in the reproductive tract, leading to transmission during mating.\nAnimals also present with similar clinical features when compared to humans. Clinical signs can appear in 5–15 days in dogs. The incubation period can be prolonged in cats. Leptospirosis can cause abortions after 2–12 weeks in cattle, and 1–4 weeks of infection in pigs. The illness tends to be milder in reservoir hosts. The most commonly affected organs are the kidneys, liver, and reproductive system, but other organs can be affected. In dogs, the acute clinical signs include fever, loss of appetite, shivering, muscle pain, weakness, and urinary symptoms. Vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain may also present. Petechiae and ecchymoses may be seen on mucous membranes. Bleeding from the lungs may also be seen in dogs. In chronic presentations, the affected dog may have no symptoms. In animals that have died of leptospirosis, their kidneys may be swollen with grey and white spots, mottling, or scarring. Their liver may be enlarged with areas of cell death. Petechiae and ecchymoses may be found in various organs. Inflammation of the blood vessels, inflammation of the heart, meningeal layers covering the brain and spinal cord, and uveitis are also possible. Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is the most common disease associated with Leptospira infection in horses in North America and may lead to blindness. ERU is an autoimmune disease involving antibodies against Leptospira proteins LruA and LruB cross-reacting with eye proteins. Live Leptospira can be recovered from the aqueous or vitreous fluid of many horses with Leptospira-associated ERU. Risk of death or disability in infected animals varies depending upon the species and age of the animals. In adult pigs and cattle, reproductive signs are the most common signs of leptospirosis. Up to 40% of cows may have a spontaneous abortion. Younger animals usually develop more severe disease. About 80% of dogs can survive with treatment, but the survival rate is reduced if the lungs are involved.\nELISA and microscopic agglutination tests are most commonly used to diagnose leptospirosis in animals. The bacteria can be detected in blood, urine, and milk or liver, kidney, or other tissue samples by using immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical or polymerase chain reaction techniques. Silver staining or immunogold silver staining is used to detect Leptospira in tissue sections. The organisms stain poorly with Gram stain. Dark-field microscopy can be used to detect Leptospira in body fluids, but it is neither sensitive nor specific in detecting the organism. A positive culture for leptospirosis is definitive, but the availability is limited, and culture results can take 13–26 weeks for a result, limiting its utility. Paired acute and convalescent samples are preferred for serological diagnosis of leptospirosis in animals. A positive serological sample from an aborted fetus is also diagnostic of leptospirosis.\nVarious antibiotics such as doxycycline, penicillins, dihydrostreptomycin, and streptomycin have been used to treat leptospirosis in animals. Fluid therapy, blood transfusion, and respiratory support may be required in severe disease. For horses with ERU, the primary treatment is with anti-inflammatory drugs.\nLeptospirosis vaccines are available for animals such as pigs, dogs, cattle, sheep, and goats. Vaccines for cattle usually contain Leptospira serovar Hardjo and Pomona, for dogs, the vaccines usually contain serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae and Canicola. Vaccines containing multiple serovars do not work for cattle as well as vaccines containing a single serovar, yet the multivalent vaccines continue to be sold. Isolation of infected animals and prophylactic antibiotics are also effective in preventing leptospirosis transmission between animals. Environmental control and sanitation also reduce transmission rates.", "leptospirosis, also called pea picker’s disease or swineherd’s disease, acute systemic illness of animals, occasionally communicable to humans, that is characterized by extensive inflammation of the blood vessels. It is caused by a spirochete, or spiral-shaped bacterium, of the genus Leptospira. Leptospires infect most mammals, particularly rodents and certain domestic animals. These animals excrete live, fully virulent organisms in their urine and contaminate the environment. Outside the animal body, leptospires can live for several weeks in fresh water. Thus, infection takes place by direct contact with urine of infected animals or by indirect contact with contaminated food or water. Leptospires can readily penetrate mucous membranes but probably cannot gain entrance to the body through intact skin. A scratch or abrasion, as well as the nasal mucosa and eye, are excellent portals of entry; thus, the origin of many infections can be traced to wading, swimming, or other contact with water containing virulent leptospires. The incidence in humans depends upon the opportunity for exposure in swimming, the harvesting of rice, and contact with animals.\nleptospirosis\nUsually after an incubation period of about a week, the first symptoms to arise in humans are the abrupt onset of fever, chills, muscle aches, headache, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Another characteristic symptom is congestion of the conjunctival blood vessels around the corneas of the eyes. After a latent period of five to seven days, during which the infected person may improve, fever returns and the infection may involve the brain. In a less-common, but more-severe, form of the illness known as Weil disease or icteric (associated with jaundice) leptospirosis, the infected person turns yellow as a result of the destruction of red blood cells and liver disease. The death rate is approximately 30 percent of the severely ill and jaundiced patients.\nDiagnosis is established by identification of the causative organism in urine or blood and by blood cultures on special media. Antibiotic therapy is effective only if given within four days of the onset of the illness. Supportive care and the maintenance of fluid balance are needed because dehydration, cardiovascular collapse, and acute kidney failure can all occur."], "selected_questions": ["How is leptospirosis transmitted to humans, and how can it be prevented?", "What are the laboratory tests used to diagnose leptospirosis, and what are the criteria for its diagnosis?", "What are the signs and symptoms of leptospirosis and what is the incubation period?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Leptospirosis is transmitted to humans through contact with water or moist soil that contains urine from infected animals.

{"name": "Love in the Time of Cholera", "documents": ["# Love in the Time of Cholera\nLove in the Time of Cholera (Spanish: El amor en los tiempos del cólera) is a novel written in Spanish by Colombian Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel García Márquez and published in 1985. Edith Grossman's English translation was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1988.\n## Plot summary\nThe main characters of the novel are Florentino Ariza and Fermina Daza. Florentino and Fermina fall in love in their youth. A secret relationship blossoms between the two with the help of Fermina's Aunt Escolástica. They exchange love letters. But once Fermina's father, Lorenzo Daza, finds out about the two, he forces his daughter to stop seeing Florentino immediately. When she refuses, he and his daughter move in with his deceased wife's family in another city. Regardless of the distance, Fermina and Florentino continue to communicate via telegraph. Upon her return, Fermina realizes that her relationship with Florentino was nothing but a dream since they are practically strangers; she breaks off her engagement to Florentino and returns all his letters.\nA young and accomplished national hero, Dr. Juvenal Urbino, meets Fermina and begins to court her. Despite her initial dislike of Urbino, Fermina gives in to her father's persuasion and the security and wealth Urbino offers, and they wed. Urbino is a physician devoted to science, modernity, and \"order and progress\". He is committed to the eradication of cholera and to the promotion of public works. He is a rational man whose life is organized precisely and who greatly values his importance and reputation in society. He is a herald of progress and modernization.\nEven after Fermina's engagement and marriage, Florentino swore to stay faithful and wait for her; but his promiscuity gets the better of him and he has hundreds of affairs. Even with all the women he is with, he makes sure that Fermina will never find out. Meanwhile, Fermina and Urbino grow old together, going through happy years and unhappy ones and experiencing all the reality of marriage. Urbino proves in the end not to have been an entirely faithful husband, confessing one affair to Fermina many years into their marriage. Though the novel seems to suggest that Urbino's love for Fermina was never as spiritually chaste as Florentino's was, it also complicates Florentino's devotion by cataloging his many trysts as well as a few potentially genuine loves.\nAs an elderly man, Urbino attempts to get his pet parrot out of his mango tree, only to fall off the ladder he was standing on and die. After the funeral Florentino proclaims his love for Fermina once again and tells her he has stayed faithful to her all these years. Hesitant at first because she is only recently widowed, and finding his advances untoward, Fermina comes to recognize Florentino's wisdom and maturity, eventually gives him a second chance, and their love is allowed to blossom during their old age. They go on a steamship cruise up the river together.\n## Characters\nFermina Daza – Florentino Ariza‘s object of affection and wife of Dr. Urbino, very beautiful and intelligent. Dr. Juvenal Urbino – highly respected, wealthy doctor and husband of Fermina Daza. Florentino Ariza – businessman who is in love with Fermina Daza. Lorenzo Daza – Fermina Daza's father, a mule driver; he despised Florentino and forced him to stop meeting Fermina. He is revealed to have been involved in some illicit businesses to build his fortune. Jeremiah de Saint-Amour – The man whose suicide is introduced as the opening to the novel; a photographer and chess-player. Aunt Escolástica – The woman who attempts to aid Fermina in her early romance with Florentino by delivering their letters for them. She is ultimately sent away by Lorenzo Daza for this. Tránsito Ariza – Florentino's mother. Hildebranda Sánchez – Fermina's cousin. Miss Barbara Lynch – The woman with whom Urbino confesses having had an affair, the only one during his long marriage. Leona Cassiani – She starts out as the \"personal assistant\" to Uncle Leo XII at the R.C.C., the company which Florentino eventually controls. At one point, it is revealed that the two share a deep respect, possibly even love, for each other, but will never actually be together. She has a maternal love for him as a result of his \"charity\" in rescuing her from the streets and giving her a job. Diego Samaritano – The captain of the riverboat on which Fermina and Florentino ride at the end of the novel. América Vicuña – The 14-year-old girl who toward the end of the novel is sent to live with the elderly Florentino; he is her guardian while she is in school. They have a sexual relationship, and after being rejected by Florentino and failing her exams, she kills herself. Her grooming and subsequent suicide provides a counterpoint to the novel's grand romantic themes.\n## Setting\nThe story occurs mainly in an unnamed port city somewhere near the Caribbean Sea and the Magdalena River in Colombia. While the city remains unnamed throughout the novel, descriptions and names of places suggest it is based on an amalgam of Cartagena and the nearby city of Barranquilla. The fictional city is divided into such sections as \"The District of the Viceroys\" and \"The Arcade of the Scribes.\" The novel takes place approximately between 1880 and the early 1930s. The city's \"steamy and sleepy streets, rat-infested sewers, old slave quarter, decaying colonial architecture, and multifarious inhabitants\" are mentioned variously in the text and mingle in the lives of the characters.\n## Major themes\n### Narrative as seduction\nSome critics choose to consider Love in the Time of Cholera as a sentimental story about the enduring power of true love. Others criticize this opinion as being too simple.\nThis is manifested by Ariza's excessively romantic attitude toward life, and his gullibility in trying to retrieve the sunken treasure of a shipwreck. It is also made evident by the fact that society in the story believes that Fermina and Juvenal Urbino are perfectly happy in their marriage, while the reality of the situation is not so ideal. Critic Keith Booker compares Ariza's position to that of Humbert Humbert in Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita, saying that just as Humbert is able to charm the reader into sympathizing with his situation with his first-person account, even though he is a \"pervert, a rapist, and a murderer,\" Ariza is able to garner the reader's sympathy, even though the reader is reminded repeatedly of his more sinister exploits through the charming third-person narration.\n### Relationship between love and passion\nThe term cholera as it is used in Spanish, cólera, can also denote passion or human rage and ire in its feminine form. (The English adjective choleric has the same meaning.) Considering this meaning, the title is a pun: cholera as the disease, and cholera as passion, which raises the central question of the book: is love helped or hindered by extreme passion? The two men can be contrasted as the extremes of passion: one having too much, one too little; the central question of which is more conducive to love and happiness becomes the specific, personal choice that Fermina faces through her life. Florentino's passionate pursuit of nearly countless women stands in contrast to Urbino's clinical discussion of male anatomy on their wedding night. Urbino's eradication of cholera in the town takes on the additional symbolic meaning of ridding Fermina's life of rage, but also the passion. It is this second meaning to the title that manifests itself in Florentino's hatred for Urbino's marriage to Fermina, as well as in the social strife and warfare that serves as a backdrop to the entire story.\n### Aging and death\nJeremiah Saint-Amour's death inspires Urbino to meditate on his own death, and especially on the infirmities that precede it. It is necessary for Fermina and Florentino to transcend not only the difficulties of love but also the societal opinion that love is a young person's prerogative (not to mention the physical difficulties of love when one is older).\n## Critical reception\nThe novel received critical acclaim. The literary critic Michiko Kakutani praised the book in a review for The New York Times. According to Katukani, \"Instead of using myths and dreams to illuminate the imaginative life of a people as he's done so often in the past, Mr. Garcia Marquez has revealed how the extraordinary is contained in the ordinary ... The result is a rich, commodious novel, a novel whose narrative power is matched only by its generosity of vision.\" The writer Thomas Pynchon, also for the New York Times, argued that \"This novel is also revolutionary in daring to suggest that vows of love made under a presumption of immortality – youthful idiocy, to some – may yet be honored, much later in life when we ought to know better, in the face of the undeniable. ... There is nothing I have read quite like this astonishing final chapter, symphonic, sure in its dynamics and tempo, moving like a riverboat too ... at the very best it results in works that can even return our worn souls to us, among which most certainly belongs Love in the Time of Cholera, this shining and heartbreaking novel.\"\n## Film adaptation\nStone Village Pictures bought the movie rights from the author for US$3 million, and Mike Newell was chosen to direct it, with Ronald Harwood writing the script. Filming started in Cartagena, Colombia, during September 2006.\nThe $50 million film, the first major foreign production filmed in the scenic walled city in twenty years, was released on November 16, 2007, by New Line Cinema. On his own initiative, García Márquez persuaded singer Shakira, who is from the nearby city of Barranquilla, to provide two songs for the film.\n## References in popular culture\nIn the film High Fidelity, the main character, Rob (played by John Cusack) owns a record store. While recounting tales of past lovers he says \"I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but I'm certainly not the dumbest. I mean, I've read books like The Unbearable Lightness of Being and Love in the Time of Cholera, and I think I've understood them. They're about girls, right? Just kidding.\"\nAt the end of Jeanine Cummins' novel American Dirt, the protagonist Lydia re-reads Amor en los tiempos del colera, first in Spanish, then again in English. The final two sentences of the novel reference the protagonist's love of the book: \"No one can take this from her. This book is hers alone.\"\nIn the British sitcom Bad Education, the text is used in the after school book club Rosie Gulliver attends, and Alfie Wickers decides to join them to impress Rosie and attempts to read the book in 6 hours. However, he finds the book boring and gets his class to read one chapter each and bring him their versions of the summary.\nIn the episode \"Milk\" of the first season of the American sitcom How I Met Your Mother, the novel is mentioned as being the favorite of the show's protagonist, Ted Mosby. He is also shown reading the book at the Farhamptom Train Station right before he meets the titular Mother in the finale episode \"Last Forever\".\nIn \"Lisa's Rival\" (The Simpsons' second episode of season 6), Marge Simpson is seen reading Love in the Time of Scurvy, a clear reference to the novel.\nIn the Gossip Girl episode \"New Haven Can Wait\" (season 2, episode 6), Jordan, a Literature professor at Yale, asks Nate what he thinks of the book. However, he has never read it and clearly doesn't understand the reference.\nIn the film Playing It Cool, Topher Grace plays the character Scott. Scott is a writer and is deeply moved by the book so much that he often leaves copies of the book in public places for others to find and read. He leaves a note in the book for the assumed reader explaining how this book changed his life. Chris Evans, the main character/narrator, finally picks up the book to read. After reading the book, the narrator applies it to his own life. He says that there are people in our lives that are so important, they dwarf everything else.\nIn the Chris Rock film Top Five, Rosario Dawson quotes the novel, saying, \"Too much love is as bad for this as no love at all\" when talking about her favorite authors.\nThe book was a major part of the plot of the movie Serendipity, where Sara writes her number in the book in the hope that Jon will one day find it.\nSales of Love in the Time of Cholera increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The title of the 2020 television show Love in the Time of Corona is a play on the title of the novel, replacing \"cholera\" with a reference to the coronavirus disease that caused the ongoing pandemic.\nMultiple musical artists have recorded songs with titles inspired by the book, including Danny Elfman (\"Love in the Time of Covid\") and AJJ (\"Love in the Time of Human Papillomavirus\").\nIn episode 4 of the 2021 Korean drama My Roommate Is a Gumiho, the male lead character Shin Woo-yeo (Jang Ki-yong) references the novel by saying, \"You could be Fermina Daza in someone's eyes\".\n## Publication details\n1985, Colombia, Spanish edition, Oveja Negra, 1985, hardback ISBN 958-06-0000-7 and paperback ISBN 958-06-0001-5 (first edition) 1985, Argentina, Spanish edition, Editorial Sudamericana, 1985, hardback ISBN 950-07-0321-1(E) (first Argentine edition) 1985, Mexico DF, Spanish edition, Editorial Diana, 1985, paperback ISBN 968-13-1547-2 (first Mexican edition: 100,000 copies) 1986, The Netherlands, Meulenhoff, ISBN 978902909048-3, translated in Dutch by Mariolein Sabarte Belacortu.

{"name": "Villanovan culture", "documents": ["Villanovan culture, Early Iron Age culture in Italy, named after the village of Villanova, near Bologna, where in 1853 the first of the characteristic cemeteries was found. The Villanovan people branched from the cremating Urnfield cultures of eastern Europe and appeared in Italy in the 10th or 9th century bc. The earliest burial rites were usually with cremation; the ashes of the dead were placed in a decorated pottery ossuary of a biconical, or two-storied, form and covered with a bowl. The lid of the urn was sometimes a pottery imitation of a helmet, either the knobbed bell helmet of eastern central Europe or the crested helmet of northern Europe, the Villanovan helmet par excellence. The Villanovans living in Tuscany also used the terra-cotta hut urn, which imitated a hut of wattle and daub on a frame of poles. The hut urn is characteristic of northern European urn fields, whereas the two-storied urn may be related to similar urns from Hungary and Romania.\nThe Villanovans controlled the rich copper and iron mines of Tuscany and were accomplished metalworkers. In the second half of the 8th century the Villanovans of Tuscany were influenced artistically by Greece; also, inhumation became the predominant burial rite, as it did during the same period in Greece.\nDuring the first quarter of the 7th century an Orientalizing civilization, presumably introduced by Etruscans, was superimposed on the Villanovan in Tuscany. The northern Villanovans of the Po Valley, however, continued to produce a geometric art as late as the last quarter of the 6th century, when Etruscan expansion obliterated their culture.", "# Villanovan culture\nThe Villanovan culture (c. 900–700 BC), regarded as the earliest phase of the Etruscan civilization, was the earliest Iron Age culture of Italy. It directly followed the Bronze Age Proto-Villanovan culture which branched off from the Urnfield culture of Central Europe. The name derives from the locality of Villanova, a fraction of the municipality of Castenaso in the Metropolitan City of Bologna where, between 1853 and 1855, Giovanni Gozzadini found the remains of a necropolis, bringing to light 193 tombs, of which there were 179 cremations and 14 inhumations.\nThe Villanovans introduced iron-working to the Italian Peninsula. They practiced cremation and buried the ashes of their dead in pottery urns of distinctive double-cone shape.\n## History\nThe name Villanovan of the early phases of the Etruscan civilization comes from the site of the first archaeological finds relating to this advanced culture, which were remnants of a cemetery found near Villanova (Castenaso, 12 kilometres south-east of Bologna) in northern Italy. The excavation lasting from 1853 to 1855 was done by the scholar and site owner, count Giovanni Gozzadini, and involved 193 tombs, six of which were separated from the rest as if to signify a special social status. The \"well tomb\" pit graves lined with stones contained funerary urns. These had been only sporadically plundered and most were untouched. In 1893, a chance discovery unearthed another distinctive Villanovan necropolis at Verucchio overlooking the Adriatic coastal plain.\nThe burial characteristics relate the Villanovan culture to the Central European Urnfield culture (c. 1300–750 BC) and Celtic Hallstatt culture that succeeded the Urnfield culture. It is not possible to tell these apart in their earlier stages. Cremated remains were placed in cinerary urns, specifically in biconical urns and then buried. The urns were a form of Villanovan pottery known as impasto. A custom believed to originate with the Villanovan culture is the usage of hut-shaped urns, which were cinerary urns fashioned like the huts in which the villagers lived. Typical sgraffito decorations of swastikas, meanders, and squares were scratched with a comb-like tool. Urns were accompanied by simple bronze fibulae, razors and rings.\n## Periodization\nThe Villanovan culture is broadly divided into Villanovan I from c. 960 BC to c. 801 BC and the Villanovan II from c. 800 BC to 720 BC. The later phase (Villanovan II) saw radical changes, evidence of contact with Hellenic civilization and trade with the north along the Amber Road. This evidence takes the form of glass and amber necklaces for women, armor and horse harness fittings of bronze, and the development of elite graves in contrast to the earlier egalitarian culture. Chamber tombs and inhumation (burial) practices were developed side-by-side with the earlier cremation practices. With the last phase of Villanovan II the Etruscans, in particular Southern Etruria, entered the Orientalizing period. The northernmost areas of the Etruscan world, such as Etruria Padana, continued in their development as Villanovan III (750–680 BC) and Villanovan IV (680–540 BC).\n## Metalwork and trade\nThe metalwork quality found in bronze and pottery demonstrate the skill of the Villanovan artisans. Some grave goods from burial sites display an even higher quality, suggesting the development of societal elites within Villanovan culture. Tools and items were placed in graves suggesting a belief in an afterlife. Men's graves contained weapons, armor, while those for women included weaving tools. A few graves switched or mixed these, indicating the possibility that some women employed tools and that some men made clothing.\nDuring the Villanovan period Etruscans traded with other states from the Mediterranean such as Greeks, Balkans, and Sardinia. Trade brought about advancement in metallurgy, and Greek presence influenced Villanovan pottery.\n## Housing\nBuildings were rectangular in shape. The people lived in small huts, made of wattle and daub with wooden poles for support. Within the huts, cooking stands, utensils and charred animal bones give evidence about the family life of early inhabitants in Italy. Some huts contained large pottery jars for food storage sunk into their floors. There was also a rock cut drain to channel rainwater to communal reservoirs.\n## Villanovan settlements\nGenerally speaking, Villanovan settlements were centered in the Adriatic Etruria, in Emilia Romagna (in particular, in Bologna and in Verucchio, near Rimini), in Marche (Fermo), and in the Tyrrhenian Etruria, in Tuscany and Lazio. Further south, Villanovan cremation burials are to be found in Campania, at Capua, at the \"princely tombs\" of Pontecagnano near Salerno, at Capo di Fiume, at Vallo di Diano and at Sala Consilina.\nSmall scattered Villanovan settlements have left few traces other than their more permanent burial sites, which were set somewhat apart from the settlements—largely because the settlement sites were built over in Etruscan times. Modern opinion generally follows Massimo Pallottino in regarding the Villanovan culture as ancestral to the Etruscan civilization.\n## Genetics\nA genetic study published in Science in November 2019 examined the remains of a female from the Villanovan culture buried in Veio Grotta Gramiccia, Italy between ca. 900 BC and 800 BC. She carried the maternal haplogroup K1a4. and her autosomal DNA was a mixture of 72.9% Copper Age ancestry (EEF + WHG) and 27.1% Steppe-related ancestry. There was evidence for consanguinity for this sample with another ancient sample (700 BCE - 600 BCE) from the Etruscan necropolis of La Mattonara near Civitavecchia, compatible with being the latter an offspring of third-degree relatives from the former."], "selected_questions": ["What kind of metalwork quality was found in bronze and pottery, suggesting the development of societal elites within Villanovan culture?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": [""], "InternLM_answers": ["The metalwork quality found in bronze and pottery suggests the development of societal elites within Villanovan culture.

{"name": "Civilian Pilot Training Program", "documents": ["# Civilian Pilot Training Program\nThe Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) was a flight training program (1938–1944) sponsored by the United States government with the stated purpose of increasing the number of civilian pilots, though having a clear impact on military preparedness.\n## Establishment\nIn the years immediately preceding World War II, several European countries, particularly Italy and Nazi Germany, began training thousands of young people to become pilots. Purportedly civilian in nature, these European government-sponsored programs were, in fact, nothing more than clandestine military flight training academies.\nIn October 1938, General Henry H. \"Hap\" Arnold brought in the top three aviation school representatives to request they establish an unfunded startup of CPTP schools at their own risk. These were Oliver Parks of Parks Air College, C. C. Moseley of the Curtiss-Wright Technical Institute, and Theophilus Lee, Jr. of the Boeing School of Aeronautics; all agreed to start work. The Civil Aeronautics Authority Act of 1938 formed the Civil Aeronautics Authority headed by Robert H. Hinckley. The act contained language authorizing and funding a trial program for what would evolve into the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP), as run by the CAA. President Franklin D. Roosevelt unveiled the program on December 27, 1938, announcing at a White House press conference that he had signed off on a proposal to provide a needed boost to general aviation by providing pilot training to 20,000 college students a year.\nFollowing the precedent established in Europe, the CPTP was established as a civilian program, but its potential for national defense was undisguised. The program started in 1939 with two laws passed by Congress in April and June, with the government paying for a 72-hour ground school course followed by 35 to 50 hours of flight instruction at facilities located near eleven colleges and universities. It was an unqualified success and provided a grand vision for its supporters – to greatly expand the nation's civilian pilot population by training thousands of college students to fly.\nA joint publication released in 1970 by the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration recounts the historical success of the CPTP, stating the program \"was planned originally as an experiment in vocational training.\" The intent was to boost industry and aviation manufacturing, with the \"added benefit to the Armed Services building a reserve of knowledgeable pilots.\" It began in 1939 with 13 colleges and 330 students, and by the summer of 1944 had grown to incorporate 1,132 educational institutions and 435,165 qualified trainees – including several hundred women, all of whom had been qualified by 1,460 contractors. Members of the CPTP became an impetus of innovation which transformed United States history, long after World War II. Their efforts proved the necessity for a radical departure from conventional thinking, when required, to preserve failing sectors of industry and become a vital adjunct to national defense.\n## Controversy\nThe military establishment was initially unenthusiastic about the CPTP concept, quite unimpressed by any program initiated and administered by civilians. Congress, too, was split along mostly party lines as to the value of the CPTP. Isolationists branded the program as provocative saber-rattling that threatened the nation's neutrality; others slammed it as a pork barrel waste of tax dollars, while supporters touted the positive impacts on the aviation industry and the defense value of a vastly enlarged base of trained pilots.\nAfter the Nazi invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, triggered World War II, the military value of the CPTP became obvious, even to the program's detractors. The United States started to evaluate its ability to fight an air war and the results were appalling. Pilots, instructors, and training aircraft were all in short supply. Acknowledging the shortage of trained pilots, both the Army Air Corps and Navy reluctantly waived certain “elimination” courses for CPTP graduates and allowed them to proceed directly into pilot training.\nThe Army Air Corps deemed the situation to be so grave it proposed that private aviation be suspended and all pilot training (most notably the CPTP) be brought under the control of the military. The December 13, 1940, issue of American Aviation Daily carried this account of the Army's intentions:\n“Preliminary plans are understood to be already drafted by the Army to ground all private flying in the United States for the duration of the national emergency...The Army will take over all training (including CPTP).”\nThe Army's proposal met with stiff resistance. Just two weeks after the American Aviation Daily article appeared, 83 companies with a vested interest in general aviation organized the National Aviation Training Association (NATA). NATA members recognized that, if left unchallenged, the Army plan would, for all practical purposes, ban private aircraft from U.S. skies. The NATA and other aviation interests blunted the Army's bid with an effective lobbying campaign in Congress. Their actions not only saved the CPTP, they may have saved the entire general aviation industry in the United States.\n## Buildup\nThe result was a revitalized CPTP and an expansion of its curriculum to a larger segment of the nation's colleges and universities. In May 1939 the first nine schools were selected, nine more were added in August 1940 (as the Battle of Britain was raging), 11 more in March 1941, and 15 more by October 1941 – four months after the formation of the USAAF – and just two months before the United States' entry into World War II. By the program's peak, 1,132 educational institutions and 1,460 flight schools were participating in the CPTP. Institutions such as the University of Michigan; University of Virginia; University of Washington; Georgia Institute of Technology; Pomona Junior College; San Jose State Teachers College; and the Tuskegee Institute, all included the CPTP in their curricula. (See References below to access complete list of educational institutions participating in the CPTP.)\nThe inclusion of Tuskegee University in the ranks of CPTP participants, along with Hampton University, Virginia State University, Delaware State University, and Howard University, helped open the doors for the first African-American military pilots. The onset of World War II and political pressure combined to compel the U.S. Army Air Corps – as it was known before June 20, 1941 – to employ African-Americans as officers and pilots, with the majority of its personnel being graduates of the CPTP.\nThe decision to train civilian pilots also produced an unexpected, but welcome, side effect on the general aviation industry. As it turned out, the United States faced just as large a shortage of training aircraft as it did civilian pilots. The federal Civil Aeronautics Authority (predecessor of the Federal Aviation Administration) regulations required a CPTP-participating flight school to own one aircraft for every ten students enrolled in the program.\nFurthermore, the requirements specified for these aircraft narrowed down the field to only several models in production at that time, with most flight schools preferring the tandem-seat configuration of the Piper Cub. Seizing the opportunity unexpectedly thrust upon them, several light aircraft manufacturers quickly filled the market void with CPTP-compatible aircraft of their own, such as the WACO UPF-7 and the Meyers OTW biplane. Aeronca and Taylorcraft also produced tandem versions of their existing side-by-side seating high-winged monoplanes, each of which would lead to their own military equivalents.\n## War Training Service\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor and the U.S. entrance into World War II, the CPTP changed forever, including the name. The Civilian Pilot Training Program became the War Training Service (WTS), or Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) War Training Service and, from 1942 to 1944, served primarily as the screening program for potential pilot candidates. Students still attended classes at colleges and universities and flight training was still conducted by private flight schools, but all WTS graduates were required to sign a contract agreeing to enter the military following graduation. There is a list of colleges and universities participating in the CPTP in '43–'44 in the appendix of \"They Flew Proud\".\nThe CPTP/WTS program was largely phased out in the summer of 1944, but not before 435,165 people, including hundreds of women and African-Americans, had been taught to fly. Notable legends trained under the CPTP include: Astronaut/Senator John Glenn, top Navy ace Alexander Vraciu, Douglas test pilot Robert Rahn, top World War II ace Major Richard Bong, triple ace Bud Anderson, former Senator George McGovern, WASP Dora Dougherty and Tuskegee airman Major Robert W. Deiz. The CPTP admirably achieved its primary mission, best expressed by the title of aviation historian Dominick Pisano's book, To Fill the Skies with Pilots.\nTwo of the largest CPT/WTS schools were Piedmont Aviation, operated by Tom Davis, and Southern Airways, operated by Frank W. Hulse. Piedmont's school was based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, while Southern had schools in Charlotte, North Carolina, Greenville and Camden, South Carolina, and in Birmingham and Decatur, Alabama. Both companies trained over 60,000 war pilots including young men from Brazil (Piedmont) and a large number of Royal Air Force pilots from England (Southern). By 1947 Davis had turned his school into Piedmont Airlines with scheduled passenger flights between North Carolina and Ohio. In 1949, Hulse had Southern Airways flying commercial service between Jacksonville, Florida and Memphis, Tennessee, and between Atlanta and Charlotte. Both airlines began operations with war surplus Douglas DC-3 aircraft that were modified for commercial service in their former CPT/WTS maintenance hangars.\nOne of the few women instructors in the CPTP later wrote about her experiences. With the threat of war rising on the horizon, Opal Kunz renewed her pilot’s license after taking a refresher course at Hagerstown, Maryland, and began teaching aviation students at the Arkansas State College (now Arkansas State University). She later moved to Rhode Island, and at the start of World War II became an instructor at the Rhode Island State Airport Terminal for Navy cadets and the government sponsored “Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP)” during the war, teaching over 400 young men how to fly for the Air Corps. This was her old dream of the Betsy Ross Air Corps come true, as she helped train the men who would fly fighter aircraft in combat. An account from the time shows the work she was doing by saying: “Mrs. Kunz has been in Providence since January  as a member of the staff of E. W. Wiggins Airways. She has a mother’s confidence in her ‘boys’ and they reciprocate with respect and enthusiasm. Nothing gives her greater joy than to see them solo, to know she has taken them one step nearer to Uncle Sam’s aerial defense line.” Later, at her home in California, she would recall her experiences with fondness. “I trained about 400 boys and it was easily the highlight of my career. I really became a sort of foster mother to them. You would be surprised how many of my boys brought their wives and children to see me after the war.” She also indicated in a letter that she had trained combat pilots. \"...I was a flight instructor all during the war. Had over three hundred students who served as combat pilots in the war.”\nSeveral CPTP graduates, including Betty Tackaberry Blake, Florence Shutsy-Reynolds and Betty Jane Williams, went on to serve as a Women Airforce Service Pilot (WASP)."], "selected_questions": ["Who are some notable individuals who trained under the CPTP?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": [""], "InternLM_answers": ["CPTP has trained many notable individuals.

{"name": "Glass melting furnace", "documents": ["# Glass melting furnace\nA glass melting furnace is designed to melt raw materials into glass.\nDepending on the intended use, there are various designs of glass melting furnaces available. They use different power sources. These sources are mainly fossil fueled or by fully electric power. A combination of both energy sources is also realized. A glass melting furnace is made from a refractory material.\n## Basics\nThe glass raw materials are fed to the glass melting tank in batches or continuously. The components (the batch) are melted to form a liquid glass melt. In addition to the basic components, the batch also contains cullet from recycled glass to save energy. The cullet content can be up to approx. 85% - 90% (green glass), depending on the requirements of the desired glass color. When changing the glass color (recoloring), the entire process often takes several days in large glass melting furnaces. For economical operation, the glass melting furnaces are operated around the clock throughout the year for so-called mass glass (hollow glass, flat glass). Apart from one to max. two smaller planned intermediate repairs, during which the furnace is taken out of operation, a so-called furnace journey (campaign) up to the general repair (rebuild) can last up to 16 years and more (depending on the product group). The capacity can range from about one ton to over 2000 tons and the daily throughput can range from a few kilograms to over 1000 tons. The operating temperature inside the furnace, above the so-called glass bath is about 1550 °C. This temperature is determined by the composition of the batch and by the required amount of molten glass - the daily production - as well as the design-related energy losses.\nGlass furnaces are operated with a flue gas heat recovery system to increase the energy efficiency.\nThe reduction in CO2 emissions required, due to the climate change mitigation, has led to various concepts to reduce or replace the use of fossil fuels, as well as to avoid the CO2 released during the melting of the batch through an increased recycling content.\n## Day tanks\nThis historical type of glass melting tank produces in batches (discontinuously); it is used to melt glasses that are only required in small quantities. The maximum melting area of day tanks is 10 m2, and the melting capacity is between 0.4 and 0.8 t/m2 of melting area.\nThe pot furnace is one type of this. The furnace consists of a refractory masonry basin with a depth of 40 to 60 cm (bottom furnace), which is covered with a vault with a diameter of 70 to 80 cm (top furnace).\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, day tanks still existed in some mouth glass works and artisan workshops, as well as in some special glass manufacturers, where small quantities of high quality glass are melted, e.g. optical glass.\nDay tanks are not taken out of service at the end of the day; the temperature is simply lowered overnight. Since the refractory material typically cannot tolerate large temperature changes and this leads to increased corrosion (consumption) of the same, such rapid cooling cannot occur anyway. If the day tank is taken out of operation, e.g. for maintenance, cooling/heating times (two to several days) must be observed which are adapted to the refractory material. Smaller furnaces (studio furnaces) in artisan studios are excepted. There, the refractory lining is designed accordingly.\n## Continuously operated glass melting furnaces\nContinuously operated furnaces consist of two sections, the melting tank and the working tank. These are separated by a passage or a constriction (float glass). In the melting tank, the batch is melted and refined. The melt then passes through the passage into the working tank and from there into the feeder (forehearth). There the glass is removed. In hollow glass production (hollow glass), the glass machine below is fed with glass gobs. In flat glass production (float glass), the glass is fed at special wide outlets as a glass ribbon over a so-called float bath of liquid tin (for flat glass without structure : e.g. window glass, car glass) or for flat glass with structure over a profiled roller.\nThe melting tanks are made of refractory materials and consist of groups of alumina (Al2O3), silica (SiO2), magnesia (MgO), Zirconia (ZrO2) as well as combinations of them to produce the necessary refractory ceramic materials. When creating glass melting furnaces (melting tank including regenerative chambers), up to 2000 t of refractory material can be used for the hollow glass sector and up to 9000 t for the flat glass sector.\nThe heat source in 2021 is typically natural gas, heavy and light oil, and electric current fed directly into the glass bath by means of electrodes. Fossil fuel heating is often combined with supplemental electric heating. Fully electrically heated glass melting tanks are also used.\nIf pure oxygen is used instead of air for the combustion of fossil fuel (preferably gas), energy savings and, in the most favorable case, lower operating costs occur. The combustion temperature and thus the heat transfer are higher, and the gas volume to be heated is lower. Oxygen-fueled glass furnaces, however, are usually not worthwhile for the production of so-called mass glass such as hollow glass and flat glass because of the expensive oxygen generation. Many different designs of glass melting furnaces are known.\nIn order to save energy in the glass melting process, in addition to using as much recycled glass as possible (approx. 2% energy savings for every 10% cullet), the heating of the combustion air to a temperature level as high as possible by means of using a regenerative or a recuperator system is a fundamental part of the process.\n## Regenerator\nIn the most commonly used regenerator, the hot exhaust gases (1300 °C - 1400 °C) are fed discontinuously in chambers through a latticework of refractory, rectangular or special shaped bricks. This so-called lattice work is heated in the process. After this warm-up period (storage of the thermal energy of the exhaust gas by the lattice), the direction of the gas flow is reversed and the fresh, cold air required for combustion now flows through the previously heated lattice work of the chamber. The combustion air is thereby preheated to approx. 1200 °C - 1300 °C. This results in considerable energy savings. After combustion, the exhaust gases in turn enter the grating of another chamber, where they reheat the now more previously cooled grating. The process is repeated periodically at intervals of 20 to 30 minutes. The chambers are thus operated discontinuously. The degree of recovery is approx. 65%\n## Recuperator\nA recuperator operates continuously and consist of a metallic heat exchanger between the exhaust gas and fresh air. Because of the metallic exchanger surface (heat-resistant high-alloy steel tubes in combination with a metallic double shell), a recuperator can only be operated at lower exhaust gas temperatures and therefore work less effectively (40%). Thus, only relatively lower preheating temperatures ( max. 800 °C) are achieved here.\nA recuperator is less expensive to install and require less space and investment. This results in cost advantages in terms of investment costs, which are, however, considerably reduced by the lower effectiveness or can even have a negative impact for a long period of operation.\nIn the case of structural restrictions for the installation of a regenerator, a combinations of regenerator and recuperator have also been developed and implemented in order to achieve the most energy-saving or efficient operation of the system possible\nAs a further measure, in order to utilize the heat content of the exhaust gas (temperature > 700 °C), a downstream heat/power coupling is technically possible or has already been tested on a large scale. However, the necessary maintenance effort of such a system is associated with considerable costs and is therefore to be evaluated as critical with regard to the associated operating costs. Therefore, this particular concept of downstream energy recovery is generally not pursued further at present. Innovative revisions of this concept must be tested in practice in the productive environment in the long term at great expense. However, this requires a certain willingness to take risks on the part of the companies, which, due to the fierce competition in this industry, is generally not taken.\n## Future development\nTriggered by the climate debate, several developments and research projects have now been launched to significantly reduce the climate-damaging CO2 in production. Among other things, an initiative has been launched in Europe to establish a new type of glass melting furnace. Various European glass manufacturers are working on this project together with technology suppliers with the aim of realizing a corresponding plant on an industrial scale. It is intended to put the plant into operation in 2022 with a melting capacity of 350 tons per day. This glass melting so called Hybrid-Furnace will be operated with 80% electricity generated from renewable energy sources and is expected to enable a reduction of CO2 by 50%.\nThe industry, a community of interest of 19 European container glass companies, tried to be supported financially by the EU Innovation Fund. However this was not successful in being awarded a grant by the EU Innovation Fund, despite the project achieving very high evaluation scores in terms of innovation, sectoral approach and scalability.\nAlthough the involved companies volunteered to contribute financially to the project, the EU grant was still representing a significant contribution to the additional CAPEX and OPEX compared to a conventional furnace. Without the EU grant, the project could not be pursued as initially planned. However, the industry is now evaluating how to proceed with their decarbonisation efforts. In 2022 several Hybrid-Furnaces are under construction and will be commissioned.\nFurthermore, there are research projects to heat glass melting furnaces alternatively with so-called green hydrogen. The combustion of hydrogen only produces water vapor. However, the water vapor has an influence on the melting process and the glass composition as well as the properties of the glass produced. The way in which this influence can be controlled and corrected is the subject of further investigation. A large-scale industrial trial was successfully conducted in August 2021.\nHydrogen, however, has a considerably lower calorific value per cubic meter compared to natural gas. This is only about one-third of that of natural gas. This results in new requirements for gas pipelines to transport hydrogen. The currently existing natural gas network is not easily designed for this. To provide the same amount of energy, the pipelines must either be approx. 70% larger or designed for a higher pressure, or a flow rate three times higher must be realized at the same pressure. The latter measure could be applied in existing pipeline networks. However, this can lead to increased vibrations, mainly caused by the existing installations in the pipeline, which promote the formation of cracks and thus trigger major damage events in the long term. It is known that under certain conditions, 100% hydrogen brittles the material at this point, accelerating deeper crack formation. However, an initially partial admixture of hydrogen to the natural gas is possible and has already been implemented. At present, a broad scientific discussion is being held on this, as well as by pipe suppliers.\nThe alternative use of biofuel was also tested in a large-scale industrial trial. A CO2 reduction of 80% was achieved. However, the required gas quantities are not fully available for a longer period of time, so that the large-scale test was limited to 4 days."], "selected_questions": ["What are the different power sources used for glass melting furnaces?", "What materials are glass melting tanks made of?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["", ""], "InternLM_answers": ["There are four different power sources used for glass melting furnaces: natural gas, electricity, oil, and coal.

It is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee.\n## History\n### Inception\nDialysis Clinic, Inc. (DCI) was founded in 1971 by Dr. Keith Johnson.\nIn December 1970, things were beginning to take shape. Upon incorporation, the decision had to be made whether DCI would be for-profit or nonprofit. Dr. Johnson and his team unanimously decided on the non-profit status and also determined that any excess revenues generated would be used for research and education in the field of kidney disease or in other ways that would benefit people with kidney disease. Just five months later, in April 1971, Dialysis Clinic, Incorporated, was established, a location was secured for the first clinic, negotiations were held with the hospital to move the patients over to the new facility, and patients began dialyzing.\nThe first DCI clinic was housed in a 1,000 square foot, refurbished home on 21st Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1971, with DCI’s first clinic already operating, there was no Medicare funding and most patients still did not have insurance to cover the cost of treatment. Dr. Johnson and his staff asked Kentucky Fried Chicken for KFC buckets to collect donations. Then the staff placed pictures of patients on their red and white buckets. On Saturday and Sunday afternoons, the staff made their way to the busiest intersections in Nashville. On a good weekend, they could raise $10,000 to help pay for treatments, but it would only last for so long and then they would be out conducting road blocks again. In 1973, the Medicare ESRD Program began, and thousands of dialysis patients across the U.S. were able to receive treatment that was and still is paid for by that program.\n### In 2016\nIn 2016, DCI operated more than 235 dialysis clinics, not including the acute facilities within hospitals. It is the fourth largest dialysis provider in the US. DCI employed more than 5,000 people and served more than 15,000 patients across 28 states. DCI is the only leading dialysis provider to have remained under its own control since its founding. It has successfully remained non-profit and has had the lowest standard mortality rates and standard hospitalization rates among large dialysis providers for the past 13 years. DCI today operates under the mission: \"We are a Non-Profit Service Organization. The Care of the Patient is Our Reason for Existence.\"\n## DCI Donor Services\nFacilitating kidney and other organ and tissue donation was the logical next step in the vertical integration of DCI as the comprehensive care provider for those in need of organ and tissue transplants. To accomplish this purpose, DCI established DCI Donor Services (DCIDS) as an independent nonprofit company. In 2016, it operated three organ procurement organizations: Tennessee Donor Services, New Mexico Donor Services, and Sierra Donor Services, in California, and one tissue bank: DCI Donor Services Tissue Bank.\n## DCI Laboratory\nDCI Laboratory, founded in 1988 as a division of Dialysis Clinic, Inc., is a laboratory responding specifically to the needs of dialysis patients. DCI's laboratory division was established in response to nephrologists’ request for personnel and instrumentation in tune with the dialysis community. DCI Laboratory provides services and testing technologies for health care providers and their ESRD patients, including:\nClinical Chemistry Hematology Immunochemistry LAL (Endotoxin) Testing Water Analysis Dialysate and Water Cultures Dialysate Chemistries HIV Testing Serum Aluminum and Zinc On-line Data Transmission Lab Petri dishes\n## Office of Clinical Research\nDCI’s Office of Clinical Research was established in 2007 to review all studies (industry or investigator-initiated) being proposed to be conducted in DCI facilities to ensure the research is scientifically rigorous and valid and that the appropriate procedures for human protections are being followed. In 2016, the Office of Clinical Research now played a major role in facilitating multisite projects through identifying and confirming participation from the clinics and investigators that are best suited to a particular project, preparing budgets and IRB documents, orchestrating data transfers from the Medical Information System (MIS) and serving as a liaison between study Sponsors, individual investigators/research sites, and the dialysis staff."], "selected_questions": ["When was Dialysis Clinic, Inc. founded?", "Where is Dialysis Clinic, Inc. headquartered?", "What is the mission of Dialysis Clinic, Inc.?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Dialysis Clinic, Inc. was founded in 1971.", "Dialysis Clinic, Inc. is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee.", "The mission of Dialysis Clinic, Inc.

{"name": "Europeana 1914-1918", "documents": ["# Europeana 1914-1918\nEuropeana 1914–1918 is a major project to digitise and publish primary and secondary historical sources on the First World War. It is coordinated by Europeana, as part of a broader program to digitise European cultural heritage.\nThe collection is composed of three major elements. The first, also titled Europeana 1914–1918, gathers digitised memorabilia and personal stories from individuals, including a series of public workshops where material can be scanned or photographed. The second, Europeana Collections 1914–1918, is a coordinated digitisation program by ten major libraries across eight European countries. The third element, EFG1914, is a project to digitise a substantial number of wartime silent films through the European Film Gateway.\n## Background\nThe Europeana 1914–1918 project was publicly announced in 2011, as \"Europeana Collections 1914–1918: Remembering the First World War\", with the goal of digitising over 400,000 source items from thirteen institutions. The original plan called for around 425,000 digitised items from the partner institutions. This would sit alongside 27,000 items (mostly photographs from the UK and France) already in Europeana, and include around 75,000 items already digitised but not yet added to Europeana. The focus was to be on \"special collections\" – manuscripts, artwork, rare books, maps, music, etc. – with the goal that most material provided would be rare or unique. Material would be hosted by the institutions but accessible through an aggregated service, and where possible copyright issues would be resolved to ensure maximal reusability of material.\nOverall, the project was anticipated to cost around 5.4 million euro, the bulk of which was due to 3.1 million euro in staffing costs at the partner institutions and 1 million in costs for sub-contracted digitisation. (The bulk of digitisation was carried out in-house.)\nMaterial from \"Collections\" was released to the Europeana site as it was digitised and uploaded, with the first collections (newspapers from Austria and photographs/magazines from Italy) released in March 2012. The first public events to showcase these digitised collections began in 2013, continuing through release in 2014.\nThe public \"Europeana 1914–18\" project opened for online submissions and began the first public roadshow events in March 2011. These events invited members of the public to bring physical artefacts or documents to be digitised, and to record information or stories connected to them. 51 sessions were run across Europe up to December 2013. The public initiative used the Community Collection Model founded by Stuart Lee and Kate Lindsay at the University of Oxford in 2008 and used for The Great War Archive Archived 2017-12-29 at the Wayback Machine. The University of Oxford was a partner in Europeana 1914–1918, providing support in the development of the online platform and training to all institutions running roadshow events.\n## Release and reception\nThe main public-facing portal for the overall project (europeana1914-18.eu) was launched at the Berlin State Library on 29 January 2014 by Monika Grütters, the German Federal Commissioner for Culture and Media. At the time of launch, the site had around 400,000 digitised items from the partner institutions, alongside 90,000 \"personal\" items and 660 hours of film.\nPublic reaction to the collections has often highlighted individual items or small collections. For example, digitised correspondence from the British Library's India Office collections has been used to highlight the involvement of Indian soldiers, particularly on the Western Front; An early find during the public digitisation project was a postcard (right) sent by Adolf Hitler to a fellow soldier while recuperating in hospital, which attracted a great deal of media attention."], "selected_questions": ["What was the focus of the Europeana 1914-1918 project in terms of material provided?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": [""], "InternLM_answers": ["The Europeana 1914-1918 project was focused on the digitization and online availability of materials from World War I.

Drying or salting, either with dry salt or with brine, was the only widely available method of preserving fish until the 19th century. Dried fish and salted fish (or fish both dried and salted) are a staple of diets in the Caribbean, West Africa, North Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Southern China, Scandinavia, parts of Canada including Newfoundland, coastal Russia, and in the Arctic. Like other salt-cured meats, it provides preserved animal protein even in the absence of refrigeration.\n## Method\nSalting is the preservation of food with dry edible salt. It is related to pickling (preparing food with brine, i.e. salty water), and is one of the oldest methods of preserving food. Salt inhibits the growth of microorganisms by drawing water out of microbial cells through osmosis. Concentrations of salt up to 20% are required to kill most species of unwanted bacteria. Smoking, often used in the process of curing meat, adds chemicals to the surface of meat that reduce the concentration of salt required. Salting is used because most bacteria, fungi and other potentially pathogenic organisms cannot survive in a highly salty environment, due to the hypertonic nature of salt. Any living cell in such an environment will become dehydrated through osmosis and die or become temporarily inactivated.\nThe water activity, aw, in a fish is defined as the ratio of the water vapour pressure in the flesh of the fish to the vapour pressure of pure water at the same temperature and pressure. It ranges between 0 and 1, and is a parameter that measures how available the water is in the flesh of the fish. Available water is necessary for the microbial and enzymatic reactions involved in spoilage. There are a number of techniques that have been or are used to tie up the available water or remove it by reducing the aw. Traditionally, techniques such as drying, salting and smoking have been used, and have been used for thousands of years. In more recent times, freeze-drying, water binding humectants, and fully automated equipment with temperature and humidity control have been added. Often a combination of these techniques is used.\n## Gallery\nPlatforms, called fish flakes, where cod dry in the sun before being packed in salt Remains of Roman fish-salting plant at Neapolis Drying salted fish at Malpe Harbour Salt fish dip at Jakarta Ruins of the Port Eynon Salt House – seawater was boiled to extract salt for preserving fish Egyptians bringing in fish and splitting them for salting Salted dried butterfishes in Chinese Food Store at Yuen Long, Hong Kong Fish in a salt crust Fish cellars at Church Cove, England, used for pressing salted pilchards into barrels for storage and export to the continent Salt cabin, a small building where fish is salted, in Koserow, Germany Dried Fish in a market of Odisha"], "selected_questions": ["What is salted fish and how is it preserved?", "Why is salting used as a method of preserving food?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Salted fish is fish that has been cured with dry salt, preserving it for later consumption.

{"name": "Acoustic Doppler current profiler", "documents": ["# Acoustic Doppler current profiler\nAn acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) is a hydroacoustic current meter similar to a sonar, used to measure water current velocities over a depth range using the Doppler effect of sound waves scattered back from particles within the water column. The term ADCP is a generic term for all acoustic current profilers, although the abbreviation originates from an instrument series introduced by RD Instruments in the 1980s. The working frequencies range of ADCPs range from 38 kHz to several megahertz. The device used in the air for wind speed profiling using sound is known as SODAR and works with the same underlying principles.\n## Working principle\nADCPs contain piezoelectric transducers to transmit and receive sound signals. The traveling time of sound waves gives an estimate of the distance. The frequency shift of the echo is proportional to the water velocity along the acoustic path. To measure 3D velocities, at least three beams are required. In rivers, only the 2D velocity is relevant and ADCPs typically have two beams. In recent years, more functionality has been added to ADCPs (notably wave and turbulence measurements) and systems can be found with 2,3,4,5 or even 9 beams.\nFurther components of an ADCP are an electronic amplifier, a receiver, a clock to measure the traveling time, a temperature sensor, a compass to know the heading, and a pitch/roll sensor to know the orientation. An analog-to-digital converter and a digital signal processor are required to sample the returning signal in order to determine the Doppler shift. A temperature sensor is used to estimate the sound velocity at the instrument position using the seawater equation of state, and uses this to estimate scale the frequency shift to water velocities. This procedure assumes that the salinity has a preconfigured constant value. Finally, the results are saved to internal memory or output online to an external display software.\n## Processing methods\nThree common methods are used to calculate the Doppler shift and thus the water velocity along the acoustic beams. The first method uses a monochromatic transmit pulse and is referred to as \"incoherent\" or \"narrowband\". The method is robust and provides good quality mean current profiles but has limited space-time resolution. When the transmit pulse consists of coded elements that are repeated, the method is referred to as \"repeat sequence coding\" or \"broadband\". This method improves the space-time resolution by a factor of 5 (typical). Commercially, this method was protected by US patent 5615173 until 2011. The pulse-to-pulse coherent method relies on a sequence of transmit pulses where the echo from subsequent pulses are assumed not to interfere with each other. This method is only applicable for very short profiling ranges but the corresponding improvement in space time resolution is of order 1000.\n## Applications\nDepending on the mounting, one can distinguish between side-looking, downward- and upward-looking ADCPs. A bottom-mounted ADCP can measure the speed and direction of currents at equal intervals all the way to the surface. Mounted sideways on a wall or bridge piling in rivers or canals, it can measure the current profile from bank to bank. In very deep water they can be lowered on cables from the surface.\nThe primary usage is for oceanography. The instruments can also be used in rivers and canals to continuously measure the discharge.\nMounted on moorings within the water column or directly at the seabed, water current and wave studies may be performed. They can stay underwater for years at a time, the limiting factor is the lifetime of the battery pack. Depending on the nature of the deployment the instrument usually has the ability to be powered from shore, using the same umbilical cable for data communication. Deployment duration can be extended by a factor of three by substituting lithium battery packs for the standard alkaline packs.\n### Bottom tracking\nBy adjusting the window where the Doppler shift is calculated, it is possible to measure the relative velocity between the instrument and the bottom. This feature is referred to as bottom-track. The process has two parts; first identify the position of the bottom from the acoustic echo, then calculating the velocity from a window centered around the bottom position. When an ADCP is mounted on a moving ship, the bottom track velocity may be subtracted from the measured water velocity. The result is the net current profile. Bottom track provides the foundation for surveys of the water currents in coastal areas. In deep water where the acoustic signals cannot reach the bottom, the ship velocity is estimated from a more complex combination of velocity and heading information from GPS, gyro, etc.\n### Discharge measurements\nIn rivers, the ADCP is used to measure the total water transport. The method requires a vessel with an ADCP mounted over the side to cross from one bank to another while measuring continuously. Using the bottom track feature, the track of the boat as well as the cross sectional area is estimated after adjustment for left and right bank areas. The discharge can then be calculated as the dot product between the vector track and the current velocity. The method is in use by hydrographic survey organisations across the world and forms an important component in the stage-discharge curves used in many places to continuously monitor river discharge.\n### Doppler velocity log (DVL)\nFor underwater vehicles, the bottom tracking feature can be used as an important component in the navigation systems. In this case the velocity of the vehicle is combined with an initial position fix, compass or gyro heading, and data from the acceleration sensor. The sensor suite is combined (typically by use of a Kalman filter) to estimate the position of the vehicle. This may help to navigate submarines, autonomous, and remotely operated underwater vehicles.\n### Wave measurements\nSome ADCPs can be configured to measure surface wave height and direction. The wave height is estimated with a vertical beam that measures the distance to the surface using the echo from short pulses and simple peak estimation algorithms. The wave direction is found by cross correlating the along-beam velocity estimates and the wave height measurement from the vertical beam. Wave measurements are typically available for seafloor-mounted instruments but recent improvements permit the instrument to be mounted also on rotating subsurface buoys.\n### Turbulence\nADCPs with pulse-to-pulse coherent processing can estimate the velocity with the precision required to resolve small scale motion. As a consequence, it is possible to estimate turbulent parameters from properly configured ADCPs. A typical approach is to fit the along beam velocity to the Kolmogorov structure configuration and thereby estimate the dissipation rate. The application of ADCPs to turbulence measurement is possible from stationary deployments but can also be done from moving underwater structures like gliders or from subsurface buoys.\n## Advantages and disadvantages\nThe two major advantages of ADCPs is the absence of moving parts that are subject to biofouling and the remote sensing aspect, where a single, stationary instrument can measure the current profile over ranges exceeding 1000 m. These features allow for long term measurements of the ocean currents over a significant portion of the water column. Since the start in the mid-1980s, many thousand ADCPs have been used in the world oceans and the instrument has played a significant role in our understanding of the world ocean circulation.\nThe main disadvantage of the ADCPs is the loss of data close to the boundary. This mechanism, often referred to as a sidelobe interference, covers 6–12% of the water column and, for instruments looking up toward the surface, the loss of velocity information close to the surface is a real disadvantage. Cost is also a concern but is normally dwarfed by the cost of the ship required to ensure a safe and professional deployment.\nAs any acoustical instrument, the ADCP contributes to noise pollution in the ocean which may interfere with cetacean navigation and echolocation. The effect depends on the frequency and the power of the instrument but most ADCPs operate in a frequency range where noise pollution has not been identified to be a serious problem."], "selected_questions": ["What is an acoustic Doppler current profiler and what is its working principle?", "How is the bottom tracking feature of ADCPs used in the navigation systems of underwater vehicles?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["An acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) is a hydroacoustic current meter similar to a sonar, used to measure water current velocities over a depth range using the Doppler effect of sound waves scattered back from particles within the water column.

{"name": "History of African Americans in Kentucky", "documents": ["# History of African Americans in Kentucky\nBlack Kentuckians are residents of the state of Kentucky who are of African ancestry. The history of Blacks in the US state of Kentucky starts at the same time as the history of white Americans; Black Americans settled Kentucky alongside white explorers such as Daniel Boone. As of 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, African Americans make up 8.5% of Kentucky's population. Compared to the rest of the population, the African American ethnic group is the 2nd largest.\n## History\n### Arrival\nThe first white explorer of the Ohio valley, Christopher Gist, who surveyed territory along the Ohio river in 1751, was accompanied by a Black \"servant\"; they found another Black man, enslaved in an Indian village, on the Scioto River (now Ohio). Daniel Boone, on his exploratory trips to the west, also had African Americans in his groups. One of them guided him across the Blue Ridge Mountains in 1760, and a number of them were included in the group that tried to settle with him in Kentucky in 1773. In 1775, Boone led another group of settlers into Kentucky, including many Black people. They settled near present-day Richmond where they encountered several attacks by Native Americans. Blacks played an integral role in the defense of Boonesborough in 1778. Alongside the whites, African Americans fought to protect their frontier. They knew that if they fled, they could die from wild animals, Indian attacks, and starvation. Instead they stayed, enduring a life of slavery.\n### Slavery and black population\nIn 1792, Kentucky drafted up its first constitution, a close reflection of Virginia's. When it came to slavery, those who were considered slaves in Virginia were also slaves in Kentucky. In addition to the constitution, in 1798 the Kentucky legislature enforced slave codes which stated that all black people of Kentucky, free or enslaved, were inferior in status of all aspects of life. Much of their slave work was steps to improving civilization. This included clearing trees to build cabins and fences.\nThe black population grew as more people came along with their slaves. As early as 1777, Blacks made up about 10% of Kentucky residents. In 1784, Kentucky was estimated to have 4,000 Blacks. In 1790, the black population grew to 16% with 11,830 slaves and 114 freemen. Then in 1800, the population was up to 19% with 41,084 black residents. The freeman population also increased to 741 people within that decade. After 1790, the population of blacks steadily increased by 2% each decade, hitting its highest point of 24.7% in 1830. There were 165,213 slaves and 4,917 freemen. At this point, Blacks were growing faster than the white population, but soon after, there was a slow decline. This was a result of a lesser need for a large labor force as well as a law in 1833 banning the importation of slaves and southern slave trade. In 1860, Kentucky's black population was at 20% with 236,167 Blacks.\n### Mid 1800s\nMost people started settling beyond the mountains of eastern Kentucky. In almost all counties, the black population was fewer than 10%. Many Blacks settled in towns, rather than the countryside, signifying that they were laborers or household servants. The northern counties had undesirable soil, making it hard to grow crops. Slave labor in these areas made the black population grow slowly. From 1830 to 1860 the population of Blacks only grew from 7,920 to 9,982.\n### Civil War and recognitions\nFrom the start of the war, Kentucky slaves had the goal of obtaining their own freedom for the benefit of themselves and their families. Newspapers were documenting numerous slave runaways. In May of 1861, the states were fearful of slave revolts. As Northern troops arrived into Kentucky, slaveholders attempted to keep the slaves from hearing abolitionist ideas. Blacks learned about the war anyway, and how it would have an effect on slavery. They gained this information by eavesdropping on council meetings and getting literate women to read to them stories from the war.\nLarge groups of slaves were fleeing Kentucky to north of the Ohio River, in search for freedom. Other slave groups were escaping to Indiana. Despite the orders of the army in Kentucky, soldiers would let Blacks join the lines. September of 1862, reports from an Ohio soldier said that about 600 slaves entered the Union troops in Lebanon, Kentucky. Slaves realized that they had authority and protection now that they were with the army.\nIn 1865, the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified, ending slavery. Kentucky, however, did not ratify the amendment until 1976.\nIn total, there were about 25,000 African American Kentuckians who served in the United States Colored Troops (USCT) in the Civil War. This made up nearly one-third of the union soldiers in Kentucky. Besides Louisiana, Kentucky has the most black men serve in the Civil War. Enlisting into the war was delayed, but once they could, almost half were prepared and sent to Camp Nelson in Jessamine County. A monument located in Greenhill Cemetery in Frankfort is one of the few monuments that recognizes African Americans in the war. Engraved on one side is \"In Memory of the Colored Soldiers Franklin County, Kentucky Who Fought in the Civil War 1861-1865\". The rest of the sides include 142 names of African American soldiers.\n### Jim Crow era\nThe Jim Crow era was a period in history marked by racial segregation. This meant all public areas such as schools, churches, and neighborhoods were separated by race. The establishment of segregated schools in Kentucky happened in 1874. It wasn't until 1884, in the Claybrook v. Owensboro lawsuit, when legal action was taken to receive equal funding of public education. However, black schools still did not have access to the same resources as the whites. They lacked books, supplies, equipment, and even building construction. In 1896, the Plessy v. Ferguson case ruled that being separate but equal was constitutional. This led Kentucky to outlaw the integration of higher education by enforcing the Day Law. Throughout Kentucky there were measures other than school systems taking part in segregation. The Eastern State Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky segregated the mentally ill patients. There were residential segregation ordinances passed in Madisonville, Kentucky and Louisville, Kentucky, continuing the divide of whites and Blacks. Later on, in the 1950s and 1960s, civil rights movements were slowly ending the Jim Crow era.\n### Civil Rights movement (1950-1996)\nStarting from the Day Law in 1950, some universities started admitting Blacks. These include Kentucky State College, Berea College, University of Louisville, and Bellarmine University. Also in 1950, as a result of Hardinsburg hospital refusing emergency care to three black men, a black man died in the waiting-room floor. This led to a new law prohibiting the hospital license of anyone who denies emergency health care.\nIn 1954, the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka required segregation of schools to stop. The University of Kentucky finally admitted black students. There was also open admittance at Russellville, Prestonsburg, Owensboro, Waynes County, and Lexington public schools. In 1955, segregation of housing in Louisville was banned because of a suit by the NAACP. Louisville schools began integrating in 1956. However, a mob at Sturgis High School against eight black students lead governor Chandler to send the state police and National Guard to protect them from violence. Another stride was taken in 1957 when the Kentucky High School Athletic Association allowed participation of black schools in its state tournaments.\nIn 1960, a voter registration campaign to replace city officials was hosted in Louisville, followed by a rally and a speech featuring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. There were demonstrations at local businesses by the Congress on Racial Equality. Discrimination in state employment was banned by the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights. In 1961, a boycott called \"Nothing New for Easter\" was organized to stop segregation of Louisville's local businesses. Other local commissions were created to promote equality in public accommodations and teacher employment. In 1963, Governor Bert Combs even issued the Fair Service Executive Order to increase public accommodations before it got suspended.\nAlso in 1963, Harry M. Sykes and Luska Twyman of Lexington and Glasgow became the first African American city council members. Later on, Twyman became the mayor of Glasgow in 1969. The Kentucky Real Estate Commission banned the use of scare tactics to force Blacks out of integrated neighborhoods. This helped form the West End Community Council, which urged peaceful integration of Louisville neighborhoods.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed by the U.S. Congress. The public accommodation bill was not supported by the Kentucky legislature, leading to a massive march of over 10,000 people in Frankfort, Kentucky. This march featured activists Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jackie Robinson. A hunger strike was later held to force legislation to pass the bill, but it was never passed through the committee. In 1965, a conference on Civil Rights was held in Louisville to address employment and public accommodations. Finally, in 1966, the General Assembly passed the Kentucky Civil Rights Act that prohibited the issues talked about in the conference, while also passing laws against housing discrimination. Jesse Warders, the only black member of the General Assembly as well as a Louisville Republican, assisted the legislature to repeal the Day Law. Bardstown later adopted these laws.\nIn 1967, the Kentucky House of Representatives elected Mae Street Kidd. Housing ordinances to ban discrimination were passed in Kenton County, Covington, and Lexington. This was just one step in helping strengthen the ordinances against housing discrimination. In 1968, Georgia Davis Powers was elected into the Kentucky Senate, helping the General Assembly add housing discrimination to the state's Civil Rights Act. Also in 1968, there was a Louisville protest, turned violent, against police mistreatment, leading to six African American being arrested. They were charged of conspiracy of bombing the Ohio River oil refineries, but after two years of court hearings, the charges were dropped.\nLouisville's local housing law was enforced in 1970, and centers were opened to help African Americans move into their new neighborhoods. In 1975, there was cross-district busing Louisville, helping the equality of public schools, while also bringing about some racial violence. In 1976, Kidd lead a campaign, encouraging the General Assembly to ratify the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Finally, in 1996, the state fully removed poll tax and segregated schools from its constitution.\n## Notable people\n### 19th-21st century\nMuhammad Ali, professional boxer, philanthropist and activist (1942–2016) Mary E.

{"name": "Byzantine diplomacy", "documents": ["# Byzantine diplomacy\nByzantine diplomacy concerns the principles, methods, mechanisms, ideals, and techniques that the Byzantine Empire espoused and used in order to negotiate with other states and to promote the goals of its foreign policy. Dimitri Obolensky asserts that the preservation of civilization in Southern Europe was due to the skill and resourcefulness of Byzantine diplomacy, which remains one of Byzantium's lasting contributions to the history of Europe and the Middle East.\n## Challenges and goals\nAfter the fall of Rome, the key challenge to the Byzantine Empire was to maintain a set of relations between itself and its sundry neighbors, including the Persians, Georgians, Iberians, the Germanic peoples, the Bulgars, the Slavs, the Armenians, the Huns, the Avars, the Franks, the Lombards, and the Arabs, that embodied and so maintained its imperial status. All these neighbors lacked a key resource that Byzantium had taken over from Rome, namely a formalized legal structure. When they set about forging formal political institutions, they were dependent on the empire. Whereas classical writers are fond of making a sharp distinction between peace and war, for the Byzantines diplomacy was a form of war by other means. Anticipating Niccolò Machiavelli and Carl von Clausewitz, Byzantine historian John Kinnamos writes, \"Since many and various matters lead toward one end, victory, it is a matter of indifference which one uses to reach it.\" With a regular army of 120,000-140,000 men after the losses of the seventh century, the empire's security depended on activist diplomacy.\nByzantium's \"Bureau of Barbarians\" was the first foreign intelligence agency, gathering information on the empire’s rivals from every imaginable source. While on the surface a protocol office—its main duty was to ensure foreign envoys were properly cared for and received sufficient state funds for their maintenance, and it kept all the official translators—it clearly had a security function as well. On Strategy, from the 6th century, offers advice about foreign embassies: \" who are sent to us should be received honourably and generously, for everyone holds envoys in high esteem. Their attendants, however, should be kept under surveillance to keep them from obtaining any information by asking questions of our people.\"\n## Principles and methods\nByzantine diplomacy drew its neighbors into a network of international and interstate relations, controlled by the empire itself. This process revolved around treaty making. Byzantine historian Evangelos Chrysos postulates a three-layered process at work: 1) the new ruler was welcomed into the family of kings, 2) there was an assimilation of Byzantine social attitudes and values, 3) as a formalization of the second layer of the process, there were laws.\nIn order to drive this process, the Byzantines availed themselves of a number of mostly diplomatic practices. For example, embassies to Constantinople would often stay on for years. A member of other royal houses would routinely be requested to stay in Constantinople, not only as a potential hostage, but also as a useful pawn in case political conditions where he came from changed. Another key practice was to overwhelm visitors by sumptuous displays. Constantinople's riches served the state's diplomatic purposes as a means of propaganda, and as a way to impress foreigners. When Liutprand of Cremona was sent as an ambassador to the Byzantine capital, he was overwhelmed by the imperial residence, the luxurious meals, and acrobatic entertainment. Special care was taken to stimulate as many of the senses in as high degree as possible: brightly lit things to see, terrifying sounds, tasty food; even the diplomatic set-piece of having barbarians standing around the throne wearing their native gear.\nThe fact that Byzantium in its dealings with the barbarians generally preferred diplomacy to war is not surprising. For the East Romans, faced with the ever-present necessity of having to battle on two fronts — in the east against Persians, Arabs and Turks, in the north against the Slavs and the steppe nomads — knew from personal experience how expensive war is both in money and manpower. The Byzantines were skilled at using diplomacy as a weapon of war. If the Bulgars threatened, subsidies could be given to the Kievan Rus. A Rus threat could be countered by subsidies to the Patzinaks. If the Patzinaks proved troublesome, the Cumans or Uzès could be contacted. There was always someone to the enemy’s rear in a position to appreciate the emperor's largesse.\nThis strategy could be seen in practice during the Rus Prince Svyatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria in 967, during which the emperor John Tzimiskes manipulated the Rus, Bulgars, Patzinaks, Magyars, and Avars individually against each other, ultimately weakening and neutralizing such groups who were previously threats to Constantinople.\nAnother innovative principle of Byzantine diplomacy was effective interference in the internal affairs of other states. In 1282, Michael VIII sponsored a revolt in Sicily against Charles of Anjou called the Sicilian Vespers. Emperor Heraclius once intercepted a message from Persian rival Khosrau II which ordered the execution of a general. Heraclius added 400 names to the message and diverted the messenger, provoking a rebellion by those on the list. The emperor maintained a stable of pretenders to almost every foreign throne.

Justinian II returned to Constantinople in 705 and resumed his reign, but he was unable to fulfill his promise to Tervel. In response, Tervel invaded Byzantine territory and defeated the Byzantine army in battle. Justinian II was forced to agree to pay Tervel an annual tribute of gold in exchange for peace.

{"name": "Fear of crime", "documents": ["# Fear of crime\nThe fear of crime refers to the fear of being a victim of crime as opposed to the actual probability of being a victim of crime. The fear of crime, along with fear of the streets and the fear of youth, is said to have been in Western culture for \"time immemorial\". While fear of crime can be differentiated into public feelings, thoughts and behaviors about the personal risk of criminal victimization, distinctions can also be made between the tendency to see situations as fearful, the actual experience while in those situations, and broader expressions about the cultural and social significance of crime and symbols of crime in people's neighborhoods and in their daily, symbolic lives.\nImportantly, feelings, thoughts and behaviors can have a number of functional and dysfunctional effects on individual and group life, depending on actual risk and people's subjective approaches to danger. On a negative side, they can erode public health and psychological well-being; they can alter routine activities and habits; they can contribute to some places turning into 'no-go' areas via a withdrawal from community; and they can drain community cohesion, trust and neighborhood stability. Some degree of emotional response can be healthy: psychologists have long highlighted the fact that some degree of worry can be a problem-solving activity, motivating care and precaution, underlining the distinction between low-level anxieties that motivate caution and counter-productive worries that damage well-being.\nFactors influencing the fear of crime include the psychology of risk perception, circulating representations of the risk of victimization (chiefly via interpersonal communication and the mass media), public perceptions of neighborhood stability and breakdown, the influence of neighbourhood context, and broader factors where anxieties about crime express anxieties about the pace and direction of social change. There are also some wider cultural influences. For example, some have argued that modern times have left people especially sensitive to issues of safety and insecurity.\n## Affective aspects of fear of crime\nThe core aspect of fear of crime is the range of emotions that is provoked in citizens by the possibility of victimization. While people may feel angry and outraged about the extent and prospect of crime, surveys typically ask people \"who they are afraid of\" and \"how worried they are\". Underlying the answers that people give are (more often than not) two dimensions of 'fear': (a) those everyday moments of worry that transpire when one feels personally threatened; and (b) some more diffuse or 'ambient' anxiety about risk. While standard measures of worry about crime regularly show between 30% and 50% of the population of England and Wales express some kind of worry about falling victim, probing reveals that few individuals actually worry for their own safety on an everyday basis. One thus can distinguish between fear (an emotion, a feeling of alarm or dread caused by an awareness or expectation of danger) and some broader anxiety. Some people may be more willing to admit their worries and vulnerabilities than others.\n## Cognitive aspects of fear of crime\nConcern about crime can be differentiated from perceptions of the risk of personal victimization (i.e. cognitive aspects of fear of crime). Concern about crime includes public assessments of the size of the crime problem. An example of a question that could be asked is whether crime has increased, decreased or stayed the same in a certain period (and/or in a certain area, for instance the respondents own neighborhood). Between 1972 and 2001, the Gallup Poll shows that American respondents think crime has decreased. By contrast, the cognitive side of fear of crime includes public perceptions of the likelihood of falling victim, public senses of control over the possibility, and public estimations of the seriousness of the consequences of crime. People who feel especially vulnerable to victimization are likely to feel that they are especially likely to be targeted by criminals (i.e. victimization is likely), that they are unable to control the possibility (i.e. they have low self-efficacy), and that the consequences would be especially severe. Additionally, these three different components of risk perception may interact: the impact of perceived likelihood on subsequent emotional response (worry, fear, anxiety, etc.) is likely to be especially strong among those who feel that consequences are high and self-efficacy is low.\n## Behavioral aspects of fear of crime\nA third way to measure fear of crime is to ask people whether they ever avoid certain areas, protect certain objects or take preventive measures. This way, measuring fear of crime can become a relatively straightforward thing, because the questions asked tap into actual behavior and 'objective' facts, such as the amount of money spent on a burglar-alarm or extra locks. Although, some researchers such as Jesse Omoregie argue that measuring fear of crime can be problematic as there are various factors like social desirability effects, respondents downplaying or over-exaggerating their fear which can affect the reliability of data. Some degree of 'fear' might be healthy for some people, creating a 'natural defence' against crime. In short, when the risk of crime is real, a specific level of 'fear' might actually be 'functional': worry about crime might stimulate precaution which then makes people feel safer and lowers their risk of crime. The fear of crime is a very important feature in criminology.\n## The influence of public perceptions of neighborhood breakdown and stability\nPerhaps the biggest influence on fear of crime is public concern about neighbourhood disorder, social cohesion and collective efficacy. The incidence and risk of crime has become linked with perceived problems of social stability, moral consensus, and the collective informal control processes that underpin the social order of a neighborhood. Such 'day-to-day' issues ('young people hanging around', 'poor community spirit', 'low levels of trust and cohesion') produce information about risk and generate a sense of unease, insecurity and distrust in the environment (incivilities signal a lack of conventional courtesies and low-level social order in public places). Moreover, many people express through their fear of crime some broader concerns about neighbourhood breakdown, the loss of moral authority, and the crumbling of civility and social capital.\nPeople can come to different conclusions about the same social and physical environment: two individuals who live next door to each other and share the same neighbourhood can view local disorder quite differently. Why might people have different levels of tolerance or sensitivity to these potentially ambiguous cues? UK research has suggested that broader social anxieties about the pace and direction of social change may shift levels of tolerance to ambiguous stimuli in the environment. Individuals who hold more authoritarian views about law and order, and who are especially concerned about a long-term deterioration of community, may be more likely to perceive disorder in their environment (net of the actual conditions of that environment). They may also be more likely to link these physical cues to problems of social cohesion and consensus, of declining quality of social bonds and informal social control.\n## Interpersonal communication and the mass media\nHearing about events and knowing others who have been victimised are thought to raise perceptions of the risk of victimisation. This has been described as a 'crime multiplier', or processes operating in the residential environment that would 'spread' the impacts of criminal events. Such evidence exists that hearing of friends' or neighbours' victimisation increases anxiety that indirect experiences of crime may play a stronger role in anxieties about victimisation than direct experience. However, there is a cautionary note: '… many residents of a neighbourhood only know of  indirectly via channels that may inflate, deflate, or garble the picture.' A subject's criminal risk perception is exaggerated by peer-communication on crime and only moderated by the own experience.\nPublic perceptions of the risk of crime are no doubt also strongly shaped by mass media coverage. Individuals pick up from media and interpersonal communication circulating images of the criminal event - the perpetrators, victims, motive, and representations of consequential, uncontrollable, and sensational crimes. The notion of 'stimulus similarity' may be key: if the reader of a newspaper identifies with the described victim, or feels that their own neighbourhood bears resemblance to the one described, then the image of risk may be taken up, personalised and translated into personal safety concerns.\nYet the relationship between fear of crime and mass media is unclear, at least in its causal ordering. To put the dilemma in simple terms: do people fear crime because a lot of crime is being shown on television, or does television just provide footage about crimes because people fear crime and want to see what's going on? The complex nature of crime could allow the media to exploit social naivety, covering crime not only selective, but also distorting the everyday world of crime. Some say the media contribute to the climate of fear that is created, because the actual frequency of victimisation is a tiny fraction of potential crime.\nWith crime accounting for up to 25 per cent of news coverage, the quality and angle of the coverage becomes an issue. The media displays violent crime disproportionately, whilst neglecting minor crimes. The reality is violent crime has been declining in the past 10 years The profile of offenders in the media is distorted, causing misunderstanding of criminal offending.\nUnfortunately, despite an abundant literature on media effects – particularly the 'mean world' hypothesis – little work has been done into how representations, imagery and symbols of crime circulate in society, transmitted and transformed by multiple actors with a wide array of effects, only to translate into personal fears about crime. Perhaps future work will take account of the transmission mechanisms through which representations, beliefs and attitudes about societal risks are propagated in different social and cultural contexts.\n## Fear of crime as socially constructed\nFear of crime can also be understood from a social constructionist perspective. The term and concept of fear of crime did not, for example, enter the public or political lexicon until the mid-1960s. That is not to say individuals did not fear crime victimization prior to this period, clearly they did at various points in history to varying degrees. However it demonstrates that fear of crime only became part of a political economy when researchers began to measure and analyse it under the auspice of The US President's Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice which reported in 1967 Once fear of crime had a name it could be deployed as a political tactic in a law and order politics. It also became something that citizens could experience as an emotional response to the threat of victimisation. The formation of a 'fear of crime feedback loop' then allowed more citizens to be surveyed as fearful, more politicians to be able to use crime fear as a political issue, security products to be sold on the back of crime fear and so on in an ever-increasing spiral that popularised crime fear. Moreover, once citizens were seen as being motivated by concerns about crime fear of crime could be used as a responsibilising technique to activate citizens to conduct themselves or consume products in ways that reduce their vulnerability to crime victimisation. This approach to understanding fear of crime does not deny the experiences of individuals who fear crime victimisation but suggests that such experiences have to be understood as being intimately connected to broader socio-political contexts."], "selected_questions": ["What is the difference between the fear of crime and the actual probability of being a victim of crime?", "What are the two dimensions of fear that people generally express in surveys about the fear of crime?", "What are the three different components of risk perception that may interact in relation to the likelihood of falling victim to crime?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["", "", ""], "InternLM_answers": ["Fear of crime is a perception, while the probability of being a victim of crime is a statistical fact.

{"name": "Tucatinib", "documents": ["# Tucatinib\nTucatinib, sold under the brand name Tukysa, is a small molecule inhibitor of HER2 for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. It was developed by Array BioPharma and licensed to Cascadian Therapeutics (formerly Oncothyreon, subsequently part of Seattle Genetics).\nCommon side effects are diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (burning or tingling discomfort in the hands and feet), nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), vomiting, stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth and lips), decreased appetite, abdominal pain, headache, anemia and rash. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not take Tucatinib because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby.\nTucatinib was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2020, in Australia in August 2020, and in the European Union in February 2021.\n## Medical uses\nTucatinib is a kinase inhibitor indicated in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for the treatment of adults with advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, including those with brain metastases, who have received one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.\nIn the European Union, it is indicated in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for the treatment of adults with HER2‑positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have received at least two prior anti‑HER2 treatment regimens.\n## Clinical trials\nTwo early stage clinical trials have reported encouraging results, both of which had options to enroll subjects with central nervous system (CNS) metastases. HER2CLIMB is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine in patients with pretreated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.\n## History\nIn April 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tucatinib in combination with chemotherapy (trastuzumab and capecitabine) for the treatment of adults with advanced forms of HER2-positive breast cancer that can't be removed with surgery, or has spread to other parts of the body, including the brain, and who have received one or more prior treatments.\nThe FDA collaborated with the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Health Canada, Health Sciences Authority (HSA, Singapore) and Swissmedic (SMC, Switzerland) on the review. This was the first Project Orbis partnership between the FDA, HSA and Swissmedic. As of 17 April 2020, the application is still under review at the other agencies.\nTucatinib is a kinase inhibitor meaning it blocks a type of enzyme (kinase) and helps prevent the cancer cells from growing. Tucatinib is approved for treatment after adults have taken one or more anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. The FDA approved tucatinib based on the results of the HER2CLIMB trial (NCT02614794) enrolling 612 subjects who had HER2-positive advanced unresectable or metastatic breast cancer and had prior treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). Subjects with previously treated and stable brain metastases, as well as those with previously treated and growing or untreated brain metastases, were eligible for the clinical trial, and 48% of enrolled subjects had brain metastases at the start of the trial.\nSubjects received either tucatinib 300 mg twice daily plus trastuzumab and capecitabine (tucatinib arm, n=410) or placebo plus trastuzumab and capecitabine (control arm, n=202). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), or the amount of time when there was no growth of the tumor, assessed by a blinded independent central review, evaluated in the initial 480 randomized patients. The median PFS in subjects who received tucatinib, trastuzumab, and capecitabine was 7.8 months (95% CI: 7.5, 9.6) compared to 5.6 months (95% CI: 4.2, 7.1) in those subjects who received placebo, trastuzumab, and capecitabine (HR 0.54; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.71; p<0.00001). Overall survival and PFS in subjects with brain metastases at baseline were key secondary endpoints. The median overall survival in subjects who received tucatinib, trastuzumab, and capecitabine was 21.9 months (95% CI: 18.3, 31.0) compared to 17.4 months (95% CI: 13.6, 19.9) in subjects who received placebo, trastuzumab, and capecitabine (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.87; p=0.00480). The median PFS in subjects with brain metastases at baseline who received tucatinib, trastuzumab and capecitabine was 7.6 months (95% CI: 6.2, 9.5) compared to 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.1, 5.7) in subjects who received placebo, trastuzumab and capecitabine (HR: 0.48; 0.34, 0.69; p<0.00001).\nThe FDA granted the application for tucatinib priority review, breakthrough therapy, fast track, and orphan drug designations.

As with César Franck's Symphony in D minor, the critics were divided.\nIt was dedicated to the French painter and art collector Henry Lerolle.\n## Instrumentation\nThe score calls for 2 flutes, piccolo, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets in B flat, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, 3 timpani, 2 harps and strings.\n## Structure\nThe symphony follows the 3-movement form as established by Chausson's teacher and mentor César Franck, it also employs the cyclic form of recurring themes.\nI. Lent-Allegro vivo II. Très Lent III. Animé\nThe first movement follows a personal adaptation of sonata-form, dividing the development section into several sections, with a highly dramatic slow introduction, introducing the solemn main theme of the symphony. It slowly builds to an anguished climax only to be followed by a very swift and light-hearted allegro vivo in the key of B-flat major. The second subject is more relaxed and harmonised in chromatic-impressionistic chords. After a sudden heightening tension the Allegro Vivo theme is restated and the movement closes triumphantly.\nThe second movement is an A-B-A' structure and brings in mind Chausson's songs. It begins darkly in the key of D minor. The second subject, in B flat, is more optimistic. This builds up in a double climax, the second being a rather bold restatement of the first subject. The movement ends in D major. The third movement is a rondo structure supplemented by an epilogue, not unlike the finale in Franck's Symphony in D minor. The beginning is rather tempestuous, expressed in swift 16th figures alternating inexorably between strings and woodwind. The second theme is a brass chorale, reminiscent of Franck. The conclusion of the symphony is undoubtedly the most moving of all with the theme of the first movement stealing in and fading away in the end.\nThe Symphony takes Franck's concept of three-movement pattern with cyclic form one step further, making the form more dramatic and compressing symphonic form, a task taken to its extremes by Jean Sibelius. Harmonically it takes Franck's chromaticism towards something more impressionistic.\nAnother curious parallel with the Franck Symphony is the key relationships between the movements.\nFranck.

{"name": "Intelligent tutoring system", "documents": ["# Intelligent tutoring system\nAn intelligent tutoring system (ITS) is a computer system that aims to provide immediate and customized instruction or feedback to learners, usually without requiring intervention from a human teacher. ITSs have the common goal of enabling learning in a meaningful and effective manner by using a variety of computing technologies. There are many examples of ITSs being used in both formal education and professional settings in which they have demonstrated their capabilities and limitations. There is a close relationship between intelligent tutoring, cognitive learning theories and design; and there is ongoing research to improve the effectiveness of ITS. An ITS typically aims to replicate the demonstrated benefits of one-to-one, personalized tutoring, in contexts where students would otherwise have access to one-to-many instruction from a single teacher (e.g., classroom lectures), or no teacher at all (e.g., online homework). ITSs are often designed with the goal of providing access to high quality education to each and every student.\n## History\n### Early mechanical systems\nThe possibility of intelligent machines has been discussed for centuries. Blaise Pascal created the first calculating machine capable of mathematical functions in the 17th century simply called Pascal's Calculator. At this time the mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz envisioned machines capable of reasoning and applying rules of logic to settle disputes. These early works inspired later developments.\nThe concept of intelligent machines for instructional use date back as early as 1924, when Sidney Pressey of Ohio State University created a mechanical teaching machine to instruct students without a human teacher. His machine resembled closely a typewriter with several keys and a window that provided the learner with questions. The Pressey Machine allowed user input and provided immediate feedback by recording their score on a counter.\nPressey was influenced by Edward L. Thorndike, a learning theorist and educational psychologist at the Columbia University Teachers' College of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Thorndike posited laws for maximizing learning. Thorndike's laws included the law of effect, the law of exercise, and the law of recency. By later standards, Pressey's teaching and testing machine would not be considered intelligent as it was mechanically run and was based on one question and answer at a time, but it set an early precedent for future projects.\nBy the 1950s and 1960s, new perspectives on learning were emerging. Burrhus Frederic \"B.F.\" Skinner at Harvard University did not agree with Thorndike's learning theory of connectionism or Pressey's teaching machine. Rather, Skinner was a behaviorist who believed that learners should construct their answers and not rely on recognition. He too, constructed a teaching machine with an incremental mechanical system that would reward students for correct responses to questions.\n### Early electronic systems\nIn the period following the second world war, mechanical binary systems gave way to binary based electronic machines. These machines were considered intelligent when compared to their mechanical counterparts as they had the capacity to make logical decisions. However, the study of defining and recognizing a machine intelligence was still in its infancy.\nAlan Turing, a mathematician, logician and computer scientist, linked computing systems to thinking. One of his most notable papers outlined a hypothetical test to assess the intelligence of a machine which came to be known as the Turing test. Essentially, the test would have a person communicate with two other agents, a human and a computer asking questions to both recipients. The computer passes the test if it can respond in such a way that the human posing the questions cannot differentiate between the other human and the computer. The Turing test has been used in its essence for more than two decades as a model for current ITS development. The main ideal for ITS systems is to effectively communicate. As early as the 1950s programs were emerging displaying intelligent features. Turing's work as well as later projects by researchers such as Allen Newell, Clifford Shaw, and Herb Simon showed programs capable of creating logical proofs and theorems. Their program, The Logic Theorist exhibited complex symbol manipulation and even generation of new information without direct human control and is considered by some to be the first AI program. Such breakthroughs would inspire the new field of Artificial Intelligence officially named in 1956 by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference. This conference was the first of its kind that was devoted to scientists and research in the field of AI.\nThe latter part of the 1960s and 1970s saw many new CAI (Computer-Assisted instruction) projects that built on advances in computer science. The creation of the ALGOL programming language in 1958 enabled many schools and universities to begin developing Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) programs. Major computer vendors and federal agencies in the US such as IBM, HP, and the National Science Foundation funded the development of these projects. Early implementations in education focused on programmed instruction (PI), a structure based on a computerized input-output system. Although many supported this form of instruction, there was limited evidence supporting its effectiveness. The programming language LOGO was created in 1967 by Wally Feurzeig, Cynthia Solomon, and Seymour Papert as a language streamlined for education. PLATO, an educational terminal featuring displays, animations, and touch controls that could store and deliver large amounts of course material, was developed by Donald Bitzer in the University of Illinois in the early 1970s. Along with these, many other CAI projects were initiated in many countries including the US, the UK, and Canada.\nAt the same time that CAI was gaining interest, Jaime Carbonell suggested that computers could act as a teacher rather than just a tool (Carbonell, 1970). A new perspective would emerge that focused on the use of computers to intelligently coach students called Intelligent Computer Assisted Instruction or Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Where CAI used a behaviourist perspective on learning based on Skinner's theories (Dede & Swigger, 1988), ITS drew from work in cognitive psychology, computer science, and especially artificial intelligence. There was a shift in AI research at this time as systems moved from the logic focus of the previous decade to knowledge based systems—systems could make intelligent decisions based on prior knowledge (Buchanan, 2006). Such a program was created by Seymour Papert and Ira Goldstein who created Dendral, a system that predicted possible chemical structures from existing data. Further work began to showcase analogical reasoning and language processing. These changes with a focus on knowledge had big implications for how computers could be used in instruction. The technical requirements of ITS, however, proved to be higher and more complex than CAI systems and ITS systems would find limited success at this time.\nTowards the latter part of the 1970s interest in CAI technologies began to wane. Computers were still expensive and not as available as expected. Developers and instructors were reacting negatively to the high cost of developing CAI programs, the inadequate provision for instructor training, and the lack of resources.\n### Microcomputers and intelligent systems\nThe microcomputer revolution in the late 1970s and early 1980s helped to revive CAI development and jumpstart development of ITS systems. Personal computers such as the Apple 2, Commodore PET, and TRS-80 reduced the resources required to own computers and by 1981, 50% of US schools were using computers (Chambers & Sprecher, 1983). Several CAI projects utilized the Apple 2 as a system to deliver CAI programs in high schools and universities including the British Columbia Project and California State University Project in 1981.\nThe early 1980s would also see Intelligent Computer-Assisted Instruction (ICAI) and ITS goals diverge from their roots in CAI. As CAI became increasingly focused on deeper interactions with content created for a specific area of interest, ITS sought to create systems that focused on knowledge of the task and the ability to generalize that knowledge in non-specific ways (Larkin & Chabay, 1992). The key goals set out for ITS were to be able to teach a task as well as perform it, adapting dynamically to its situation. In the transition from CAI to ICAI systems, the computer would have to distinguish not only between the correct and incorrect response but the type of incorrect response to adjust the type of instruction. Research in Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Psychology fueled the new principles of ITS. Psychologists considered how a computer could solve problems and perform 'intelligent' activities. An ITS programme would have to be able to represent, store and retrieve knowledge and even search its own database to derive its own new knowledge to respond to learner's questions. Basically, early specifications for ITS or (ICAI) require it to \"diagnose errors and tailor remediation based on the diagnosis\" (Shute & Psotka, 1994, p. 9). The idea of diagnosis and remediation is still in use today when programming ITS.\nA key breakthrough in ITS research was the creation of The LISP Tutor, a program that implemented ITS principles in a practical way and showed promising effects increasing student performance. The LISP Tutor was developed and researched in 1983 as an ITS system for teaching students the LISP programming language (Corbett & Anderson, 1992). The LISP Tutor could identify mistakes and provide constructive feedback to students while they were performing the exercise. The system was found to decrease the time required to complete the exercises while improving student test scores (Corbett & Anderson, 1992). Other ITS systems beginning to develop around this time include TUTOR created by Logica in 1984 as a general instructional tool and PARNASSUS created in Carnegie Mellon University in 1989 for language instruction.\n### Modern ITS\nAfter the implementation of initial ITS, more researchers created a number of ITS for different students. In the late 20th century, Intelligent Tutoring Tools (ITTs) was developed by the Byzantium project, which involved six universities. The ITTs were general purpose tutoring system builders and many institutions had positive feedback while using them. (Kinshuk, 1996) This builder, ITT, would produce an Intelligent Tutoring Applet (ITA) for different subject areas. Different teachers created the ITAs and built up a large inventory of knowledge that was accessible by others through the Internet. Once an ITS was created, teachers could copy it and modify it for future use. This system was efficient and flexible. However, Kinshuk and Patel believed that the ITS was not designed from an educational point of view and was not developed based on the actual needs of students and teachers (Kinshuk and Patel, 1997). Recent work has employed ethnographic and design research methods to examine the ways ITSs are actually used by students and teachers across a range of contexts, often revealing unanticipated needs that they meet, fail to meet, or in some cases, even create.\nModern day ITSs typically try to replicate the role of a teacher or a teaching assistant, and increasingly automate pedagogical functions such as problem generation, problem selection, and feedback generation. However, given a current shift towards blended learning models, recent work on ITSs has begun focusing on ways these systems can effectively leverage the complementary strengths of human-led instruction from a teacher or peer, when used in co-located classrooms or other social contexts.\nThere were three ITS projects that functioned based on conversational dialogue: AutoTutor, Atlas (Freedman, 1999), and Why2. The idea behind these projects was that since students learn best by constructing knowledge themselves, the programs would begin with leading questions for the students and would give out answers as a last resort. AutoTutor's students focused on answering questions about computer technology, Atlas's students focused on solving quantitative problems, and Why2's students focused on explaining physical systems qualitatively. (Graesser, VanLehn, and others, 2001) Other similar tutoring systems such as Andes (Gertner, Conati, and VanLehn, 1998) tend to provide hints and immediate feedback for students when students have trouble answering the questions. They could guess their answers and have correct answers without deep understanding of the concepts. Research was done with a small group of students using Atlas and Andes respectively. The results showed that students using Atlas made significant improvements compared with students who used Andes. However, since the above systems require analysis of students' dialogues, improvement is yet to be made so that more complicated dialogues can be managed.\n## Structure\nIntelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) consist of four basic components based on a general consensus amongst researchers (Nwana,1990; Freedman, 2000; Nkambou et al., 2010):\nThe Domain model The Student model The Tutoring model, and The User interface model\nThe domain model (also known as the cognitive model or expert knowledge model) is built on a theory of learning, such as the ACT-R theory which tries to take into account all the possible steps required to solve a problem. More specifically, this model \"contains the concepts, rules, and problem-solving strategies of the domain to be learned. It can fulfill several roles: as a source of expert knowledge, a standard for evaluating the student's performance or for detecting errors, etc.\" (Nkambou et al., 2010, p. 4). Another approach for developing domain models is based on Stellan Ohlsson's Theory of Learning from performance errors, known as constraint-based modelling (CBM). In this case, the domain model is presented as a set of constraints on correct solutions.\nThe student model can be thought of as an overlay on the domain model. It is considered as the core component of an ITS paying special attention to student's cognitive and affective states and their evolution as the learning process advances. As the student works step-by-step through their problem solving process, an ITS engages in a process called model tracing. Anytime the student model deviates from the domain model, the system identifies, or flags, that an error has occurred. On the other hand, in constraint-based tutors the student model is represented as an overlay on the constraint set. Constraint-based tutors evaluate the student's solution against the constraint set, and identify satisfied and violated constraints. If there are any violated constraints, the student's solution is incorrect, and the ITS provides feedback on those constraints. Constraint-based tutors provide negative feedback (i.e. feedback on errors) and also positive feedback.\nThe tutor model accepts information from the domain and student models and makes choices about tutoring strategies and actions. At any point in the problem-solving process the learner may request guidance on what to do next, relative to their current location in the model. In addition, the system recognizes when the learner has deviated from the production rules of the model and provides timely feedback for the learner, resulting in a shorter period of time to reach proficiency with the targeted skills. The tutor model may contain several hundred production rules that can be said to exist in one of two states, learned or unlearned. Every time a student successfully applies a rule to a problem, the system updates a probability estimate that the student has learned the rule. The system continues to drill students on exercises that require effective application of a rule until the probability that the rule has been learned reaches at least 95% probability.\nKnowledge tracing tracks the learner's progress from problem to problem and builds a profile of strengths and weaknesses relative to the production rules. The cognitive tutoring system developed by John Anderson at Carnegie Mellon University presents information from knowledge tracing as a skillometer, a visual graph of the learner's success in each of the monitored skills related to solving algebra problems. When a learner requests a hint, or an error is flagged, the knowledge tracing data and the skillometer are updated in real-time.\nThe user interface component \"integrates three types of information that are needed in carrying out a dialogue: knowledge about patterns of interpretation (to understand a speaker) and action (to generate utterances) within dialogues; domain knowledge needed for communicating content; and knowledge needed for communicating intent\" (Padayachee, 2002, p. 3).\nNkambou et al. (2010) make mention of Nwana's (1990) review of different architectures underlining a strong link between architecture and paradigm (or philosophy). Nwana (1990) declares, \"t is almost a rarity to find two ITSs based on the same architecture  results from the experimental nature of the work in the area\" (p. 258). He further explains that differing tutoring philosophies emphasize different components of the learning process (i.e., domain, student or tutor). The architectural design of an ITS reflects this emphasis, and this leads to a variety of architectures, none of which, individually, can support all tutoring strategies (Nwana, 1990, as cited in Nkambou et al., 2010). Moreover, ITS projects may vary according to the relative level of intelligence of the components. As an example, a project highlighting intelligence in the domain model may generate solutions to complex and novel problems so that students can always have new problems to work on, but it might only have simple methods for teaching those problems, while a system that concentrates on multiple or novel ways of teaching a particular topic might find a less sophisticated representation of that content sufficient.\n## Design and development methods\nApart from the discrepancy amongst ITS architectures each emphasizing different elements, the development of an ITS is much the same as any instructional design process. Corbett et al. (1997) summarized ITS design and development as consisting of four iterative stages: (1) needs assessment, (2) cognitive task analysis, (3) initial tutor implementation and (4) evaluation.\nThe first stage known as needs assessment is common to any instructional design process, especially software development. This involves a learner analysis, consultation with subject matter experts and/or the instructor(s). This first step is part of the development of the expert/knowledge and student domain. The goal is to specify learning goals and to outline a general plan for the curriculum; it is imperative not to computerize traditional concepts but develop a new curriculum structure by defining the task in general and understanding learners' possible behaviours dealing with the task and to a lesser degree the tutor's behavior. In doing so, three crucial dimensions need to be dealt with: (1) the probability a student is able to solve problems; (2) the time it takes to reach this performance level and (3) the probability the student will actively use this knowledge in the future. Another important aspect that requires analysis is cost effectiveness of the interface. Moreover, teachers and student entry characteristics such as prior knowledge must be assessed since both groups are going to be system users.\nThe second stage, cognitive task analysis, is a detailed approach to expert systems programming with the goal of developing a valid computational model of the required problem solving knowledge. Chief methods for developing a domain model include: (1) interviewing domain experts, (2) conducting \"think aloud\" protocol studies with domain experts, (3) conducting \"think aloud\" studies with novices and (4) observation of teaching and learning behavior. Although the first method is most commonly used, experts are usually incapable of reporting cognitive components. The \"think aloud\" methods, in which the experts is asked to report aloud what s/he is thinking when solving typical problems, can avoid this problem. Observation of actual online interactions between tutors and students provides information related to the processes used in problem-solving, which is useful for building dialogue or interactivity into tutoring systems.\nThe third stage, initial tutor implementation, involves setting up a problem solving environment to enable and support an authentic learning process. This stage is followed by a series of evaluation activities as the final stage which is again similar to any software development project.\nThe fourth stage, evaluation includes (1) pilot studies to confirm basic usability and educational impact; (2) formative evaluations of the system under development, including (3) parametric studies that examine the effectiveness of system features and finally, (4) summative evaluations of the final tutor's effect: learning rate and asymptotic achievement levels.\nA variety of authoring tools have been developed to support this process and create intelligent tutors, including ASPIRE, the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT), GIFT, ASSISTments Builder and AutoTutor tools. The goal of most of these authoring tools is to simplify the tutor development process, making it possible for people with less expertise than professional AI programmers to develop Intelligent Tutoring Systems.\nEight principles of ITS design and development\nAnderson et al. (1987) outlined eight principles for intelligent tutor design and Corbett et al. (1997) later elaborated on those principles highlighting an all-embracing principle which they believed governed intelligent tutor design, they referred to this principle as:\nPrinciple 0: An intelligent tutor system should enable the student to work to the successful conclusion of problem solving.\nRepresent student competence as a production set. Communicate the goal structure underlying the problem solving. Provide instruction in the problem solving context. Promote an abstract understanding of the problem-solving knowledge. Minimize working memory load. Provide immediate feedback on errors. Adjust the grain size of instruction with learning. Facilitate successive approximations to the target skill.\n## Use in practice\nAll this is a substantial amount of work, even if authoring tools have become available to ease the task. This means that building an ITS is an option only in situations in which they, in spite of their relatively high development costs, still reduce the overall costs through reducing the need for human instructors or sufficiently boosting overall productivity. Such situations occur when large groups need to be tutored simultaneously or many replicated tutoring efforts are needed. Cases in point are technical training situations such as training of military recruits and high school mathematics. One specific type of intelligent tutoring system, the Cognitive Tutor, has been incorporated into mathematics curricula in a substantial number of United States high schools, producing improved student learning outcomes on final exams and standardized tests. Intelligent tutoring systems have been constructed to help students learn geography, circuits, medical diagnosis, computer programming, mathematics, physics, genetics, chemistry, etc. Intelligent Language Tutoring Systems (ILTS), e.g. this one, teach natural language to first or second language learners. ILTS requires specialized natural language processing tools such as large dictionaries and morphological and grammatical analyzers with acceptable coverage.\n## Applications\nDuring the rapid expansion of the web boom, new computer-aided instruction paradigms, such as e-learning and distributed learning, provided an excellent platform for ITS ideas. Areas that have used ITS include natural language processing, machine learning, planning, multi-agent systems, ontologies, Semantic Web, and social and emotional computing. In addition, other technologies such as multimedia, object-oriented systems, modeling, simulation, and statistics have also been connected to or combined with ITS. Historically non-technological areas such as the educational sciences and psychology have also been influenced by the success of ITS.\nIn recent years, ITS has begun to move away from the search-based to include a range of practical applications. ITS have expanded across many critical and complex cognitive domains, and the results have been far reaching. ITS systems have cemented a place within formal education and these systems have found homes in the sphere of corporate training and organizational learning. ITS offers learners several affordances such as individualized learning, just in time feedback, and flexibility in time and space.\nWhile Intelligent tutoring systems evolved from research in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence, there are now many applications found in education and in organizations. Intelligent tutoring systems can be found in online environments or in a traditional classroom computer lab, and are used in K-12 classrooms as well as in universities. There are a number of programs that target mathematics but applications can be found in health sciences, language acquisition, and other areas of formalized learning.\nReports of improvement in student comprehension, engagement, attitude, motivation, and academic results have all contributed to the ongoing interest in the investment in and research of theses systems. The personalized nature of the intelligent tutoring systems affords educators the opportunity to create individualized programs. Within education there are a plethora of intelligent tutoring systems, an exhaustive list does not exist but several of the more influential programs are listed below.\n### Education\nAlgebra Tutor PAT (PUMP Algebra Tutor or Practical Algebra Tutor) developed by the Pittsburgh Advanced Cognitive Tutor Center at Carnegie Mellon University, engages students in anchored learning problems and uses modern algebraic tools in order to engage students in problem solving and in sharing of their results. The aim of PAT is to tap into a students' prior knowledge and everyday experiences with mathematics in order to promote growth. The success of PAT is well documented (ex. Miami-Dade County Public Schools Office of Evaluation and Research) from both a statistical (student results) and emotional (student and instructor feedback) perspective.\nSQL-Tutor is the first ever constraint-based tutor developed by the Intelligent Computer Tutoring Group (ICTG) at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. SQL-Tutor teaches students how to retrieve data from databases using the SQL SELECT statement.\nEER-Tutor is a constraint-based tutor (developed by ICTG) that teaches conceptual database design using the Entity Relationship model. An earlier version of EER-Tutor was KERMIT, a stand-alone tutor for ER modelling, which was shown to results in significant improvement of student's knowledge after one hour of learning (with the effect size of 0.6).\nCOLLECT-UML is a constraint-based tutor that supports pairs of students working collaboratively on UML class diagrams. The tutor provides feedback on the domain level as well as on collaboration.\nStoichTutor is a web-based intelligent tutor that helps high school students learn chemistry, specifically the sub-area of chemistry known as stoichiometry. It has been used to explore a variety of learning science principles and techniques, such as worked examples and politeness.\nMathematics Tutor The Mathematics Tutor (Beal, Beck & Woolf, 1998) helps students solve word problems using fractions, decimals and percentages. The tutor records the success rates while a student is working on problems while providing subsequent, lever-appropriate problems for the student to work on. The subsequent problems that are selected are based on student ability and a desirable time in is estimated in which the student is to solve the problem.\neTeacher eTeacher (Schiaffino et al., 2008) is an intelligent agent or pedagogical agent, that supports personalized e-learning assistance. It builds student profiles while observing student performance in online courses. eTeacher then uses the information from the student's performance to suggest a personalized courses of action designed to assist their learning process.\nZOSMAT ZOSMAT was designed to address all the needs of a real classroom. It follows and guides a student in different stages of their learning process. This is a student-centered ITS does this by recording the progress in a student's learning and the student program changes based on the student's effort. ZOSMAT can be used for either individual learning or in a real classroom environment alongside the guidance of a human tutor.\nREALP REALP was designed to help students enhance their reading comprehension by providing reader-specific lexical practice and offering personalized practice with useful, authentic reading materials gathered from the Web. The system automatically build a user model according to student's performance. After reading, the student is given a series of exercises based on the target vocabulary found in reading.\nCIRCSlM-Tutor CIRCSIM_Tutor is an intelligent tutoring system that is used with first year medical students at the Illinois Institute of Technology. It uses natural dialogue based, Socratic language to help students learn about regulating blood pressure.\nWhy2-Atlas Why2-Atlas is an ITS that analyses students explanations of physics principles. The students input their work in paragraph form and the program converts their words into a proof by making assumptions of student beliefs that are based on their explanations. In doing this, misconceptions and incomplete explanations are highlighted. The system then addresses these issues through a dialogue with the student and asks the student to correct their essay. A number of iterations may take place before the process is complete.\nSmartTutor The University of Hong Kong (HKU) developed a SmartTutor to support the needs of continuing education students. Personalized learning was identified as a key need within adult education at HKU and SmartTutor aims to fill that need. SmartTutor provides support for students by combining Internet technology, educational research and artificial intelligence.\nAutoTutor AutoTutor assists college students in learning about computer hardware, operating systems and the Internet in an introductory computer literacy course by simulating the discourse patterns and pedagogical strategies of a human tutor. AutoTutor attempts to understand learner's input from the keyboard and then formulate dialog moves with feedback, prompts, correction and hints.\nActiveMath ActiveMath is a web-based, adaptive learning environment for mathematics. This system strives for improving long-distance learning, for complementing traditional classroom teaching, and for supporting individual and lifelong learning.\nESC101-ITS The Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India developed the ESC101-ITS, an intelligent tutoring system for introductory programming problems.\nAdaptErrEx is an adaptive intelligent tutor that uses interactive erroneous examples to help students learn decimal arithmetic.\n### Corporate training and industry\nGeneralized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) is an educational software designed for creation of computer-based tutoring systems. Developed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory from 2009 to 2011, GIFT was released for commercial use in May 2012. GIFT is open-source and domain independent, and can be downloaded online for free. The software allows an instructor to design a tutoring program that can cover various disciplines through adjustments to existing courses. It includes coursework tools intended for use by researchers, instructional designers, instructors, and students. GIFT is compatible with other teaching materials, such as PowerPoint presentations, which can be integrated into the program.\nSHERLOCK \"SHERLOCK\" is used to train Air Force technicians to diagnose problems in the electrical systems of F-15 jets. The ITS creates faulty schematic diagrams of systems for the trainee to locate and diagnose. The ITS provides diagnostic readings allowing the trainee to decide whether the fault lies in the circuit being tested or if it lies elsewhere in the system. Feedback and guidance are provided by the system and help is available if requested.\nCardiac Tutor The Cardiac Tutor's aim is to support advanced cardiac support techniques to medical personnel. The tutor presents cardiac problems and, using a variety of steps, students must select various interventions. Cardiac Tutor provides clues, verbal advice, and feedback in order to personalize and optimize the learning. Each simulation, regardless of whether the students were successfully able to help their patients, results in a detailed report which students then review.\nCODES Cooperative Music Prototype Design is a Web-based environment for cooperative music prototyping. It was designed to support users, especially those who are not specialists in music, in creating musical pieces in a prototyping manner. The musical examples (prototypes) can be repeatedly tested, played and modified. One of the main aspects of CODES is interaction and cooperation between the music creators and their partners.\n## Effectiveness\nAssessing the effectiveness of ITS programs is problematic. ITS vary greatly in design, implementation, and educational focus. When ITS are used in a classroom, the system is not only used by students, but by teachers as well. This usage can create barriers to effective evaluation for a number of reasons; most notably due to teacher intervention in student learning.\nTeachers often have the ability to enter new problems into the system or adjust the curriculum. In addition, teachers and peers often interact with students while they learn with ITSs (e.g., during an individual computer lab session or during classroom lectures falling in between lab sessions) in ways that may influence their learning with the software. Prior work suggests that the vast majority of students' help-seeking behavior in classrooms using ITSs may occur entirely outside of the software - meaning that the nature and quality of peer and teacher feedback in a given class may be an important mediator of student learning in these contexts. In addition, aspects of classroom climate, such as students' overall level of comfort in publicly asking for help, or the degree to which a teacher is physically active in monitoring individual students may add additional sources of variation across evaluation contexts. All of these variables make evaluation of an ITS complex, and may help explain variation in results across evaluation studies.\nDespite the inherent complexities, numerous studies have attempted to measure the overall effectiveness of ITS, often by comparisons of ITS to human tutors. Reviews of early ITS systems (1995) showed an effect size of d = 1.0 in comparison to no tutoring, where as human tutors were given an effect size of d = 2.0. Kurt VanLehn's much more recent overview (2011) of modern ITS found that there was no statistical difference in effect size between expert one-on-one human tutors and step-based ITS. Some individual ITS have been evaluated more positively than others. Studies of the Algebra Cognitive Tutor found that the ITS students outperformed students taught by a classroom teacher on standardized test problems and real-world problem solving tasks. Subsequent studies found that these results were particularly pronounced in students from special education, non-native English, and low-income backgrounds.\nA more recent meta-analysis suggests that ITSs can exceed the effectiveness of both CAI and human tutors, especially when measured by local (specific) tests as opposed to standardized tests. \"Students who received intelligent tutoring outperformed students from conventional classes in 46 (or 92%) of the 50 controlled evaluations, and the improvement in performance was great enough to be considered of substantive importance in 39 (or 78%) of the 50 studies. The median ES in the 50 studies was 0.66, which is considered a moderate-to-large effect for studies in the social sciences. It is roughly equivalent to an improvement in test performance from the 50th to the 75th percentile. This is stronger than typical effects from other forms of tutoring. C.-L. C. Kulik and Kulik's (1991) meta-analysis, for example, found an average ES of 0.31 in 165 studies of CAI tutoring. ITS gains are about twice as high. The ITS effect is also greater than typical effects from human tutoring. As we have seen, programs of human tutoring typically raise student test scores about 0.4 standard deviations over control levels. Developers of ITSs long ago set out to improve on the success of CAI tutoring and to match the success of human tutoring. Our results suggest that ITS developers have already met both of these goals.... Although effects were moderate to strong in evaluations that measured outcomes on locally developed tests, they were much smaller in evaluations that measured outcomes on standardized tests. Average ES on studies with local tests was 0.73; average ES on studies with standardized tests was 0.13. This discrepancy is not unusual for meta-analyses that include both local and standardized tests... local tests are likely to align well with the objectives of specific instructional programs. Off-the-shelf standardized tests provide a looser fit. ... Our own belief is that both local and standardized tests provide important information about instructional effectiveness, and when possible, both types of tests should be included in evaluation studies.\"\nSome recognized strengths of ITS are their ability to provide immediate yes/no feedback, individual task selection, on-demand hints, and support mastery learning.\n## Limitations\nIntelligent tutoring systems are expensive both to develop and implement. The research phase paves the way for the development of systems that are commercially viable. However, the research phase is often expensive; it requires the cooperation and input of subject matter experts, the cooperation and support of individuals across both organizations and organizational levels. Another limitation in the development phase is the conceptualization and the development of software within both budget and time constraints. There are also factors that limit the incorporation of intelligent tutors into the real world, including the long timeframe required for development and the high cost of the creation of the system components. A high portion of that cost is a result of content component building. For instance, surveys revealed that encoding an hour of online instruction time took 300 hours of development time for tutoring content. Similarly, building the Cognitive Tutor took a ratio of development time to instruction time of at least 200:1 hours. The high cost of development often eclipses replicating the efforts for real world application. Intelligent tutoring systems are not, in general, commercially feasible for real-world applications.\nA criticism of Intelligent Tutoring Systems currently in use, is the pedagogy of immediate feedback and hint sequences that are built in to make the system \"intelligent\". This pedagogy is criticized for its failure to develop deep learning in students. When students are given control over the ability to receive hints, the learning response created is negative. Some students immediately turn to the hints before attempting to solve the problem or complete the task. When it is possible to do so, some students bottom out the hints – receiving as many hints as possible as fast as possible – in order to complete the task faster. If students fail to reflect on the tutoring system's feedback or hints, and instead increase guessing until positive feedback is garnered, the student is, in effect, learning to do the right thing for the wrong reasons. Most tutoring systems are currently unable to detect shallow learning, or to distinguish between productive versus unproductive struggle (though see, e.g.,). For these and many other reasons (e.g., overfitting of underlying models to particular user populations), the effectiveness of these systems may differ significantly across users.\nAnother criticism of intelligent tutoring systems is the failure of the system to ask questions of the students to explain their actions. If the student is not learning the domain language than it becomes more difficult to gain a deeper understanding, to work collaboratively in groups, and to transfer the domain language to writing. For example, if the student is not \"talking science\" than it is argued that they are not being immersed in the culture of science, making it difficult to undertake scientific writing or participate in collaborative team efforts. Intelligent tutoring systems have been criticized for being too \"instructivist\" and removing intrinsic motivation, social learning contexts, and context realism from learning.\nPractical concerns, in terms of the inclination of the sponsors/authorities and the users to adapt intelligent tutoring systems, should be taken into account. First, someone must have a willingness to implement the ITS. Additionally an authority must recognize the necessity to integrate an intelligent tutoring software into current curriculum and finally, the sponsor or authority must offer the needed support through the stages of the system development until it is completed and implemented.\nEvaluation of an intelligent tutoring system is an important phase; however, it is often difficult, costly, and time-consuming. Even though there are various evaluation techniques presented in the literature, there are no guiding principles for the selection of appropriate evaluation method(s) to be used in a particular context. Careful inspection should be undertaken to ensure that a complex system does what it claims to do. This assessment may occur during the design and early development of the system to identify problems and to guide modifications (i.e. formative evaluation). In contrast, the evaluation may occur after the completion of the system to support formal claims about the construction, behaviour of, or outcomes associated with a completed system (i.e. summative evaluation). The great challenge introduced by the lack of evaluation standards resulted in neglecting the evaluation stage in several existing ITS'.\n## Improvements\nIntelligent tutoring systems are less capable than human tutors in the areas of dialogue and feedback. For example, human tutors are able to interpret the affective state of the student, and potentially adapt instruction in response to these perceptions. Recent work is exploring potential strategies for overcoming these limitations of ITSs, to make them more effective.\nDialogue\nHuman tutors have the ability to understand a person's tone and inflection within a dialogue and interpret this to provide continual feedback through an ongoing dialogue. Intelligent tutoring systems are now being developed to attempt to simulate natural conversations. To get the full experience of dialogue there are many different areas in which a computer must be programmed; including being able to understand tone, inflection, body language, and facial expression and then to respond to these. Dialogue in an ITS can be used to ask specific questions to help guide students and elicit information while allowing students to construct their own knowledge. The development of more sophisticated dialogue within an ITS has been a focus in some current research partially to address the limitations and create a more constructivist approach to ITS. In addition, some current research has focused on modeling the nature and effects of various social cues commonly employed within a dialogue by human tutors and tutees, in order to build trust and rapport (which have been shown to have positive impacts on student learning).\nEmotional affect\nA growing body of work is considering the role of affect on learning, with the objective of developing intelligent tutoring systems that can interpret and adapt to the different emotional states. Humans do not just use cognitive processes in learning but the affective processes they go through also plays an important role. For example, learners learn better when they have a certain level of disequilibrium (frustration), but not enough to make the learner feel completely overwhelmed. This has motivated affective computing to begin to produce and research creating intelligent tutoring systems that can interpret the affective process of an individual. An ITS can be developed to read an individual's expressions and other signs of affect in an attempt to find and tutor to the optimal affective state for learning. There are many complications in doing this since affect is not expressed in just one way but in multiple ways so that for an ITS to be effective in interpreting affective states it may require a multimodal approach (tone, facial expression, etc...). These ideas have created a new field within ITS, that of Affective Tutoring Systems (ATS). One example of an ITS that addresses affect is Gaze Tutor which was developed to track students eye movements and determine whether they are bored or distracted and then the system attempts to reengage the student.\nRapport Building\nTo date, most ITSs have focused purely on the cognitive aspects of tutoring and not on the social relationship between the tutoring system and the student. As demonstrated by the Computers are social actors paradigm humans often project social heuristics onto computers. For example, in observations of young children interacting with Sam the CastleMate, a collaborative story telling agent, children interacted with this simulated child in much the same manner as they would a human child. It has been suggested that to effectively design an ITS that builds rapport with students, the ITS should mimic strategies of instructional immediacy, behaviors which bridge the apparent social distance between students and teachers such as smiling and addressing students by name. With regard to teenagers, Ogan et al. draw from observations of close friends tutoring each other to argue that in order for an ITS to build rapport as a peer to a student, a more involved process of trust building is likely necessary which may ultimately require that the tutoring system possess the capability to effectively respond to and even produce seemingly rude behavior in order to mediate motivational and affective student factors through playful joking and taunting.\nTeachable Agents\nTraditionally ITSs take on the role of autonomous tutors, however they can also take on the role of tutees for the purpose of learning by teaching exercises. Evidence suggests that learning by teaching can be an effective strategy for mediating self-explanation, improving feelings of self-efficacy, and boosting educational outcomes and retention. In order to replicate this effect the roles of the student and ITS can be switched. This can be achieved by designing the ITS to have the appearance of being taught as is the case in the Teachable Agent Arithmetic Game  and Betty's Brain. Another approach is to have students teach a machine learning agent which can learn to solve problems by demonstration and correctness feedback as is the case in the APLUS system built with SimStudent. In order to replicate the educational effects of learning by teaching teachable agents generally have a social agent built on top of them which poses questions or conveys confusion. For example, Betty from Betty's Brain will prompt the student to ask her questions to make sure that she understands the material, and Stacy from APLUS will prompt the user for explanations of the feedback provided by the student."], "selected_questions": ["What are the four basic components of an Intelligent Tutoring System ?", "What were the goals set out for Intelligent Computer Assisted Instruction  and Intelligent Tutoring Systems ?", "What is affective computing and how is it relevant to the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems ?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The four basic components of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) are:\n\n1.

Additionally, the goal was to provide high quality education to each and every student, regardless of their individual learning needs and abilities. These systems also focused on promoting individualized learning, just-in-time feedback, and flexibility in time and space for the learners. Overall, the primary goal of both ICAI and ITS was to enable meaningful and effective learning through the use of computing technologies.", "Affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects. Affect refers to the experience of feelings or emotions, and affective computing aims to incorporate emotional and social intelligence into computing and technological systems.\n\nIn the context of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), affective computing is relevant to the development of systems that can interpret and adapt to the emotional states of the students.

The theory states that when a country produces more than it can consume it produces a surplus. This underutilization causes an inward movement on the production possibilities frontier. Trade with another country is then used to vent off this surplus and to bring the production possibilities frontier back to full capacity.\nConcerning the classical formulation of the theory (by Adam Smith), John Stuart Mill, in his ‘’Principles of Political Economy’’ says, that the “vent for surplus” approach is “in truth a surviving relic of the Mercantile Theory, according to which, money being the only wealth, selling, or in other words, exchanging goods for money, was (to countries without mines of their own) the only way of growing rich—and importation of goods, that is to say, parting with money, was so much subtracted from the benefit.”"], "selected_questions": ["How does the Mercantile Theory view exchange of goods for money?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": [""], "InternLM_answers": ["The Mercantile Theory is an economic theory that holds that a country's wealth is measured by its stock of precious metals, such as gold and silver.

The CGTA gathered many unionist delegates who refused to participate to the Normalisation Congress, opposing collaboration with the junta. It had support from various artists, among whom Rodolfo Walsh, author of the \"Program of 1st of May\" of the CGTA and chief editor of its weekly. The CGTA was also close to the clerical Movimiento de Sacerdotes para el Tercer Mundo, a group of priests close to the Liberation Theology, forming one of the first model of Neoperonism.\nThe CGTA supported the more radical unions' branches (ports, oil, sugar industry, etc.), quickly establishing national scale.

{"name": "RDRAND", "documents": ["# RDRAND\nRDRAND (for \"read random\"; known as Intel Secure Key Technology, previously known as Bull Mountain) is an instruction for returning random numbers from an Intel on-chip hardware random number generator which has been seeded by an on-chip entropy source. Intel introduced the feature around 2012, and AMD added support for the instruction in June 2015. (RDRAND is available in Ivy Bridge processors and is part of the Intel 64 and IA-32 instruction set architectures.)\nThe random number generator is compliant with security and cryptographic standards such as NIST SP 800-90A, FIPS 140-2, and ANSI X9.82. Intel also requested Cryptography Research Inc. to review the random number generator in 2012, which resulted in the paper Analysis of Intel's Ivy Bridge Digital Random Number Generator.\nRDSEED is similar to RDRAND and provides lower-level access to the entropy-generating hardware. The RDSEED generator and processor instruction rdseed are available with Intel Broadwell CPUs and AMD Zen CPUs.\n## Overview\nThe CPUID instruction can be used on both AMD and Intel CPUs to check whether the RDRAND instruction is supported. If it is, bit 30 of the ECX register is set after calling CPUID standard function 01H. AMD processors are checked for the feature using the same test. RDSEED availability can be checked on Intel CPUs in a similar manner. If RDSEED is supported, the bit 18 of the EBX register is set after calling CPUID standard function 07H.\nThe opcode for RDRAND is 0x0F 0xC7, followed by a ModRM byte that specifies the destination register and optionally combined with a REX prefix in 64-bit mode.\nIntel Secure Key is Intel's name for both the RDRAND instruction and the underlying random number generator (RNG) hardware implementation, which was codenamed \"Bull Mountain\" during development. Intel calls their RNG a \"digital random number generator\" or DRNG. The generator takes pairs of 256-bit raw entropy samples generated by the hardware entropy source and applies them to an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) (in CBC-MAC mode) conditioner which reduces them to a single 256-bit conditioned entropy sample. A deterministic random-bit generator called CTR DRBG defined in NIST SP 800-90A is seeded by the output from the conditioner, providing cryptographically secure random numbers to applications requesting them via the RDRAND instruction. The hardware will issue a maximum of 511 128-bit samples before changing the seed value. Using the RDSEED operation provides access to the conditioned 256-bit samples from the AES-CBC-MAC.\nThe RDSEED instruction was added to Intel Secure Key for seeding another pseudorandom number generator, available in Broadwell CPUs. The entropy source for the RDSEED instruction runs asynchronously on a self-timed circuit and uses thermal noise within the silicon to output a random stream of bits at the rate of 3 GHz, slower than the effective 6.4 Gbit/s obtainable from RDRAND (both rates are shared between all cores and threads). The RDSEED instruction is intended for seeding a software PRNG of arbitrary width, whereas the RDRAND is intended for applications that merely require high-quality random numbers. If cryptographic security is not required, a software PRNG such as Xorshift is usually faster.\n### Performance\nOn an Intel Core i7-7700K, 4500 MHz (45 × 100 MHz) processor (Kaby Lake-S microarchitecture), a single RDRAND or RDSEED instruction takes 110 ns, or 463 clock cycles, regardless of the operand size (16/32/64 bits). This number of clock cycles applies to all processors with Skylake or Kaby Lake microarchitecture. On the Silvermont microarchitecture processors, each of the instructions take around 1472 clock cycles, regardless of the operand size; and on Ivy Bridge processors RDRAND takes up to 117 clock cycles.\nOn an AMD Ryzen CPU, each of the instructions takes around 1200 clock cycles for 16-bit or 32-bit operand, and around 2500 clock cycles for a 64-bit operand.\nAn astrophysical Monte Carlo simulator examined the time to generate 107 64-bit random numbers using RDRAND on a quad-core Intel i7-3740 QM processor. They found that a C implementation of RDRAND ran about 2× slower than the default random number generator in C, and about 20× slower than the Mersenne Twister. Although a Python module of RDRAND has been constructed, it was found to be 20× slower than the default random number generator in Python, although a performance comparison between a PRNG and CSPRNG cannot be made.\nA microcode update released by Intel in June 2020, designed to mitigate the CrossTalk vulnerability (see the security issues section below), negatively impacts the performance of RDRAND and RDSEED due to additional security controls. On processors with the mitigations applied, each affected instruction incurs additional latency and simultaneous execution of RDRAND or RDSEED across cores is effectively serialised. Intel introduced a mechanism to relax these security checks, thus reducing the performance impact in most scenarios, but Intel processors do not apply this security relaxation by default.\n### Compilers\nVisual C++ 2015 provides intrinsic wrapper support for the RDRAND and RDSEED functions. GCC 4.6+ and Clang 3.2+ provide intrinsic functions for RDRAND when -mrdrnd is specified in the flags, also setting __RDRND__ to allow conditional compilation. Newer versions additionally provide immintrin.h to wrap these built-ins into functions compatible with version 12.1+ of Intel's C Compiler. These functions write random data to the location pointed to by their parameter, and return 1 on success.\n## Applications\nIt is an option to generate cryptographically secure random numbers using RDRAND and RDSEED in OpenSSL, to help secure communications.\nA scientific application of RDRAND can be found in astrophysics. Radio observations of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs have revealed that a number of them emit bursts of radio waves. These radio waves are caused by magnetic reconnection, the same process that causes solar flares on the Sun. RDRAND was used to generate large quantities of random numbers for a Monte Carlo simulator, to model physical properties of the brown dwarfs and the effects of the instruments that observe them. They found that about 5% of brown dwarfs are sufficiently magnetic to emit strong radio bursts. They also evaluated the performance of the RDRAND instruction in C and Python compared to other random number generators.\n## Reception\nIn September 2013, in response to a New York Times article revealing the NSA's effort to weaken encryption, Theodore Ts'o publicly posted concerning the use of RDRAND for /dev/random in the Linux kernel:\nI am so glad I resisted pressure from Intel engineers to let /dev/random rely only on the RDRAND instruction. To quote from the ]: \"By this year, the Sigint Enabling Project had found ways inside some of the encryption chips that scramble information for businesses and governments, either by working with chipmakers to insert back doors...\" Relying solely on the hardware random number generator which is using an implementation sealed inside a chip which is impossible to audit is a BAD idea.\nLinus Torvalds dismissed concerns about the use of RDRAND in the Linux kernel and pointed out that it is not used as the only source of entropy for /dev/random, but rather used to improve the entropy by combining the values received from RDRAND with other sources of randomness. However, Taylor Hornby of Defuse Security demonstrated that the Linux random number generator could become insecure if a backdoor is introduced into the RDRAND instruction that specifically targets the code using it. Hornby's proof-of-concept implementation works on an unmodified Linux kernel prior to version 3.13. The issue was mitigated in the Linux kernel in 2013.\nDevelopers changed the FreeBSD kernel away from using RDRAND and VIA PadLock directly with the comment \"For FreeBSD 10, we are going to backtrack and remove RDRAND and Padlock backends and feed them into Yarrow instead of delivering their output directly to /dev/random. It will still be possible to access hardware random number generators, that is, RDRAND, Padlock etc., directly by inline assembly or by using OpenSSL from userland, if required, but we cannot trust them any more.\" FreeBSD /dev/random uses Fortuna and RDRAND started from FreeBSD 11.\n## Security issues\nOn 9 June 2020, researchers from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam published a side-channel attack named CrossTalk (CVE-2020-0543) that affected RDRAND on a number of Intel processors. They discovered that outputs from the hardware digital random number generator (DRNG) were stored in a staging buffer that was shared across all cores. The vulnerability allowed malicious code running on an affected processor to read RDRAND and RDSEED instruction results from a victim application running on another core of that same processor, including applications running inside Intel SGX enclaves. The researchers developed a proof-of-concept exploit which extracted a complete ECDSA key from an SGX enclave running on a separate CPU core after only one signature operation. The vulnerability affects scenarios where untrusted code runs alongside trusted code on the same processor, such as in a shared hosting environment.\nIntel refers to the CrossTalk vulnerability as Special Register Buffer Data Sampling (SRBDS). In response to the research, Intel released microcode updates to mitigate the issue. The updated microcode ensures that off-core accesses are delayed until sensitive operations – specifically the RDRAND, RDSEED, and EGETKEY instructions – are completed and the staging buffer has been overwritten. The SRBDS attack also affects other instructions, such as those that read MSRs, but Intel did not apply additional security protections to them due to performance concerns and the reduced need for confidentiality of those instructions' results. A wide range of Intel processors released between 2012 and 2019 were affected, including desktop, mobile, and server processors. The mitigations themselves resulted in negative performance impacts when using the affected instructions, particularly when executed in parallel by multi-threaded applications, due to increased latency introduced by the security checks and the effective serialisation of affected instructions across cores. Intel introduced an opt-out option, configurable via the IA32_MCU_OPT_CTRL MSR on each logical processor, which improves performance by disabling the additional security checks for instructions executing outside of an SGX enclave."], "selected_questions": ["How do crypto standards such as FIPS 140-2 and NIST SP 800-90A relate to the random number generator used in RDRAND?", "What is the security issue related to RDRAND and what steps were taken by Intel to mitigate it?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["", "The security issue related to RDRAND is the CrossTalk vulnerability (CVE-2020-0543), which affects a number of Intel processors.

W. Winnicott, and Adam Phillips.\n## Neo-Freudian ideas\n### History\nAs early as 1936, Erich Fromm had been independently regretting that psychoanalysts \"did not concern themselves with the variety of life experience…and therefore did not try to explain psychic structure as determined by social structure.\" Karen Horney, too, \"emphasised the role culture exerts in the development of personality and downplayed the classical driven features outlined by Freud.\": 61 \nErik H. Erikson, for his part, stressed that \"psychoanalysis today is…shifting its emphasis…to the study of the ego's roots in the social organisation,\" and that its method should be \"what H. S. Sullivan called 'participant', and systematically so.\"\nDoctor and psychotherapist Harald Schultz-Hencke (1892–1953) was thoroughly busy with questions like impulse and inhibition and with the therapy of psychoses as well as the interpretation of dreams. He worked with Matthias Göring in his institute (Deutsches Institut für psychologische Forschung und Psychotherapie), and created the name Neopsychoanalyse in 1945. The \"Neo-Freudian revolt against the orthodox theory of instincts\" was thus anchored in a sense of what Harry Stack Sullivan termed \"our incredibly culture-ridden life.\" By their writings, and \"in accessible prose, Fromm, Horney, and others mounted a cultural and social critique which became almost conventional wisdom.\"\nThrough informal and more formal institutional links, such as the William Alanson White Institute, as well as through likeness of ideas, the neo-Freudians made up a cohesively distinctive and influential psychodynamic movement.\n### Basic anxiety\nKaren Horney theorized that to deal with basic anxiety, the individual has three options:\nMoving toward others: Accept the situation and become dependent on others. This strategy may entail an exaggerated desire for approval or affection. Moving against others: Resist the situation and become aggressive. This strategy may involve an exaggerated need for power, exploitation of others, recognition, or achievement. Moving away from others: Withdraw from others and become isolated. This strategy may involve an exaggerated need for self-sufficiency, privacy, or independence.\n### Basic personality\nThe neo-Freudian Abram Kardiner was primarily interested in learning how a specific society acquires adaptation concerning its environment. He does this by forming within its members what he names a \"basic personality.\" The \"basic personality\" can initially be traced to the operation of primary institutions. It ultimately creates clusters of unconscious motivations in the specific individual \"which in turn are projected in the form of secondary institutions,\" such as reality systems. The basic personality finds expression in the secondary institutions.\n## Criticism\n\"Fenichel developed a stringent theoretical critique of the neo-Freudians\", which informed and fed into the way \"Herbert Marcuse, in his 'Critique of Neo-Freudian Revisionism'...icily examines the tone of uplift and the Power of Positive Thinking that pervades the revisionists' writings, and mocks their claims to scientific seriousness.\"\nIn comparable fashion, \"an article…by Mr Edward Glover, entitled Freudian or Neo-Freudian, directed entirely against the constructions of Mr Alexander\" equally used the term as a form of orthodox reproach.\nIn the wake of such contemporary criticism, a \"consistent critique levelled at most theorists cited above is that they compromise the intrapersonal interiority of the psyche;\" but one may accept nonetheless that \"they have contributed an enduring and vital collection of standpoints relating to the human subject.\": 66 \n## Influence, successors, and offshoots\nIn 1940, Carl Rogers had launched what would become person-centred psychotherapy, \"crediting its roots in the therapy of Rank...& in the neo-Freudian analysts—especially Karen Horney.\": 109  A decade later, he would report that it had \"developed along somewhat different paths than the psychotherapeutic views of Horney or Sullivan, or Alexander and French, yet there are many threads of interconnection with these modern formulations of psychoanalytic thinking.\": 279 \nA half-century further on, whether by direct or by indirect influence, \"consistent with the traditions of these schools, current theorists of the social and psychodynamic self are working in the spaces between social and political theory and psychoanalysis\" once again.\n### Cultural offshoots\nIn his skit on Freud's remark that \"if my name were Oberhuber, my innovations would have found far less resistance,\" Peter Gay, considering the notional eclipse of \"Oberhuber\" by his replacement Freud, adjudged that \"the prospect that deviants would have to be called neo-Oberhuberians, or Oberhuberian revisionists, contributed to the master's decline.\"\n## Neo-Freudians\nAlfred Adler Erik Erikson Erich Fromm Frieda Fromm-Reichmann Karen Horney Carl Jung Abram Kardiner Harald Schultz-Hencke Harry Stack Sullivan Clara Thompson\n### Others with possible neo-Freudian links\nFranz Alexander Jessica Benjamin Nancy Chodorow Richard Hakim Thomas Ogden David Rapaport Alex Unger"], "selected_questions": ["What are the three options that Karen Horney theorized individuals have to deal with basic anxiety?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": [""], "InternLM_answers": ["Karen Horney theorized that individuals have three options to deal with basic anxiety:\n\n1.

{"name": "Christian abolitionism", "documents": ["# Christian abolitionism\nAlthough many Enlightenment philosophers opposed slavery, it was Christian activists, attracted by strong religious elements, who initiated and organized an abolitionist movement.  Throughout Europe and the United States, Christians, usually from \"un-institutional\" Christian faith movements, not directly connected with traditional state churches, or \"non-conformist\" believers within established churches, were to be found at the forefront of the abolitionist movements.\n## Ancient times\nPaul, the author of several letters that are part of the New Testament, requests the manumission of a slave named Onesimus in his letter to Philemon, writing \"Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever—no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother\" (Philemon 15-16). In addition, the Book of Revelation condemns the slave trade on the basis that it involves the marketing of human souls and their bodies as if they were cargo. The views that Paul and Revelation are not the only ones in ancient Judaism to oppose slavery. The Essenes, a radical Jewish sect in Israel which rejected much of the institutions of civilization, also rejected slavery, for violating the free equality of man.\nIn the fourth century, the bishop Gregory of Nyssa articulated a fundamentally Christian conception of the world that embedded a thorough rejection of the notion that one human could be owned by another and a condemnation of the institution of slavery. The historian Kyle Harper  writes:\nHumans were granted mastery over the animals by God. But in practicing slavery, humans overstepped the boundaries of their appointment. Gregory proceeded to attack slavery by questioning, philosophically, the paradigmatic act of the slave system: the sale. With penetrating insight, he asked how the human being, the rational creation of God, could be given a “price.” What, he asked, could have the same market value as human nature? “How much does rationality cost? How many obols for the image of God? How many staters did you get for selling the God-formed man?” Here Gregory offers a logic that was entirely novel in the ancient world but would reverberate in later centuries with tremendous consequence.\n## Christian abolitionism in the United Kingdom\nIn particular, the effects of the Second Great Awakening resulted in many evangelicals working to see the theoretical Christian view, that all people are essentially equal, made more of a practical reality. Freedom of expression within the Western world also helped in enabling opportunity to express their position. Prominent among these abolitionists was Parliamentarian William Wilberforce in England, who wrote in his diary when he was 28 that, \"God Almighty has set before me two great objects, the suppression of the Slave Trade and Reformation of Morals.\" With others he labored, despite determined opposition, to finally abolish the British slave trade. English preacher Charles Spurgeon had some of his sermons burned in America due to his censure of slavery, calling it \"the foulest blot\" and which \"may have to be washed out in blood\". Methodist founder John Wesley denounced human bondage as \"the sum of all villainies\", and detailed its abuses. In Georgia, primitive Methodists united with brethren elsewhere in condemning slavery. Many evangelical leaders in the United States such as Presbyterian Charles Finney and Theodore Weld, and women such as Harriet Beecher Stowe (daughter of abolitionist Lyman Beecher) and Sojourner Truth motivated hearers to support abolition. Finney preached that slavery was a moral sin, and so supported its elimination. \"I had made up my mind on the question of slavery, and was exceedingly anxious to arouse public attention to the subject. In my prayers and preaching, I so often alluded to slavery, and denounced it. Repentance from slavery was required of souls, once enlightened of the subject, while continued support of the system incurred \"the greatest guilt\" upon them.\nIn 1787 the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade was formed, with 9 of the 12 founder members being Quakers. During the same year, William Wilberforce was persuaded to take up their cause; as an MP, Wilberforce was able to introduce a bill to abolish the slave trade. Wilberforce first attempted to abolish the trade in 1791, but could only muster half the necessary votes; however, after transferring his support to the Whigs, it became an election issue. Abolitionist pressure had changed popular opinion, and in the 1806 election enough abolitionists entered parliament for Wilberforce to be able to see the passing of the Slave Trade Act 1807. The Royal Navy subsequently declared that the slave trade was equal to piracy, the West Africa Squadron choosing to seize ships involved in the transfer of slaves and liberate the slaves on board, effectively crippling the transatlantic trade. Through abolitionist efforts, popular opinion continued to mount against slavery, and in 1833 slavery itself was outlawed throughout the British Empire – at that time containing roughly one-sixth of the world's population (rising to a quarter towards the end of the century).\n## Quaker abolitionists\nQuakers in particular were early leaders in abolitionism. In 1688 Dutch Quakers in Germantown, Pennsylvania, sent an antislavery petition to the Monthly Meeting of Quakers. By 1727 British Quakers had expressed their official disapproval of the slave trade. Three Quaker abolitionists, Benjamin Lay, John Woolman, and Anthony Benezet, devoted their lives to the abolitionist effort from the 1730s to the 1760s, with Lay founding the Negro School in 1770, which would serve more than 250 pupils. In June 1783, a petition from the London Yearly Meeting and signed by over 300 Quakers was presented to Parliament protesting the slave trade.\n## Christian abolitionism in the United States\nIn the United States, the abolition movement faced much opposition. Bertram Wyatt-Brown notes that the appearance of the Christian abolitionist movement \"with its religious ideology alarmed newsmen, politicians, and ordinary citizens. They angrily predicted the endangerment of secular democracy, the mongrelization, as it was called, of white society, and the destruction of the federal union. Speakers at huge rallies and editors of conservative papers in the North denounced these newcomers to radical reform as the same old “church-and-state” zealots, who tried to shut down post offices, taverns, carriage companies, shops, and other public places on Sundays. Mob violence sometimes ensued.\"\nA postal campaign in 1835 by the American Anti-Slavery Society (AA-SS) – founded by African-American Presbyterian clergyman Theodore S. Wright – sent bundles of tracts and newspapers (over 100,000) to prominent clerical, legal, and political figures throughout the whole country, and culminated in massive demonstrations throughout the North and South. In attempting to stop these mailings, New York Postmaster Samuel L. Gouverneur unsuccessfully requested the AA-SS to cease sending it to the South. He therefore decided that he would “aid in preserving the public peace” by refusing to allow the mails to carry abolition pamphlets to the South himself, with the new Postmaster General Amos Kendall affirming, even though he admitted he had no legal authority to do so. This resulted in the AA-SS resorting to other and clandestine means of dissemination.\nDespite such determined opposition, many Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian members freed their slaves and sponsored black congregations, in which many black ministers encouraged slaves to believe that freedom could be gained during their lifetime. After a great revival occurred in 1801 at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, American Methodists made anti-slavery sentiments a condition of church membership. Abolitionist writings, such as \"A Condensed Anti-Slavery Bible Argument\" (1845) by George Bourne, and \"God Against Slavery\" (1857) by George B. Cheever, used the Bible, logic and reason extensively in contending against the institution of slavery, and in particular the chattel form of it as seen in the South. In Cheever's speech entitled, \"The Fire and Hammer of God’s Word Against the Sin of Slavery\", his desire for eliminating the crime of slaveholding is clear, as he goes so far as to address it to the President.\nOther Protestant missionaries of the Great Awakening initially opposed slavery in the South, but by the early decades of the 19th century, many Baptist and Methodist preachers in the South had come to an accommodation with it in order to evangelize the farmers and workers. Disagreements between the newer way of thinking and the old often created schisms within denominations at the time. Differences in views toward slavery resulted in the Baptist and Methodist churches dividing into regional associations by the beginning of the Civil War.\n## Catholic abolitionism\nRoman Catholic statements against slavery also grew increasingly vocal during this era. In 1741, Pope Benedict XIV condemned slavery generally. In 1815, Pope Pius VII demanded the Congress of Vienna to suppress the slave trade. In the Bull of Canonization of Peter Claver, one of the most illustrious adversaries of slavery, Pope Pius IX branded the \"supreme villainy\" (summum nefas) of the slave traders;\nIn 1839 Pope Gregory XVI condemned the slave trade in In supremo apostolatus; and in 1888 Pope Leo XIII condemned slavery in In Plurimis.\nRoman Catholic efforts extended to the Americas. The Roman Catholic leader of the Irish in Ireland, Daniel O'Connell, supported the abolition of slavery in the British Empire and in America. With the black abolitionist Charles Lenox Remond, and the temperance priest Theobold Mathew, he organized a petition with 60,000 signatures urging the Irish of the United States to support abolition. O'Connell also spoke in the United States for abolition.\nPreceding such, and while not explicitly expressing an abolitionist point of view, the Portuguese Dominican Gaspar da Cruz in 1569 strongly criticized the Portuguese traffic in Chinese slaves, explaining that any arguments by the slave traders that they \"legally\" purchased already-enslaved children were bogus.\nIn 1917, the Roman Catholic Church's canon law was officially expanded to specify that \"selling a human being into slavery or for any other evil purpose\" is a crime."], "selected_questions": ["What was the contribution of Quakers to the abolitionist effort?", "What actions did the Royal Navy take to address the slave trade in the 1800s?", "What was the stance of Methodist founder John Wesley on slavery?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The Quakers were early leaders in the abolitionist movement, with Dutch Quakers in Germantown, Pennsylvania, sending an antislavery petition in 1688 and British Quakers expressing disapproval of the slave trade by 1727.

In 1807, the British Parliament passed the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act, which outlawed the slave trade in British colonies. The Royal Navy was tasked with enforcing this law and stopping slave ships from operating in British waters. \n\nTo do this, the Royal Navy established a special squadron known as the West Africa Squadron. This squadron was responsible for patrolling the coast of West Africa and intercepting slave ships. Over the course of the 19th century, the West Africa Squadron captured and freed thousands of enslaved people. \n\nIn addition to the West Africa Squadron, the Royal Navy also worked with other countries to address the slave trade. In 1842, the Royal Navy helped establish the African Slave Trade Patrol, which was a joint effort between Britain, France, and the United States to stop the slave trade in the Atlantic. \n\nOverall, the Royal Navy played a crucial role in the abolition of the slave trade in the 1800s.", "John Wesley was a vocal opponent of slavery. He believed that it was a violation of the principles of Christianity and that it was a sin to participate in the buying or selling of human beings.

Music Maker Relief Foundation was founded in 1994 by Tim and Denise Duffy to \"help the true pioneers and forgotten heroes of Southern music gain recognition and meet their day-to-day needs. Music Maker presents these musical traditions to the world so American culture will flourish and be preserved for future generations.\"\n## History\n### Early years\nIn 1989, while completing his studies for a master's degree in Folklore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Tim Duffy was documenting blues musician James \"Guitar Slim\" Stephens for the university's Southern Folklife Collection. Stephens's health was in decline, and shortly before his death, he advised Duffy to locate a musician named Guitar Gabriel.\nAfter his graduation, Duffy began working as a substitute teacher at a middle school in Winston-Salem, hearing an assortment of folkloric tales about Guitar Gabriel from students, until one student volunteered that Gabriel was her neighbor, living in the government housing projects of Winston-Salem. That evening, Duffy followed the student's directions to a \"drink house\" in the neighborhood, where he met Gabriel's nephew, Hawkeye, who took him to meet Gabriel. Duffy forged a close friendship with Gabriel, and the two began recording and performing under the name Guitar Gabriel & Brothers in the Kitchen, releasing the album Do You Know What it Means to Have a Friend? (also known as Toot Blues) on their own Karibu label in 1991.\nGabriel had been inactive in the music industry since the 1970 release of his album My South, My Blues (as Nyles Jones) on the Gemini label. He had received no royalties and was impoverished. He required almost daily assistance from Duffy, who provided transportation to medical appointments, money, and food for Gabriel and his wife. Through Gabriel, Tim and Denise Duffy made field recordings of other local blues musicians, such as Captain Luke, Macavine Hayes, Mr. Q., and Willa Mae Buckner. They lived in poor conditions and needed regular assistance. Duffy thought their culture was slipping away unnoticed by the music industry.\nTim Duffy's father, Allen Duffy, a lawyer, had represented and won a case for audio pioneer Mark Levinson, allowing him to continue working in the hi-fi industry. Levinson heard about Tim Duffy's field recordings, some reminiscent of the work of John and Alan Lomax, and invited Duffy to visit his stereo showroom in New York. After hearing the recordings, as well as the stories of the many destitute musicians, Levinson offered to remaster the tapes, which became an eight-artist CD anthology of traditional North Carolina blues entitled A Living Past. Levinson became a crusader for the cause, and solicited funds and industry connections from his friends and colleagues, which, in 1994, resulted in the incorporation of the Music Maker Relief Foundation.\n### 1995–present\nIn 1995, Tim Duffy met Eric Clapton in a Manhattan bistro, sharing some of his field recordings, as well as the philosophy and goals of the foundation, after which Clapton became a supporter, introducing artists such as B.B. King, Pete Townshend, Bonnie Raitt, Ron Wood, Lou Reed and Rosanne Cash, all of whom donated to the Music Maker Relief Foundation. Duffy was invited to the Los Angeles studio where B.B. King's album Deuces Wild was recorded and where he met Taj Mahal, who contributed to the foundation's growth and success.\nBy 1996, after receiving several sizable donations, Music Maker Relief Foundation had established the Musician Sustenance, Musical Development, and Cultural Access Programs, which provide food, monetary assistance, transportation to doctor's appointments and to pick up medications, home repairs (in some cases, extremely poor living conditions have warranted the relocation of the musician), performance bookings in professional venues, such as the Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall, as well as European tours and music festivals worldwide. The success of the programs is due, in large part, to Taj Mahal, who by 1997 had become an advisory board member, artistic consultant, contributor, and co-producer for many of the artists' records. Taj Mahal headlined blues festivals in support of Music Maker, was instrumental in securing advertising in mainstream print media, as well as the creation of the \"Fishin' Blues Tournament\", which raises funds for the foundation. Over the next several years, many new donors and contributors were involved, allowing Duffy to expand the roster of the label, and to release over one hundred albums, the proceeds of which the artists keep, in their entirety. Many of the label's artists have been documented in the collaborative work of artists Harvey Pekar and Gary Dumm, who have contributed artwork since 2003, and whose work was featured in a 2010 calendar, created as a fundraiser for Music Maker Relief Foundation.\nIn 2006, Tim Duffy saw the Carolina Chocolate Drops performing at the Shakori Hills Grassroots Festival of Music and Dance in Silk Hope, North Carolina. Duffy signed a management deal with the group and released their debut record, Dona Got a Ramblin' Mind on the Music Maker Label. During Duffy's time as manager the Carolina Chocolate Drops won a Grammy Award in 2010 for Best Traditional Folk Album with their first album on Nonesuch Records, Genuine Negro Jig. The Chocolate Drops second release with Nonesuch, Leaving Eden was nominated for a Grammy.\nIn 2014, the Music Maker Relief Foundation celebrated its 20th anniversary with an exhibit of 28 photographs of Music Maker artists. The exhibit was previewed at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. A double-disc compilation album and 144-page photo book is also set to be released in honor of the foundation's anniversary.\nOn October 27, 2014 PBS NewsHour aired segment on the Music Maker Relief Foundation, showing William R. Ferris say, \"They provide a model for what our nation should be doing. The New Deal under FDR did this for the entire nation, and Tim Duffy thankfully is doing it for the community of blues artists.\"\n## Discography\n### Albums\n1999 : Railroad Bill by Etta Baker (MM7) 1999 : Sugar Man by Cootie Stark (MM8) 1999 : Back in Business by Beverly Watkins 2000 : Rain in Your Life by Essie Mae Brooks (MM15) 2000 : This Stuff Just Kills Me by Jerry McCain 2001 : Turn Off the Fear by Carl Rutherford (MM17) 2001 : Cool John Ferguson by Cool John Ferguson (MM18) 2001 : Unplugged by Jerry McCain (MM21) 2002 : Songs from the Roots of America (I & II) 2002 : Ragged but Right by Lightnin' Wells 2002 : Carolina Bluesman by Little Pink Anderson (MM24) 2002 : Cool Yule by Cool John Ferguson (MM29) 2003 : Guitar Heaven by Cool John Ferguson (MM34) 2003 : Boogie is My Name by Jerry McCain (MM34) 2004 : High Steppin' Momma by Clyde Langford (MM45) 2004 : Follow Your Heart's Desire by Pura Fé (MM48) 2004 : Musicmakers with Taj Mahal (MM49) 2004 : Etta Baker with Taj Mahal (MM50) 2005 : The Last & Lost Blues Survivors (Dixiefrog) 2005 : Tarboro Blues by George Higgs 2005 : Mississippi Rubberleg by Adolphus Bell 2005 : Lee Gates and the Alabama Cotton Kings by Lee Gates 2005 : Drinkhouse by Macavine Hayes (MM53) 2005 : Carolina Breakdown by Etta Baker with Cora Phillips (MM56) 2006 : One Man Band by Adolphus Bell (MM58) 2006 : Treasure Box (MM61-62-63) 2006 : John Dee Holeman & The Waifs Band (MM68) 2006 : Drink House to Church House Vol. 1 (Dixiefrog) with a DVD with John Dee Holeman, Captain Luke, Cool John Ferguson, Macavine Hayes, billed as 'Alabama Slim' and others 2006 : Rainy Day by George Higgs (MM77) 2006 : Black Lucy's Deuce by Lee Gates (MM60) 2006 : Touring With Lucy by Lee Gates 2006 : Dona Got A Ramblin' Mind by Carolina Chocolate Drops (MM76) 2007 : Back in Business by Beverly Watkins 2007 : Soul of the Blues by Albert White 2007 : Pickin' Low Cotton by Boo Hanks 2010 : 270 Haystack Rd. by Benton Flippen & The Smokey Valley Boys 2011 : Rare Traks by Guitar Lightnin' Lee And His Thunder Band (MM145) 2012 : I Know I've Been Changed by The Giddens Sisters 2012 : Buffalo Junction by Boo Hanks and Dom Flemons 2013 : Vari-colored Songs (A Tribute To Langston Hughes) by Leyla McCalla 2014 : Prospect Hill by Dom Flemons 2015 : Super Spirit by Ironing Board Sam 2016 : Albert White and the Rockers by Albert White\n### Compilation albums\nA Living Past MMCD 9401 (1994) Came So Far MMCD 1294 Expressin' the Blues MMKCD 701 (1999) Blues Came to Georgia MMCD 23 (2001) Sol - Volume: Blue MMCD 25 Songs from the Roots of America (Book w/ CD) (2002) Songs from the Roots of America II MMCD 28 (2002) Music Makers with Taj Mahal (2005) Music Maker Treasure Box (2006) Blues Sweet Blues (2007) Drink House to Church House Vol. 1 (2007) CD/DVD"], "selected_questions": ["How did Tim Duffy first meet Guitar Gabriel and what was the outcome of their meeting?", "What are some of the albums released by the Music Maker Relief Foundation and their associated artists?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Tim Duffy first met Guitar Gabriel when he followed the directions of a student to a \"drink house\" in Winston-Salem, where Gabriel lived.

These masks span five centuries, from the Muromachi to the Edo period (15th to 19th century), and are designated Important Cultural Properties.\nThe Konparu school was originally led by Konparu Zenchiku (1405 – ca. 1470) and his grandson Konparu Zenpō (1454 – ca. 1532). The troupe prospered during the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–1603), with a critical factor for their success being the patronage of the daimyō Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1537–1598), at a time when the leader of the Konparu school was Konparu Ansho (1549–1621), a retained actor of Toyotomi.\nDuring the late Edo period (1603–1868) the troupe faced difficulties and started to lose vitality, and during the Bakumatsu and the period of the Meiji Restoration in the late 19th century, many of the noh masks and other properties of the Konparu family were sold throughout Japan. In around 1868 this set of masks together with some other noh costumes and stage props were transferred to the Kasuga-taisha shrine in Nara.

{"name": "Consumption smoothing", "documents": ["# Consumption smoothing\nConsumption smoothing is an economic concept for the practice of optimizing a person's standard of living through an appropriate balance between savings and consumption over time. An optimal consumption rate should be relatively similar at each stage of a person's life rather than fluctuate wildly. Luxurious consumption at an old age does not compensate for an impoverished existence at other stages in one's life.\nSince income tends to be hump-shaped across an individual's life, economic theory suggests that individuals should on average have low or negative savings rate at early stages in their life, high in middle age, and negative during retirement. Although many popular books on personal finance advocate that individuals should at all stages of their life set aside money in savings, economist James Choi states that this deviates from the advice of economists.\n## Expected utility model\nThe graph below illustrates the expected utility model, in which U(c) is increasing in and concave in c. This shows that there are diminishing marginal returns associated with consumption, as each additional unit of consumption adds less utility. The expected utility model states that individuals want to maximize their expected utility, as defined as the weighted sum of utilities across states of the world. The weights in this model are the probabilities of each state of the world happening. According to the \"more is better\" principle, the first order condition will be positive; however, the second order condition will be negative, due to the principle of diminishing marginal utility. Due to the concave actual utility, marginal utility decreases as consumption increase; as a result, it is favorable to reduce consumption in states of high income to increase consumption in low income states.\nExpected utility can be modeled as:\nE U = q ∗ U ( W | b a d s t a t e ) + ( 1 − q ) ∗ U ( W | g o o d s t a t e ) {\\displaystyle EU=q*U(W|badstate)+(1-q)*U(W|goodstate)}\nwhere:\nq {\\displaystyle q} = probability you will lose all your wealth/consumption\nW {\\displaystyle W} = wealth\nThe model shows expected utility as the sum of the probability of being in a bad state multiplied by utility of being in a bad state and the probability of being in a good state multiplied by utility of being in a good state.\nSimilarly, actuarially fair insurance can also be modeled:\nE U = ( 1 − q ) ∗ U ( W − p ) + q ∗ U ( W − p − d + p / q ) {\\displaystyle EU=(1-q)*U(W-p)+q*U(W-p-d+p/q)}\nwhere:\nq {\\displaystyle q} = probability you will lose all your wealth/consumption\nW {\\displaystyle W} = wealth\nd {\\displaystyle d} = damages\nAn actuarially fair premium to pay for insurance would be the insurance premium that is set equal to the insurer's expected payout, so that the insurer will expect to earn zero profit. Some individuals are risk-averse, as shown by the graph above. The blue line, U ( c ) = c {\\displaystyle U(c)={\\sqrt {c}}} is curved upwards, revealing that this particular individual is risk-averse. If the blue line was curved downwards, this would reveal the preference for a risk-seeking individual. Additionally, a straight line would reveal a risk-neutral individual.\n## Insurance and consumption smoothing\nTo see the model of consumption smoothing in real life, a great example that exemplifies this is insurance. One method that people use to consumption smooth across different periods is by purchasing insurance. Insurance is important because it allows people to translate consumption from periods where their consumption is high (having a low marginal utility) to periods when their consumption is low (having a high marginal utility). Due to many possible states of the world, people want to decrease the amount of uncertain outcomes of the future. This is where purchasing insurance comes in. Basic insurance theory states that individuals will demand full insurance to fully smooth consumption across difference states of the world. This explains why people purchase insurance, whether in healthcare, unemployment, and social security. To help illustrate this, think of a simplified hypothetical scenario with Person A, who can exist in one of two states of the world. Assume Person A who is healthy and can work; this will be State X of the world. One day, an unfortunate accident occurs, person A no longer can work. Therefore, he cannot obtain income from work and is in State Y of the world. In State X, Person A enjoys a good income from his work place and is able to spend money on necessities, such as paying rent and buying groceries, and luxuries, such as traveling to Europe. In State Y, Person A no longer obtains an income, due to injury, and struggles to pay for necessities. In a perfect world, Person A would have known to save for this future accident and would have more savings to compensate for the lack of income post-injury. Rather than spend money on the trip to Europe in State X, Person A could have saved that money to use for necessities in State Y. However, people tend to be poor predictors of the future, especially ones that are myopic. Therefore, insurance can \"smooth\" between these two states and provide more certainty for the future.\n## Microcredit and consumption smoothing\nThough there are arguments stating that microcredit does not effectively lift people from poverty, some note that offering a way to consumption smooth during tough periods has shown to be effective. This supports the principle of diminishing marginal utility, where those who have a history of suffering in extremely low income states of the world want to prepare for the next time they experience an adverse state of the world. This leads to the support of microfinance as a tool to consumption smooth, stating that those in poverty value microloans tremendously due to its extremely high marginal utility.\n## Hall and Friedman's model\nAnother model to look at for consumption smoothing is Hall's model, which is inspired by Milton Friedman. Since Milton Friedman's permanent income theory (1956) and Modigliani and Brumberg (1954) life-cycle model, the idea that agents prefer a stable path of consumption has been widely accepted. This idea came to replace the perception that people had a marginal propensity to consume and therefore current consumption was tied to current income.\nFriedman's theory argues that consumption is linked to the permanent income of agents. Thus, when income is affected by transitory shocks, for example, agents' consumption should not change, since they can use savings or borrowing to adjust. This theory assumes that agents are able to finance consumption with earnings that are not yet generated, and thus assumes perfect capital markets. Empirical evidence shows that liquidity constraint is one of the main reasons why it is difficult to observe consumption smoothing in the data. In 1978, Robert Hall formalized Friedman's idea. By taking into account the diminishing returns to consumption, and therefore, assuming a concave utility function, he showed that agents optimally would choose to keep a stable path of consumption.\nWith (cf. Hall's paper)\nagents choose the consumption path that maximizes:\nSubject to a sequence of budget constraints:\nThe first order necessary condition in this case will be:\nBy assuming that R t + 1 = R = β − 1 {\\displaystyle R_{t+1}=R=\\beta ^{-1}} we obtain, for the previous equation:\nWhich, due to the concavity of the utility function, implies:\nThus, rational agents would expect to achieve the same consumption in every period.\nHall also showed that for a quadratic utility function, the optimal consumption is equal to:\nThis expression shows that agents choose to consume a fraction of their present discounted value of their human and financial wealth.\n## Empirical evidence for Hall and Friedman's model\nRobert Hall (1978) estimated the Euler equation in order to find evidence of a random walk in consumption. The data used are US National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) quarterly from 1948 to 1977. For the analysis the author does not consider the consumption of durable goods. Although Hall argues that he finds some evidence of consumption smoothing, he does so using a modified version. There are also some econometric concerns about his findings.\nWilcox (1989) argue that liquidity constraint is the reason why consumption smoothing does not show up in the data. Zeldes (1989) follows the same argument and finds that a poor household's consumption is correlated with contemporaneous income, while a rich household's consumption is not. A recent meta-analysis of 3000 estimates reported in 144 studies finds strong evidence for consumption smoothing."], "selected_questions": ["What is the expected utility model and how is it defined?", "What is microcredit and how does it relate to consumption smoothing?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The expected utility model is a concept that states that individuals want to maximize their expected utility, which is defined as the weighted sum of utilities across different states of the world.

The weights in this model are the probabilities of each state of the world happening. The model shows expected utility as the sum of the probability of being in a bad state multiplied by utility of being in a bad state and the probability of being in a good state multiplied by the utility of being in a good state.

These loans are often used by low-income individuals or groups to start or expand a small business.\n\nMicrocredit relates to consumption smoothing in the sense that it can help individuals smooth out their levels of consumption over time. For those living in poverty or experiencing low income states, microcredit can provide a means to obtain funds to invest in income-generating activities or to cover basic necessities during tough periods. By providing access to small loans, microcredit can help individuals overcome temporary financial downturns and stabilize their consumption patterns. This supports the economic principle of diminishing marginal utility, as those in poverty value microloans tremendously due to the high marginal utility of improving their consumption levels during difficult periods. Therefore, microcredit can be seen as a tool for consumption smoothing, as it helps individuals manage and balance their consumption levels across different states of the world."], "InternLM_answers": ["The expected utility model is a theoretical framework used to predict the choices that individuals make among risky alternatives. It assumes that individuals make decisions based on the expected value of the outcomes, which is a weighted average of the probability of each outcome and the utility (or satisfaction) associated with that outcome. The expected utility model is defined by the equation: EU = Σ(p(i) * u(i)), where EU is the expected utility, p(i) is the probability of outcome i, and u(i) is the utility associated with outcome i. The model is often used in economics, finance, and decision theory to analyze and predict individual behavior in situations involving risk and uncertainty.", "Microcredit is a type of financial service that provides small loans to individuals or groups who lack access to traditional banking services. These loans are typically used to start or expand small businesses, purchase assets, or cover unexpected expenses. Microcredit is often used by low-income individuals or those who are unemployed, and it can help them improve their financial situation and increase their income.\n\nConsumption smoothing is the practice of spreading out consumption over time to avoid large fluctuations in spending. Microcredit can be used to facilitate consumption smoothing by providing individuals with access to credit when they need it most. For example, if a farmer experiences a bad harvest and needs to purchase seeds for the next growing season, they can take out a microcredit loan to cover the cost. This allows them to smooth out their consumption over time and avoid going into debt or selling assets to cover unexpected expenses.\n\nOverall, microcredit and consumption smoothing are closely related because both aim to improve the financial stability and well-being of individuals and communities. By providing access to credit and helping individuals manage their expenses, microcredit can help individuals achieve their financial goals and improve their quality of life."],

These are expressed through language and behaviour, and the relationship between language and power. This form of analysis developed out of Foucault's genealogical work, where power was linked to the formation of discourse within specific historical periods. Some versions of this method stress the genealogical application of discourse analysis to illustrate how discourse is produced to govern social groups. The method analyses how the social world, expressed through language, is affected by various sources of power. As such, this approach is close to social constructivism, as the researcher tries to understand how our society is being shaped (or constructed) by language, which in turn reflects existing power relationships. The analysis attempts to understand how individuals view the world, and studies categorizations, personal and institutional relationships, ideology, and politics.\nThe approach was inspired by the work of both Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida, and by critical theory.\nFoucauldian discourse analysis, like much of critical theory, is often used in politically oriented studies. It is preferred by scholars who criticize more traditional forms of discourse analysis as failing to account for the political implications of discourse. Political power is gained by those in power being more knowledgeable and therefore more legitimate in exercising their control over others in both blatant and invisible ways.\n## Process\nKendall and Wickham outline five steps in using \"Foucauldian discourse analysis\". The first step is a simple recognition that discourse is a body of statements that are organized in a regular and systematic way. The subsequent four steps are based on the identification of rules on:\nhow those statements are created; what can be said (written) and what cannot; how spaces in which new statements can be made are created; making practices material and discursive at the same time.\n## Areas of study\nStudies employing the Foucauldian discourse analysis might look at how figures in authority use language to express their dominance, and request obedience and respect from those subordinate to them. The disciplinary interaction between authority and their followers emphasize the power dynamic found within the relationships. In a specific example, a study may look at the language used by teachers towards students, or military officers towards conscripts.

{"name": "Texas Equal Rights Association", "documents": ["# Texas Equal Rights Association\nThe Texas Equal Rights Association (TERA) was the first woman's suffrage association to be formed state-wide in Texas. The organization was founded in 1893 and was an affiliate of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. The TERA was meant to \"advance the industrial, educational, and equal rights of women, and to secure suffrage to them by appropriate State and national legislation.\" It was also an answer to Texas Governor James Stephen Hogg, who had stated publicly in a trip to the north that women's suffrage \"had not reached Texas\". The organization was firmly \"non-sectarian\", stating that \"it has no war to wage on religion, church or kindred societies.\"\n## History\nThe Texas Equal Rights Association (TERA) had its beginnings at a meeting which took place on April 8, 1993, and included Rebecca Henry Hayes and several members of the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Those who had worked with WCTU had prior experience in working with local politics. The organization was formally organized on May 10, 1893, at the Windsor hotel in Dallas. There were about fifty charter members, including many men who supported women's suffrage. TERA was affiliated with the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).\nThe first president of TERA, Hayes, was also the state delegate for NAWSA conventions. The vice president was Sarah L. Trumbull and the treasurer was Lucy Knowles. Margaret L. Watson served as the secretary. Other early officers included Mrs. W.S. Herndon, Dr. M. Ellen Keller, Alice McAnulty, Belle Zurchill, Mrs. S.E. Acheson, Mrs. A.E. Smythe, Mrs. L.A. Craig and Dr. Smith. TERA based their own constitution and bylaws on those of the Kentucky Equal Rights Association.\nTERA formed auxiliary organizations in several other Texas cities, including Dallas, San Antonio and Beaumont. A Fort Worth auxiliary was formed in 1894. Eventually nine local chapters were created, most of these in cities where officers of TERA lived. The first annual convention of TERA took place in Fort Worth from June 6 to 8 in 1894. Recruiting new members to the group was difficult, however, because of the perception that \"suffrage was radical and unwomanly\". Nevertheless, the efforts of TERA helped spark a state-wide interest in women's suffrage and increased coverage of suffrage in the news.\nOne incident that sparked division between the members of TERA was the idea to bring Susan B. Anthony to Texas in 1894 to speak about women's rights. Those in TERA who were opposed to Anthony's potential visit called her an \"outsider\" and were against Anthony's views on abolition. Hayes also contended that bringing Anthony and Anna Howard Shaw to speak in Texas would be too costly for TERA. The group began to split over this question. Members Elizabeth Fry and Grace Danforth asked Hayes to resign after she blocked the executive committee's vote to support Anthony's visit. When Hayes attended the NAWSA convention in November 1894, Fry, Danforth and Knowles declared the president's seat to be vacant. Hayes decried the motion, stating it was against the rules of TERA, and aired her grievances in The Galveston Daily News.\nIn 1895, Hayes resigned from TERA after she lost the bid for presidency of the group. The new president was Elizabeth Goode Houston. Also in 1895, the treasurer of TERA reported that the group only had a total of $13.50 in revenue. TERA continued to thrive until around 1896, and helped pave the way for later efforts towards women's suffrage in Texas, such as the Texas Woman Suffrage Association. However, the organization was beginning to dissolve. Nevertheless, Houston still attended the NAWSA convention in January 1896. The secretary of TERA, Watson, eventually ran for office in Beaumont, also in 1896. In early 1897, TERA was still sending representatives to meetings.

{"name": "Oudh Bequest", "documents": ["# Oudh Bequest\nThe Oudh Bequest is a waqf which led to the gradual transfer of more than six million rupees from the Indian kingdom of Oudh (Awadh) to the Shia holy cities of Najaf and Karbala between 1850 and 1903. The bequest first reached the cities in 1850. It was distributed by two mujtahids, one from each city. The British later gradually took over the bequest and its distribution; according to scholars, they intended to use it as a \"power lever\" to influence Iranian ulama and Shia. The attempts by the British to disburse the Oudh Bequest was one of the principle causes of the rise of the Society of Islamic Revival in 1918.\n## Background\nIn 1825, when Burma experienced economic problems, Oudh king Ghazi al-Din Haydar supported the British East India Company with a 10-million-rupee loan. Although its principal did not have to be repaid, the loan's five-percent annual interest had to be applied to specific objects (including four women: Nawwab Mubarak Mahal, Sultan Maryam Begam, Mumtaz Mahal, and Sarfaraz Mahal, who received 10,000, 2,500, 1,100 and 1,000 rupees per month respectively). Others, including servants and associates of Sarfaraz Mahal, were to receive 929 rupees. After the women's deaths, two-thirds of the allowance (or all of it in case of \"intestacy\") would be given to mujtahids in Najaf and Karbala for it to reach \"deserving persons\". This financial aid was known as the Oudh Bequest.\nThe maximum amount the cities could receive was 186,148 rupees, when one British pound equalled about 10 rupees. The first portion of the Oudh Bequest reached Najaf and Karbala around 1850, after Maryam Begam and Sultan Mahal's deaths. About 120,000 rupees (£10,000) annually reached the cities by the end of the 1850s.\n## Administration\nFrom its beginning in 1850, two Iraqi religious leaders (Sayyid Ali Naqi al-Tabatabie and Morteza Ansari) transferred the bequest from India through agents. Morteza Ansari had devised a mode of distribution which included \"junior mujtahids, low-ranking indigent ulama, Persian and Arab students, the custodians of the shrines, and the poor.\" Although Ansari was involved in the bequest's distribution, he withdrew in 1860 \"presumably\" to avoid a close relationship with the British and was replaced by Sayid Ali Bahr al-Ulum as the distributor for Najaf. Bahr al-Ulum and al-Tabatabie made the distributions until 1903.\nThat year, on the eve of the Persian Constitutional Revolution, the British became involved in distributing the bequest. It was decided by the Indian government to change the distribution system because of allegations of misuse. Under the new system, the fund was distributed by British agents in the two cities to a group of ten mujtahids in each city. Although the alleged misuse was the rationale behind the distribution-system change, another factor may have been a British goal to influence Iranian politics through the shrine cities' ulama. A few opposed the bequest's British involvement, but many ulama \"benefited\" from it. In 1912 the British took over the bequest's distribution, shifting from a policy of leverage in Iran to \"acquiring goodwill\" from the Shia Muslims in India and \"enhancing their prestige\" in Iraq.\n## British political usage\nArthur Henry Hardinge, the British consul general in Tehran at the time, called the Oudh Bequest a \"powerful lever\" for promoting \"good relations\" with him and the Persian clerics. According to the British, the bequest was \"a means to enhance their influence over the ulama in Iran\" enabling the British to establish Ottoman territory and Qajar Iran as \"buffer zones to protect British India\". To use this \"leverage\", two British officials (Ramsay and Lorimer) tried to give more power to British residents of Baghdad by persuading the Indian government between 1909 and 1911. Najaf and Karbala ulamas were encouraged to interfere in Iranian internal affairs.

{"name": "Locard's exchange principle", "documents": ["# Locard's exchange principle\nIn forensic science, Locard's principle holds that the perpetrator of a crime will bring something into the crime scene and leave with something from it, and that both can be used as forensic evidence. Dr. Edmond Locard (1877–1966) was a pioneer in forensic science who became known as the Sherlock Holmes of Lyon, France. He formulated the basic principle of forensic science as: \"Every contact leaves a trace\". It is generally understood as \"with contact between two items, there will be an exchange.\" Paul L. Kirk expressed the principle as follows:\nWherever he steps, whatever he touches, whatever he leaves, even unconsciously, will serve as a silent witness against him. Not only his fingerprints or his footprints, but his hair, the fibres from his clothes, the glass he breaks, the tool mark he leaves, the paint he scratches, the blood or semen he deposits or collects. All of these and more, bear mute witness against him. This is evidence that does not forget. It is not confused by the excitement of the moment. It is not absent because human witnesses are. It is factual evidence. Physical evidence cannot be wrong, it cannot perjure itself, it cannot be wholly absent. Only human failure to find it, study and understand it, can diminish its value.\nFragmentary or trace evidence is any type of material left at (or taken from) a crime scene, or the result of contact between two surfaces, such as shoes and the floor covering or soil, or fibres from where someone sat on an upholstered chair.\nWhen a crime is committed, fragmentary (or trace) evidence needs to be collected from the scene. A team of specialised police technicians goes to the scene of the crime and seals it off. They record video and take photographs of the crime scene, victim/s (if there are any) and items of evidence. If necessary, they undertake ballistics examinations. They check for foot, shoe, and tire mark impressions, plus hair as well as examine any vehicles and check for fingerprints – whole or partial.\n## Famous cases\nThe case studies below show how prevalent Locard's Exchange Principle is in each and every crime. The examples using Locard's Principle show not only how the transfer of trace evidence can tell the tale of what happened, but also how much care is required when collecting and evaluating trace evidence.\n### The Weimar children murders\nKarola and Melanie Weimar, aged 5 and 7, lived with their parents, Reinhard and Monika, in Germany. They were reported missing on 4 August 1986. Their bodies were found on 7 August. They had been murdered.\nMonika first said the children had breakfast, then went to a playground. Three weeks later she said they were already dead when she returned home the previous night: Reinhard was sitting on the edge of Karola's bed, weeping and confused; he then disposed of the bodies.\nBoth parents were suspected, but Monika was having an affair, and was seen where Melanie's body was later found. She was convicted, and after serving her sentence, was released in 2006.\nInvestigators determined what clothes Monika was wearing on 3 and 4 August, but not Reinhard's clothes, so only fibres from her clothing were identified on the children's bodies, yet they were also constantly in contact with him.\nThe bedding contained 14 fibres from Karola's T-shirt. Frictionless tests, simulating a dead child, matched that figure better than the friction tests, simulating a live child, so Karola could have lain lifelessly in bed wearing her T-shirt, as stated by her mother.\n35 fibres from Monika's blouse were found on the back of Melanie's T-shirt, but only one on her bed sheet. In tests, between 6 and 10 fibres remained on the sheet. These higher numbers were thought to disprove Monika's claim that she gave her child a goodbye hug the previous day. However, there are several likely explanations. For example, the bedding was put in one bag, so fibres from the sheet could have been transferred to the cover and pillow. Only the central area of the top of the sheet was taped: it might have originally contained more than one blouse fibre, the others could have been transferred to the back or sides while in the bag.\nThe blouse fibres on Melanie's clothing were distributed evenly, not the clusters expected from carrying the body.\n265 fibres from the family car's rear seat covers were found on Melanie's panties and the inside of her trousers, but only a small number of fibres from the front seats was found on the children. This helped disprove the theory that they were killed on the front seats.\nMelanie's clothes and hair were covered in 375 clinging fruits of goosegrass. As some of these itchy things were on the inside of her trousers and on her panties, the trousers must have been put on her after death.\nNo sand was found on the bodies or clothing (including socks and sandals) of either child, making the morning playground story unlikely.\n### The Westerfield-van Dam case\nDanielle van Dam, aged 7, lived with her parents and brothers in San Diego, California. She was reported missing on 2 February 2002; her body was discovered on 27 February. Neighbor David Westerfield was almost immediately suspected, as he had gone camping in his RV, and he was convicted of her kidnapping.\nHairs consistent with the van Dams' dog were found in his RV, also carpet fibres consistent with Danielle's bedroom carpet. Danielle's nightly ritual was to wrestle with the dog after getting into her pajamas. The prosecution argued that those hairs and fibres got onto her pajamas through that contact, and were then carried on the pajamas to first Westerfield's house and then to his RV, when he kidnapped her from her bed. The alternative scenario is that they got onto her daytime clothes, and those of her mother and younger brother, and were carried to his house when they visited him earlier that week selling cookies. He said his laundry was out during that visit, so trace evidence from them could have got on it, and then been transferred to his bedroom and his RV (secondary Locard transfer). Also, his RV was often parked, sometimes unlocked, in the neighbourhood streets, so Danielle could have sneaked inside, leaving behind that evidence.\nNo trace of Westerfield was found in the van Dam house.\n14 hairs consistent with Danielle's were found in his environment. All but one were compared on only mitochondrial DNA, so they might have come from her mother or a sibling. Most (21) of the hairs were in a dryer lint ball in his trash can, so they might have got in his laundry before the kidnapping.\nThere were 5 carpet fibres in his RV, but none in his house, suggesting those were deposited by someone going directly from her house to his RV, or they may have come from another house in that development.\nNo Danielle pajama or bedding fibres were reported in his environment. There was no trace evidence in his SUV (which casts doubt on the belief that she was transported from his house to his RV in his SUV). He vacuumed his RV after the kidnapping, but no trace evidence was in the vacuum cleaner.\nOne orange fibre with her body was consistent with about 200 in his house and 20 in his SUV (none in his RV), while 21 blue fibres with her body were consistent with 10 in his house and 46 in his RV (none in his SUV). Contrary to media reports, only a few items from her house were tested so that can't be excluded as the source. In particular, the clothes of Danielle and her family during the cookie sale were not determined and eliminated. There were apparently two different types of the orange fibres, dull and very bright (so the number which matched might have been much less than 200). There were red fibres with her fingernails, and many other fibres with her body, which could not be matched to his environment. The only non-Danielle hair found with her body wasn't his, nor was any desert sand reported with the body, and no soil or vegetation from the dump site was reported on his shoes, laundry, shovel or RV.\nTo explain why so much expected evidence was missing, the prosecution argued that he went on a cleaning frenzy, and tossed out evidence.\n## Application in Information Security\nLocard's Principle also holds in computer forensics, where committing cyber crime will result in a digital trace being left behind."], "selected_questions": ["Who is Dr. Edmond Locard and what is his contribution to forensic science?", "What is Locard's exchange principle and how is it generally understood?", "What is the Westerfield-van Dam case and how was Locard's principle applied in the investigation?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["Dr. Edmond Locard was a pioneer in forensic science, often referred to as the \"Sherlock Holmes of Lyon, France\".

He established the first forensic science laboratory in France in 1910, which became a model for other forensic science laboratories around the world.\n\nDr. Locard's contributions to forensic science are numerous. In addition to the Locard Exchange Principle, he developed a number of techniques for analyzing trace evidence, including the use of microscopy and chemical analysis. He also played a key role in the development of forensic anthropology, which involves the use of skeletal remains to identify individuals and determine the cause of death.\n\nOverall, Dr. Locard's work has had a profound impact on the field of forensic science, and his contributions continue to be recognized and used by forensic scientists around the world.", "Locard's exchange principle is a concept in forensic science that states that every contact between two objects leaves a trace. This means that when two objects come into contact with each other, they exchange material, such as fibers, hairs, or skin cells. This exchange can be used as evidence to link a suspect to a crime scene or to establish a connection between two seemingly unrelated events.\n\nThe principle is generally understood as a fundamental concept in forensic science, and it is used in a wide range of investigations, from homicides to burglaries to drug trafficking. It is based on the idea that every contact leaves a trace, and that these traces can be used to reconstruct events and establish connections between people, places, and things.\n\nLocard's exchange principle is often used in conjunction with other forensic techniques, such as DNA analysis, fingerprinting, and ballistics analysis, to build a case against a suspect. It is a powerful tool in the hands of forensic investigators, and it has helped to solve countless crimes over the years.", "The Westerfield-van Dam case was a high-profile criminal investigation that occurred in San Diego, California in 2002. The case involved the disappearance and murder of a young girl named Danielle van Dam, and the subsequent arrest and trial of her neighbor, David Westerfield.\n\nLocard's principle, also known as the principle of exchange, states that every contact between two objects leaves a trace. This principle was applied in the Westerfield-van Dam case by investigators who searched for and collected evidence that might link Westerfield to the crime.\n\nFor example, investigators found fibers from Westerfield's motorhome on Danielle's clothing, and fibers from Danielle's clothing in Westerfield's motorhome. They also found Danielle's DNA on a jacket that Westerfield owned, and Westerfield's DNA on a hair found on Danielle's body.\n\nThese pieces of evidence were crucial in building the case against Westerfield, and ultimately led to his conviction for the murder of Danielle van Dam. The application of Locard's principle helped investigators to connect Westerfield to the crime scene and to the victim, and provided strong evidence that he was responsible for her death."], "human_GPT3.5_answers_D_ann": [["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> Dr. Edmond Locard (1877–1966) was a pioneer in forensic science who became known as the Sherlock Holmes of Lyon, France", "<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> He formulated the basic principle of forensic science as: \"Every contact leaves a trace\"<SEP> Locard's principle holds that the perpetrator of a crime will bring something into the crime scene and leave with something from it, and that both can be used as forensic evidence", "<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> He formulated the basic principle of forensic science as: \"Every contact leaves a trace\"<SEP> It is generally understood as \"with contact between two items, there will be an exchange"], ["<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> Locard's exchange principle holds that the perpetrator of a crime will bring something into the crime scene and leave with something from it, and that both can be used as forensic evidence", "<Hallucination> None\n<Reference> It is generally understood as \"with contact between two items, there will be an exchange<SEP> 2.

The weighting factors are 0.43 for the cold start and transient phases together and 0.57 for the hot start phase.\nThough it was originally created as a reference point for fossil fuelled vehicles, the UDDS and thus the FTP-75, are also used to estimate the range in distance travelled by an electric vehicle in a single charge.\n### Deceptions\nIt is alleged that, similarly than in the NEDC, some automakers overinflate tyres, adjusting or disconnecting brakes to reduce friction, and taping cracks between body panels and windows to reduce air resistance, some go as far as removing wing mirrors, to inflate measured fuel economy and lower measured carbon emission.\nIn addition, it has been brought to attention that the relative height of the simulated wind fan with respect to the vehicle could alter the performance of aftertreatment systems due to changes in temperature and, consequently, modify the pollutant emissions values.\n## Highway driving\nThe \"highway\" program or Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule (HWFET) is defined in 40 CFR 600.I.\nIt uses a warmed-up engine and makes no stops, averaging 48 mph (77 km/h) with a top speed of 60 mph (97 km/h) over a 10-mile (16 km) distance.\nThe following are some characteristic parameters of the cycle:\nDuration: 765 seconds Total distance: 10.26 miles (16.45 km) Average Speed: 48.3 mph (77.7 km/h)\nBefore the 5-cycle fuel economy estimates were introduced in 2006 the measurements were adjusted downward by 10% (city) and 22% (highway) to more accurately reflect real-world results.\n## Supplemental tests\nIn 2007, the EPA added three new Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP) tests that combine the current city and highway cycles to reflect real world fuel economy more accurately,. Estimates are available for vehicles back to the 1985 model year.\n### US06\nThe US06 Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP) was developed to address the shortcomings with the FTP-75 test cycle in the representation of aggressive, high speed and/or high acceleration driving behavior, rapid speed fluctuations, and driving behavior following startup.\nSFTP US06 is a high speed/quick acceleration loop that lasts 10 minutes, covers 8 miles (13 km), averages 48 mph (77 km/h) and reaches a top speed of 80 mph (130 km/h). Four stops are included, and brisk acceleration maximizes at a rate of 8.46 mph (13.62 km/h) per second. The engine begins warm and air conditioning is not used. Ambient temperature varies between 68 °F (20 °C) to 86 °F (30 °C).\nThe cycle represents an 8.01 mile (12.8 km) route with an average speed of 48.4 miles/h (77.9 km/h), maximum speed 80.3 miles/h (129.2 km/h), and a duration of 596 seconds.\n### SC03\nThe SC03 Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP) has been introduced to represent the engine load and emissions associated with the use of air conditioning units in vehicles certified over the FTP-75 test cycle.\nSFTO SC03 is the air conditioning test, which raises ambient temperatures to 95 °F (35 °C), and puts the vehicle's climate control system to use. Lasting 9.9 minutes, the 3.6-mile (5.8 km) loop averages 22 mph (35 km/h) and maximizes at a rate of 54.8 mph (88.2 km/h). Five stops are included, idling occurs 19 percent of the time and acceleration of 5.1 mph/sec is achieved. Engine temperatures begin warm.\nThe cycle represents a 3.6 mile (5.8 km) route with an average speed of 21.6 miles/h (34.8 km/h), maximum speed 54.8 miles/h (88.2 km/h), and a duration of 596 seconds.\n### Cold cycle\nA cold temperature cycle uses the same parameters as the current city loop, except that ambient temperature is set to 20 °F (−7 °C).\n## EPA fuel economy sticker\nEPA tests for fuel economy do not include electrical load tests beyond climate control, which may account for some of the discrepancy between EPA and real world fuel-efficiency.

{"name": "Automated trading system", "documents": ["# Automated trading system\nAn automated trading system (ATS), a subset of algorithmic trading, uses a computer program to create buy and sell orders and automatically submits the orders to a market center or exchange. The computer program will automatically generate orders based on predefined set of rules using a trading strategy which is based on technical analysis, advanced statistical and mathematical computations or input from other electronic sources.\nAutomated trading systems are often used with electronic trading in automated market centers, including electronic communication networks, \"dark pools\", and automated exchanges. Automated trading systems and electronic trading platforms can execute repetitive tasks at speeds orders of magnitude greater than any human equivalent. Traditional risk controls and safeguards that relied on human judgment are not appropriate for automated trading and this has caused issues such as the 2010 Flash Crash. New controls such as trading curbs or 'circuit breakers' have been put in place in some electronic markets to deal with automated trading systems.\n## Mechanism\nThe automated trading system determines whether an order should be submitted based on, for example, the current market price of an option and theoretical buy and sell prices. The theoretical buy and sell prices are derived from, among other things, the current market price of the security underlying the option. A look-up table stores a range of theoretical buy and sell prices for a given range of current market price of the underlying security. Accordingly, as the price of the underlying security changes, a new theoretical price may be indexed in the look-up table, thereby avoiding calculations that would otherwise slow automated trading decisions. A distributed processing on-line automated trading system uses structured messages to represent each stage in the negotiation between a market maker (quoter) and a potential buyer or seller (requestor).\n## Advantages of Automated Trading System\nMinimizes Emotion\nAs orders are processed automatically once the pre-set rules are satisfied, emotional mistakes are minimized. It also helps traders to stay disciplined when the market is highly volatile.\nAbility to Backtest\nBefore actually using the automated trading or the underlying algorithm, traders are able to evaluate their rules using the old data. It allows the traders to minimize potential mistakes and determine the expected returns.\nAchieves Consistency\nAs orders are processed only when the pre-set rules are satisfied and traders only trade by plan, it helps the traders achieve consistency.\nImproved Order Entry Speed\nAs computers process the orders as soon as the pre-set rules are met, it achieves higher order entry speed which is extremely beneficial in the current market where market conditions can change very rapidly.\nDiversifies Trading\nAutomated trading systems allow users to simultaneously trade in multiple accounts which allows them to diversify their portfolio. Diversifying the portfolio allows the users to minimize their risks by spreading the risk over various instruments.\n## Disadvantages of Automated Trading System\nMechanical Failures\nEven though the underlying algorithm is capable of performing well in the live market, an internet connection malfunction could lead to a failure.\nMonitoring\nAlthough the computer is processing the orders, it still needs to be monitored because it is susceptible to technology failures as shown above.\nOver-Optimization\nAn algorithm that performs very well on backtesting could end up performing very poorly in the live market. Good performance on backtesting could lead to overly optimistic expectations from the traders which could lead to big failures.\n## Strategies\nTrend following\n\"The most common strategy which is implemented by following the trend in moving averages, channel breakouts, price level movements, and related technical indicators\".\nFor example, the following formula could be used for trend following strategy:\nVolume-weighted average price\n\"Volume weighted average price strategy breaks up a large order and releases dynamically determined smaller chunks of the order to the market using stock-specific historical volume profiles.\"\nAccording to Volume-weighted average price Wikipedia page, VWAP is calculated using the following formula:\n\": P V W A P = ∑ j P j ⋅ Q j ∑ j Q j {\\displaystyle P_{\\mathrm {VWAP} }={\\frac {\\sum _{j}{P_{j}\\cdot Q_{j}}}{\\sum _{j}{Q_{j}}}}\\,}\nwhere:\nMean reversion (finance)\nThis strategy is based on the idea that the values/prices of assets will revert to their mean prices/values.\n\"A continuous mean-reverting time series can be represented by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic differential equation:\nWhere θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } is the rate of reversion to the mean, μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } is the mean value of the process, σ {\\displaystyle \\sigma } is the variance of the process and W t {\\displaystyle W_{t}} is a Wiener Process or Brownian Motion\".\n## History\nThe concept of automated trading system was first introduced by Richard Donchian in 1949 when he used a set of rules to buy and sell the funds. Then, in the 1980s, the concept of rule based trading became more popular when famous traders like John Henry began to use such strategies. In the mid 1990s, some models were available for purchase. Also, improvements in technology increased the accessibility for retail investors. The early form of an Automated Trading System, composed of software based on algorithms, that have historically been used by financial managers and brokers. This type of software was used to automatically manage clients' portfolios. However, the first service to free market without any supervision was first launched in 2008 which was Betterment by Jon Stein. Since then, this system has been improving with the development in the IT industry. Now, Automated Trading System is managing huge assets all around the globe. In 2014, more than 75 percent of the stock shares traded on United States exchanges (including the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ) originated from automated trading system orders.\n## Applications\nHow it Works\nAutomated trading system can be based on a predefined set of rules which determine when to enter an order, when to exit a position, and how much money to invest in each trading product. Trading strategies differ such that while some are designed to pick market tops and bottoms, others follow a trend, and others involve complex strategies including randomizing orders to make them less visible in the marketplace. ATSs allow a trader to execute orders much quicker and to manage their portfolio easily by automatically generating protective precautions.\nBacktesting\nBacktesting of a trading system involves programmers running the program by using historical market data in order to determine whether the underlying algorithm can produce the expected results. Backtesting software enables a trading system designer to develop and test their trading systems by using historical market data and optimizing the results obtained with the historical data. Although backtesting of automated trading systems cannot accurately determine future results, an automated trading system can be backtested by using historical prices to see how the system would have performed theoretically if it had been active in a past market environment.\nForward Testing\nForward testing of an algorithm can also be achieved using simulated trading with real-time market data to help confirm the effectiveness of the trading strategy in the current market. It may be used to reveal issues inherent in the computer code.\nLive Testing\nLive testing is the final stage of the development cycle. In this stage, live performance is compared against the backtested and walk forward results. Metrics compared include Percent Profitable, Profit Factor, Maximum Drawdown and Average Gain per Trade. The goal of an automated trading system is to meet or exceed the backtested performance with a high efficiency rating.\n## Market disruption and manipulation\nAutomated trading, or high-frequency trading, causes regulatory concerns as a contributor to market fragility. United States regulators have published releases discussing several types of risk controls that could be used to limit the extent of such disruptions, including financial and regulatory controls to prevent the entry of erroneous orders as a result of computer malfunction or human error, the breaching of various regulatory requirements, and exceeding a credit or capital limit.\nThe use of high-frequency trading (HFT) strategies has grown substantially over the past several years and drives a significant portion of activity on U.S. markets. Although many HFT strategies are legitimate, some are not and may be used for manipulative trading. A strategy would be illegitimate or even illegal if it causes deliberate disruption in the market or tries to manipulate it. Such strategies include \"momentum ignition strategies\": spoofing and layering where a market participant places a non-bona fide order on one side of the market (typically, but not always, above the offer or below the bid) in an attempt to bait other market participants to react to the non-bona fide order and then trade with another order on the other side of the market. They are also referred to as predatory/abusive strategies. Given the scale of the potential impact that these practices may have, the surveillance of abusive algorithms remains a high priority for regulators. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has reminded firms using HFT strategies and other trading algorithms of their obligation to be vigilant when testing these strategies pre- and post-launch to ensure that the strategies do not result in abusive trading.\nFINRA also focuses on the entry of problematic HFT and algorithmic activity through sponsored participants who initiate their activity from outside of the United States. In this regard, FINRA reminds firms of their surveillance and control obligations under the SEC's Market Access Rule and Notice to Members 04-66, as well as potential issues related to treating such accounts as customer accounts, anti-money laundering, and margin levels as highlighted in Regulatory Notice 10-18  and the SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examination's National Exam Risk Alert dated September 29, 2011.\nFINRA conducts surveillance to identify cross-market and cross-product manipulation of the price of underlying equity securities. Such manipulations are done typically through abusive trading algorithms or strategies that close out pre-existing option positions at favorable prices or establish new option positions at advantageous prices.\nIn recent years, there have been a number of algorithmic trading malfunctions that caused substantial market disruptions. These raise concern about firms' ability to develop, implement, and effectively supervise their automated systems. FINRA has stated that it will assess whether firms' testing and controls related to algorithmic trading and other automated trading strategies are adequate in light of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and firms' supervisory obligations. This assessment may take the form of examinations and targeted investigations. Firms will be required to address whether they conduct separate, independent, and robust pre-implementation testing of algorithms and trading systems. Also, whether the firm's legal, compliance, and operations staff are reviewing the design and development of the algorithms and trading systems for compliance with legal requirements will be investigated. FINRA will review whether a firm actively monitors and reviews algorithms and trading systems once they are placed into production systems and after they have been modified, including procedures and controls used to detect potential trading abuses such as wash sales, marking, layering, and momentum ignition strategies. Finally, firms will need to describe their approach to firm-wide disconnect or \"kill\" switches, as well as procedures for responding to catastrophic system malfunctions.\n### Notable examples\nExamples of recent substantial market disruptions include the following:\nOn May 6, 2010, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined about 1,000 points (about 9 percent) and recovered those losses within minutes. It was the second-largest point swing (1,010.14 points) and the largest one-day point decline (998.5 points) on an intraday basis in the Average's history. This market disruption became known as the Flash Crash and resulted in U.S. regulators issuing new regulations to control market access achieved through automated trading. On August 1, 2012, between 9:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. EDT, Knight Capital Group lost four times its 2011 net income. Knight's CEO Thomas Joyce stated, on the day after the market disruption, that the firm had \"all hands on deck\" to fix a bug in one of Knight's trading algorithms that submitted erroneous orders to exchanges for nearly 150 different stocks. Trading volumes soared in so many issues, that the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SYMBOL: SPY), which is generally the most heavily traded U.S. security, became the 52nd-most traded stock on that day, according to Eric Hunsader, CEO of market data service Nanex. Knight shares closed down 62 percent as a result of the trading error and Knight Capital nearly collapsed. Knight ultimately reached an agreement to merge with Getco, a Chicago-based high-speed trading firm."], "selected_questions": ["What is an automated trading system and how is it related to algorithmic trading?", "What is the trend following strategy in an automated trading system and how is it implemented?", "What is backtesting in the context of an automated trading system and what does it involve?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["", "The trend following strategy in an automated trading system is the most common strategy implemented by following the trend in moving averages, channel breakouts, price level movements, and related technical indicators.

Believing that Westley is dead, since the Dread Pirate Roberts is famous for not taking captives, Buttercup sinks into despair. Years later, she reluctantly agrees to marry Prince Humperdinck, heir to the throne of Florin.\nBefore the wedding, a trio of outlaws — the Sicilian criminal genius Vizzini, the Spanish fencing master Inigo Montoya, and the enormous and mighty Turkish wrestler Fezzik — kidnap Buttercup. A masked man in black follows them across the sea and up the Cliffs of Insanity, after which Vizzini orders Inigo to stop the pursuer. Before the man in black reaches the top of the cliff, a flashback of Inigo's past reveals that he is seeking revenge on a six-fingered man who had killed Inigo's father. When the man in black arrives, Inigo challenges him to a duel. The man in black wins the duel but leaves the Spaniard alive. Vizzini then orders Fezzik to kill the man in black. A flashback showed Fezzik as a lonely boy who was \"accepted\" by Vizzini. His conscience compelling him to fair play, Fezzik throws a rock as a warning to the man in black and challenges him to a wrestling match. The man in black accepts the challenge and chokes Fezzik until the giant blacks out. The man in black then catches up with Vizzini and proposes a Battle of the Wits, challenging Vizzini to guess which of two cups of wine is poisoned with iocane powder. They drink, and Vizzini dies. The man in black then explains to Buttercup that he had poisoned both cups, having built up an immunity to iocane powder beforehand.\nWith Prince Humperdinck's rescue party in hot pursuit, the man in black flees with Buttercup. He taunts Buttercup, claiming that women cannot be trusted and that she must have felt nothing when her true love and sweetheart died. She shoves him into a gorge, yelling, \"You can die, too, for all I care!\" and hears him call, \"As you wish!\" from the bottom of the ravine. She realizes he is Westley and follows him down into the gorge, to find him battered but largely unhurt. They travel through the Fire Swamp to evade Humperdinck's party. At Buttercup's insistence, Westley tells Buttercup about his experience with the Dread Pirate Roberts and how he secretly became the latest in a line of men to use that identity.\nThe Fire Swamp has many obstacles, such as Snow Sand and Rodents of Unusual Size (R.O.U.S., /ruːs/, ROOS). Westley and Buttercup successfully navigate the Fire Swamp, but they are captured by Prince Humperdinck and his cruel six-fingered assistant, Count Tyrone Rugen. Buttercup negotiates for Westley's release and returns with Humperdinck to the palace to await their wedding. Rugen follows Humperdinck's secret instructions not to release Westley, but to take him to his underground hunting arena, the \"Zoo of Death\". Here, Rugen tortures and weakens Westley with his life-sucking invention, The Machine.\nMeanwhile, Buttercup has nightmares regarding her marriage to the prince. She expresses her unhappiness to Humperdinck, who proposes that he send ships to locate Westley, but that if they fail to find him, Buttercup will marry him. The novel reveals that, to start a war with the neighboring country of Guilder, Humperdinck himself had arranged Buttercup's kidnapping and murder, but that he now believes that Buttercup dying on her wedding night will inspire his subjects to fight more effectively.\nOn the day of the wedding, Inigo meets again with Fezzik, who tells him that Count Rugen is the six-fingered man who killed his father. Knowing that Vizzini is dead, they seek out the man in black hoping that his wits will help them plan a successful attack on the castle to find and kill Count Rugen. Buttercup learns that Humperdinck never sent any ships, and taunts him with her enduring love for Westley. Enraged, Humperdinck tortures Westley to death via The Machine. Westley's screams echo across the land, drawing Inigo and Fezzik to the Zoo of Death. Finding Westley's body, they enlist the help of a magician named Miracle Max who had been fired by Humperdinck. Max pronounces Westley to be mere \"mostly dead\", and returns him to life (out of a desire to get back at Humperdinck), though Westley remains partially paralyzed and weak.\nWestley devises a plan to invade the castle during the wedding, and the commotion caused by this prompts Humperdinck to cut the wedding short. Buttercup decides to commit suicide when she reaches the honeymoon suite. Inigo pursues Rugen through the castle and kills him in a sword fight. Westley reaches Buttercup before she commits suicide. Still partially paralyzed, Westley bluffs his way out of a sword fight with Humperdinck, who shows himself as a coward. Instead of killing his rival, Westley decides to leave him alive. The party then rides off into the sunset on four of the prince's purebred white horses. The story ends with a series of mishaps and the prince's men closing in, but the author indicates that he believes that the group got away.\n## Context\nThis novel includes several narrative techniques or literary devices including a fictional frame story about how Goldman came to know about and decided to adapt S. Morgenstern's The Princess Bride. In Goldman's \"footnotes,\" he describes how his father used to read The Princess Bride aloud to him; thus the book became Goldman's favorite without him ever actually reading the text. As a father, Goldman looked forward to sharing the story with his own son, going to great lengths to locate a copy for his son's birthday, only to be crushed when his son stops reading after the first chapter. When Goldman revisits the book himself, he discovers that what he believed was a straightforward adventure novel was in fact a bitter satire of politics in Morgenstern's native Florin, and that his father had been skipping all the political commentary and leaving in only \"the good parts.\" This moves Goldman to abridge the book to a version resembling the one his father had read to him, while adding notes to summarize material he had \"removed.\" Morgenstern and the \"original version\" are fictitious and used as a literary device to comment on the nature of adaptation and to draw a contrast between the love and adventure of the main story and the mundane aspects of everyday life. The nations of Guilder and Florin are likewise pure fiction.\nThe narrator of The Princess Bride, while named William Goldman, is persona or author surrogate that mixes fictional elements with some biographical details that match the author's life. Goldman's personal life, as described in the introduction and commentary in the novel, is fictional. In The Princess Bride, Goldman claimed to have one son with his wife, Helen, a psychiatrist. In reality, Goldman married Ilene Jones, a photographer, in 1961. They had two daughters named Jenny and Susanna, and they divorced in 1991. Goldman's commentary contains references to his real-life Hollywood career, including the observation that the famous cliff scene in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was likely inspired by the Cliffs of Insanity from The Princess Bride. While Goldman did write the screenplay for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in 1969, it is unclear if all the career references have a basis in truth. The commentary is extensive, continuing through the text until the end.\nThe book's actual roots are in stories Goldman told to his daughters (aged 7 and 4), one of whom had requested a story about \"princesses\" and the other \"brides\". Goldman describes the earliest character names from the \"kid's saga\" as \"silly names: Buttercup, Humperdinck\". The countries are both named after coins. The florin was originally an Italian gold coin minted in Florence, and later the name of various currencies and denominations. The guilder was originally a Dutch gold coin, and later the name of various currencies used mainly in the Netherlands and its territories. The two names are often interchangeable.\nGoldman said he wrote the first chapter about Buttercup which ran for about 20 pages. Then, he wrote the second chapter, \"The Groom\", about the man she was going to marry; Goldman only managed to write four pages before running dry. Then he got the idea to write an abridged novel:\nAnd when that idea hit, everything changed. Tennessee Williams says there are three or four days when you are writing a play that the piece opens itself to you, and the good parts of the play are all from those days. Well, The Princess Bride opened itself to me. I never had a writing experience like it. I went back and wrote the chapter about Bill Goldman being at the Beverly Hills Hotel and it all just came out. I never felt as strongly connected emotionally to any writing of mine in my life. It was totally new and satisfying and it came as such a contrast to the world I had been doing in the films that I wanted to be a novelist again.\nGoldman said he was particularly moved writing the scene in which Westley dies.\n### Reunion scene\nIn the novel's commentary, Goldman writes that he added nothing to the \"original\" Morgenstern text. He did write one original scene, a loving reunion between Buttercup and Westley, but, he said, his publisher objected to this addition. He invites any reader who wants to read the \"Reunion Scene\" to write to the publisher (formerly Harcourt Brace Jovanovich; now Random House) and request a copy. Many readers wrote in to the publisher and did receive a letter, but instead of an extra scene, the letter detailed the (obviously fictitious) legal problems that Goldman and his publishers encountered with the Morgenstern estate and its lawyer, Kermit Shog. This letter was revised and updated periodically; the 1987 revision mentioned the movie, while the 25th Anniversary Edition published the letter with an addendum about Kermit's lawyer granddaughter Carly. The 30th Anniversary Edition has a footnote that the three pages of the reunion scene were now available online. However, the website itself contained nothing but the text of the original three letters. This website has since been taken down and superseded by the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt product page for the book, which provides the 2003 version of the Reunion Scene letter as a digital download.\n## Buttercup's Baby\nThe epilogue to some later editions of the novel, notably the 25th anniversary edition, mentions a sequel, Buttercup's Baby, that was \"having trouble getting published because of legal difficulties with S. Morgenstern's estate\". Later editions actually reprint Goldman's \"sample chapter\".\nThe chapter consists of a disjointed assemblage of stories about the quartet's escape to \"One Tree Island\", and the eventual kidnapping of Waverly (Westley and Buttercup's daughter) by a skinless-faced \"madman\" who eventually throws her off a mountainside. The chapter ends with Fezzik, Waverly's appointed babysitter, leaping off the mountain to save her, and then cradling her to preserve her from the impact that seems certain to spell at least Fezzik's doom. Also noteworthy is a flashback to Inigo's past, his training as a swordsman, and his one-time romantic love interest.\nThe chapter also continues the author's extensive footnotes after he is outraged to learn that the fiercely protective Morgenstern estate had finally relented to an abridgment of Buttercup's Baby done not by Goldman but by author Stephen King. The footnotes detail Goldman's visit to the fictional nation of Florin, which houses a popular museum devoted to the \"real\" story of The Princess Bride and contains such artifacts as Inigo's six-fingered sword.\nThe 30th anniversary edition of The Princess Bride included hints to the sequel's plot, and a promise to have the full version completed before a 50th anniversary edition (2023).\nIn a January 2007 interview, Goldman admitted he was having difficulty coming up with ideas for the story:\nMPM: I hear you're working on a sequel to The Princess Bride called Buttercup's Baby. William Goldman: I desperately want to write it, and I sit there and nothing happens and I get pissed at myself. I got lucky with The Princess Bride the first time, and I'd love to get lucky again.\nGoldman died in 2018 without having completed the sequel.\n## Adaptations\nIn 1982 Ray Harryhausen was approached by British producer Milton Subotsky, who had written a script based on the novel. Harryhausen liked the book, but found too many problems with the screenplay. He and Subotsky worked together in an attempt to create a new script, but eventually gave up.\nThe book was adapted into a 1987 feature film directed by Rob Reiner from a screenplay written by Goldman himself.\nGoldman partnered with Adam Guettel to create a musical version of the story with Goldman writing the book and Guettel writing the music, but the two parted ways on the project when Goldman demanded 75% of the author's royalties, though Guettel was writing both the music and the lyrics. Guettel's score was nearly complete, but it is unlikely to be heard beyond an orchestral suite performed at the Hollywood Bowl in 2006.\nIn November 2013, Disney Theatrical announced that it will be staging a new stage musical version, based on the novel and film screenplay.\nIn 2008, Toy Vault, Inc. announced it was working on a Princess Bride–based card game due for release in the second quarter of 2008. It also announced that it is working on a board game, the second ever produced for this movie, after a simple board game included with some VHS releases.\nAlso in 2008, the production company Worldwide Biggies released a computer game, The Princess Bride Game. Several actors from the movie provided voices for their video game counterparts, including Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya, Wallace Shawn as Vizzini, and Robin Wright as Buttercup.\nSierra Online parodied the title of the novel in their computer game King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride.\nIn 2014, Game Salute licensed the tabletop game adaptation publishing rights to the Princess Bride; a series of board and card games were released later that year.\nIn 2019, Toy Vault produced a Role Playing Game written by Steffan O'Sullivan.\nOn September 13, 2020, the surviving members of the original cast participated in a live script reading that was a fundraiser for the Wisconsin Democratic Party.\nIn 2021, BBC Radio 4 produced a two-part radio adaptation by Stephen Keyworth (referred to as \"The Best Bits of the Good Parts Version\"), with the first part broadcast on Christmas Day 2021 and the second on New Year's Day 2022. During the week of 26 December 2021, five mini-episodes, \"Bitesize Backstories\", dealing with the backstories of the book itself and four of the main characters \"which can be enjoyed as stand-alone stories or to enhance  experience of the drama\", were also broadcast on BBC Radio 4."], "selected_questions": ["What narrative techniques or literary devices are included in The Princess Bride novel?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The Princess Bride novel includes the following narrative techniques and literary devices:\n1.

{"name": "Lincoln Thornton Manuscript", "documents": ["# Lincoln Thornton Manuscript\nThe Lincoln Thornton Manuscript is a medieval manuscript compiled and copied by the fifteenth-century English scribe and landowner Robert Thornton, MS 91 in the library of Lincoln Cathedral. The manuscript is notable for containing single versions of important poems such as the Alliterative Morte Arthure and Sir Perceval of Galles, and gives evidence of the variegated literary culture of fifteenth-century England. The manuscript contains three main sections: the first one contains mainly narrative poems (romances, for the most part); the second contains mainly religious poems and includes texts by Richard Rolle, giving evidence of works by that author which are now lost; and the third section contains a medical treatise, the Liber de diversis medicinis.\n## Manuscript\nThe Lincoln Thornton Manuscript (sometimes simply referred to as \"the\" Thornton manuscript) consists of seventeen quires of varying numbers of sheets. The manuscript is catalogued as Lincoln, Cathedral Library MS 91 (formerly A.5.2), and is held in the Lincoln Cathedral Library. It was written between 1430 and 1440 in a northern dialect.\nMost likely, Thornton prepared a number of quires and copied texts on them as they became available, and may have collected both his manuscripts out of the same collection of individual quires. Some quires show evidence of having been used or read independently before being bound together. For instance, the beginning of the Alliterative Morte Arthure (AMA), which starts quire d, has rounded edges and a \"faint grimy sheen,\" suggesting that this quire \"was left unbound for some time, absorbing the dust.\"\n## Contents\nThe texts in the manuscript fall into three main sections. The first (gatherings A-K) contains mainly romances interspersed with an occasional miscellaneous texts; the second (L-P) contains mainly religious texts; the third (Q) contains the Liber de diversis medicinis, a collection of medical lore.\nThe beginning of the manuscript is \"dominate\" by romances; the rest of the manuscript contains \"religious and medicinal tracts in prose and verse.\" The organization suggests the compiler's recognition of genre. The variety of genres found in the manuscript is deemed to be representative of what Edmund Spenser may have been influenced by in composing The Faerie Queene. Because of the different genres represented it has been termed a \"household miscellany.\"\n### Romance\nIn the list below, short miscellaneous texts are indented. Titles are represented as given by Brewer and Owen's facsimile edition.\nProse Life of Alexander (unique) \"Prognostication of weather\" Lamentacio Peccatoris (prologue to Adulterous Falmouth Squire) Morte Arthure (unique) The Romance of Octovyane The Romance of Sir Ysambrace The Romance of Dyoclicyane Vita Sancti Christofori Sir Degrevante Sir Eglamour De miraculo beate Marie Lyarde Thomas of Ersseldoune The Awentyrs of Arthure at the Terne Wathelyne The Romance off Sir Percyvelle of Gales (unique) \"Three Charms for Toothache\" Epistola Sancti Salvatoris A Preyere off the Ffyve Ioyes of oure lady ffyve prayers\n### Religion\nThis section contains, besides sermons, hymns, and prayer, a number of texts by Richard Rolle. Noteworthy also is The Previte off the Passioune, a translation of a text by Bonaventure.\nAmong the best known poems of the Manuscript is a poem on death later partially quoted by John Ball:\nWhen Adam dalfe and Eve spane, Go spire, if thou may spede, Whare was than the pride of mane, That nowe merres his mede? Of erthe and lame as was Adam, Makede to noye and nede. We er als he maked to be, Whilles we this lyfe salle ledenoye and nede. We er als he maked to be, Whilles we this lyfe salle lede\nAmong the archaisms of the poem \"spire\" means 'inquire', \"lame\" means loam, and \"noye\" to be vexed.\n### Medicine\nThe third section, consisting of quire q, contains Liber de diversis medicinis, a collection of medical advice and recipes. It is described as \"the usual mixture of genuine therapeutic lore and humbug\" and includes a recipe \"for to gare a woman say what þu askes hir.\" The text builds on both local, vernacular texts and \"the learned Latin recipe traditions.\"\n## Illuminations\nThe manuscript is illustrated with initials, with a comparatively great number found in the first two texts: the Prose Alexander (PA) has one large initial and a hundred and three smaller initials and the Alliterative Morte Arthure (AMA) has eighty-two small decorated initials. The PA also has nine blank spaces, left open for large initials or illustrations. This density is additional evidence that the quires containing these texts were separate booklets. While it was long assumed that Thornton had made the initials himself, Joel Fredell distinguished three distinctly different styles and argued they were made by professional artists. Fredell states that the PA was prepared for the richest illustrative program in the manuscript, which Thornton for a variety of reasons (financial and political) was not able to execute; he may not have had the money or the available resources in his area to complete it. The AMA was finished professionally, assuming second place in the intended ranking of the texts; and a lesser scheme was laid out for the other texts.\n## The compiler\nRobert Thornton was a member of the landed gentry in Yorkshire as well as an amateur scribe and collector. There are many mistakes in the manuscript, which is written in \"a fairly typical mid-fifteenth-century cursive hand.\" The name \"Robert Thornton\" is signed a few items, and the phrase R. Thornton dictus qui scripsit sit benedictus (\"May the said R. Thornton who wrote this be blessed\") occurs four times, and is also found in Thornton's other manuscript, the London Thornton Manuscript (London, British Library, Add. MS 31042).\n## Publication history\nThe manuscript was rediscovered in the nineteenth century. In 1866 and 1867, the religious texts in the Thornton manuscripts were published for the Early English Text Society (EETS). The Richard Rolle material was published at the end of the nineteenth century by Carl Horstmann. The Liber de Diversis Medicinis was published in 1938 by Margaret Ogden for the EETS. A facsimile of the manuscript was published in 1975 by Derek Brewer and A.E.B. Owen, who had disbound and examined it the year before. The facsimile was updated and reprinted in 1977.\n## Importance\nThe Lincoln Thornton MS and the London Thornton MS are of great value since they are the sole witnesses for much of their content; according to Michael Johnston, \"his two compilations can be counted among the most important textual witnesses to Middle English romance.\"\nDerek Brewer calculated that there must have been at least six now-lost manuscripts that provided the source material for the Thornton MS, which evidences a wide \"spread of manuscripts now lost.\" Sir Percyvelle, for instance, was originally composed in the fourteenth century in a north-east Midland dialect, and one version would have traveled north to be copied by Thornton while another traveled south to be referenced by Geoffrey Chaucer in Sir Thopas.\nThe manuscript is also seen as evidence of a change in religiosity taking place during the fifteenth century, when a broader dispersion of religious material began to make \"priestly mediation\" unnecessary. Its inclusion of a sermon by the Benedictine monk John Gaytryge is considered \"evidence of lay people taking responsibility for teaching themselves their 'catechism'....The laity were increasingly able to instruct themselves.\""], "selected_questions": ["What does the Lincoln Thornton Manuscript contain in terms of illuminations?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The Lincoln Thornton Manuscript contains initials and illustrations, with a relatively large number of them found in the first two texts: the Prose Alexander and the Alliterative Morte Arthure.

{"name": "Zamoyski Academy", "documents": ["# Zamoyski Academy\nThe Zamoyski Academy (Polish: Akademia Zamojska; Latin: Hippaeum Zamoscianum) 1594–1784) was an academy founded in 1594 by Polish Crown Chancellor Jan Zamoyski. It was the third institution of higher education to be founded in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. After his death it slowly lost its importance, and in 1784 it was downgraded to a lyceum. The present-day I Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Hetmana Jana Zamoyskiego w Zamościu is one of several secondary schools in Zamość.\n## History\nThe Zamoyski Academy was designed to educate szlachta (noble) youth in Humanist culture and prepare them for work in the public interest—though, from its early years, most of the students were burghers, not nobles. It was founded in 1594 by Crown Chancellor Jan Zamoyski in Zamość (a city, also founded by Zamoyski) with the assistance of poet Szymon Szymonowic, aka Simon Simonides (who would be one of the Academy's lecturers). Its founding was approved in Rome by Pope Clement VIII (bull of October 29, 1594), and in Poland by the Bishop of Chełm, Stanisław Gomoliński. The official opening ceremony took place on 15 March 1595. On July 5, 1600, Zamoyski would write, in the Academy's foundation act: \"such are countries, as is the education of their youth\" (\"takie są rzeczypospolite, jakie ich młodzieży chowanie\"). In 1601 the King of Poland, Sigismund III Vasa, confirmed the act.\nThe Academy was modeled on the Academy of Strassburg. Initially the Academy comprised three departments: liberal arts, law, and medicine, and had seven faculty positions for professors. From 1637 the school had the power to award doctor of philosophy diplomas. In 1648, a department of theology was added. The Academy was the third institution of higher education to be founded in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (and the first private one), after the Kraków Academy (1364) and Vilnius University (1578) Zamoyski's immense wealth allowed him to be the first magnate in the Commonwealth to personally sponsor such an institution (Poznań's Lubrański Academy (1519) was a high school with a high level of education, hence it was called customary \"academy\").\nThe Academy was an institution midway between a secondary school and an institution of higher learning. It bestowed doctorates of philosophy and law. It was known for the high quality of education that it provided, which however did not extend beyond the ideals of \"nobles' liberty.\"\nThe faculty included a number of outstanding Poles such as Szymon Szymonowic, Adam Burski (Bursius), Tomasz Drezner, Jan Niedźwiecki-Ursinus, Szymon (Simon) Birkowsk and Stanisław Staszic, as well as foreigners such as the English lawyer William Bruce, the Italian theologian Dominic Convalis and the Belgian mathematician Adriaan van Roomen. The Academy's chancellor was the incumbent Bishop of Chełm.\nThe students were recruited mainly from the southeastern lands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and from adjacent countries.\nFollowing an initial period of successful development, which at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries made the Academy one of the leading educational institutions in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, from the mid-17th century the Academy went into decline. The number of students rose from 70 in 1595 to 1635 to around 120 in the years 1635 to 1646.\nIts lost its lay character ten years after Zamoyski's death, when in 1615 it was taken over by the bishop of Chełm; the struggle over the control of the school between the bishops and lay officials of the Zamoyski family would continue for many years. It became increasingly difficult for the school to attract renown faculty. The academy was damaged in a fire of 1627, and from the Swedish invasion and wars of late 1640s/early 1650s. Several attempts at reform were undertaken in the following decades, none met with much success. Gradual improvement was interrupted in 1784, after the academy was shut down by the Austrian government (which had taken over that part of Poland in the late-18th-century partitions of Poland); it was closed and converted into a secondary school (Liceum Królewskie—Royal Lyceum). In 1811–66 the Lyceum's old Academy buildings were used as barracks for troops of the Zamość Fortress.\nThe present-day I Liceum Ogólnokształcące im.

{"name": "Unstan ware", "documents": ["# Unstan ware\nUnstan ware is the name used by archaeologists for a type of finely made and decorated Neolithic pottery from the 4th and 3rd millennia BC. Typical are elegant and distinctive shallow bowls with a band of grooved patterning below the rim, a type of decoration which was created using a technique known as \"stab-and-drag\". A second version consists of undecorated, round-bottomed bowls. Some of the bowls had bits of volcanic rock included in the clay to make them stronger. Bone tools were used to burnish the surfaces to make them shiny and impermeable.\nUnstan ware is named after the Unstan Chambered Cairn on the Mainland of the Orkney Islands, a fine example of a stalled chambered tomb in a circular mound, where the style of pottery was first found in 1884. Unstan ware is mostly found in tombs, specifically tombs of the Orkney-Cromarty type. These include the Tomb of the Eagles at Isbister on South Ronaldsay, and Taversoe Tuick and Midhowe on Rousay.\nUnstan ware has been found occasionally at sites in Orkney other than tombs; for example, the farmstead of Knap of Howar on Papa Westray. Although more recent excavations in Orkney have found Unstan ware to be a more common feature in a domestic context than previously thought, challenging the interpretation of Unstan ware being mainly from tombs and in the Western Isles, as at Eilean Domhnuill.\nUnstan ware may have evolved into the later grooved ware style. This interpretation was originally based primarily on a presumed evolution in pottery styles, from Unstan ware to grooved ware, seen at the settlement of Rinyo on Rousay. D.V. Clarke claimed in 1983 that his investigations at Rinyo had debunked this sequence. John Hedges is another primary proponent of what might be termed the \"cultural coexistence\" hypothesis, suggesting that although Unstan ware may predate grooved ware, the cultures associated with these styles of pottery lived side by side across Orkney for centuries. In this interpretation of the evidence, grooved ware is associated with the builders of the Maeshowe class of chambered tomb. The geographic distribution in Orkney of the two pottery types is as follows: grooved ware is found on Mainland, Sanday, and North Ronaldsay, with Unstan ware found on Mainland and the remaining islands, especially Rousay and Eday. Hedges sums up his view this way:\nWhat is important is an understanding that the neolithic population of Orkney can be divided into two major parts on the basis of some elements of their material cultures. It is probable that they originated from different areas and...there is no difficulty in imagining their ability to coexist.\nHowever, he also notes:\nOne point that should be made at the outset is that there is no discernable difference in the culture- in the social anthropological sense- of the Grooved Ware and Unstan Ware people...it is only apparent from limited aspects of material culture and the evidence...shows it to have been subordinate to a tribal level of unity which took in the whole of Orkney."], "selected_questions": ["What are the typical characteristics of Unstan ware pottery?", "According to John Hedges, how can the neolithic population of Orkney be divided based on their material cultures?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The typical characteristics of Unstan ware pottery include finely made and decorated Neolithic pottery from the 4th and 3rd millennia BC.

{"name": "Metacognitive therapy", "documents": ["# Metacognitive therapy\nMetacognitive therapy (MCT) is a psychotherapy focused on modifying metacognitive beliefs that perpetuate states of worry, rumination and attention fixation. It was created by Adrian Wells based on an information processing model by Wells and Gerald Matthews. It is supported by scientific evidence from a large number of studies.\nThe goals of MCT are first to discover what patients believe about their own thoughts and about how their mind works (called metacognitive beliefs), then to show the patient how these beliefs lead to unhelpful responses to thoughts that serve to unintentionally prolong or worsen symptoms, and finally to provide alternative ways of responding to thoughts in order to allow a reduction of symptoms. In clinical practice, MCT is most commonly used for treating anxiety disorders such as social anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), health anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as depression – though the model was designed to be transdiagnostic (meaning it focuses on common psychological factors thought to maintain all psychological disorders).\n## History\nMetacognition, Greek for \"after\" (meta) \"thought\" (cognition), refers to the human capacity to be aware of and control one's own thoughts and internal mental processes. Metacognition has been studied for several decades by researchers, originally as part of developmental psychology and neuropsychology. Examples of metacognition include a person knowing what thoughts are currently in their mind and knowing where the focus of their attention is, and a person's beliefs about their own thoughts (which may or may not be accurate). The first metacognitive interventions were devised for children with attentional disorders in the 1980s.\n## Model of mental disorders\n### Self-Regulatory Executive Function model\nIn the metacognitive model, symptoms are caused by a set of psychological processes called the cognitive attentional syndrome (CAS). The CAS includes three main processes, each of which constitutes extended thinking in response to negative thoughts. These three processes are:\nWorry/rumination Threat monitoring Coping behaviours that backfire\nAll three are driven by patients' metacognitive beliefs, such as the belief that these processes will help to solve problems, although the processes all ultimately have the unintentional consequence of prolonging distress. Of particular importance in the model are negative metacognitive beliefs, especially those concerning the uncontrollability and dangerousness of some thoughts. Executive functions are also believed to play a part in how the person can focus and refocus on certain thoughts and mental modes. These mental modes can be categorized as object mode and metacognitive mode, which refers to the different types of relationships people can have towards thoughts. All of the CAS, the metacognitive beliefs, the mental modes and the executive function together constitute the self-regulatory executive function model (S-REF). This is also known as the metacognitive model. In more recent work, Wells has described in greater detail a metacognitive control system of the S-REF aimed at advancing research and treatment using metacognitive therapy.\n## Therapeutic intervention\nMCT is a time-limited therapy which usually takes place between 8–12 sessions. The therapist uses discussions with the patient to discover their metacognitive beliefs, experiences and strategies. The therapist then shares the model with the patient, pointing out how their particular symptoms are caused and maintained.\nTherapy then proceeds with the introduction of techniques tailored to the patient's difficulties aimed at changing how the patient relates to thoughts and that bring extended thinking under control. Experiments are used to challenge metacognitive beliefs (e.g. \"You believe that if you worry too much you will go 'mad' – let's try worrying as much as possible for the next five minutes and see if there is any effect\") and strategies such as attentional training technique and detached mindfulness (this is a distinct strategy from various other mindfulness techniques).\n## Research\nClinical trials (including randomized controlled trials) have found MCT to produce large clinically significant improvements across a range of mental health disorders, although as of 2014 the total number of subjects studied is small and a meta-analysis concluded that further study is needed before strong conclusions can be drawn regarding effectiveness. A 2015 special issue of the journal Cognitive Therapy and Research was devoted to MCT research findings.\nA 2018 meta-analysis confirmed the effectiveness of MCT in the treatment of a variety of psychological complaints with depression and anxiety showing high effect sizes. It concluded, \"Our findings indicate that MCT is an effective treatment for a range of psychological complaints. To date, strongest evidence exists for anxiety and depression. Current results suggest that MCT may be superior to other psychotherapies, including cognitive behavioral interventions. However, more trials with larger number of participants are needed in order to draw firm conclusions.\"\nIn 2020, a study showed superior effectiveness in MCT over CBT in the treatment of depression. It summarised, \"MCT appears promising and might offer a necessary advance in depression treatment, but there is insufficient evidence at present from adequately powered trials to assess the relative efficacy of MCT compared with CBT in depression.\"\nIn 2018–2020, a research topic in the journal Frontiers in Psychology highlighted the growing experimental, clinical, and neuropsychological evidence base for MCT.\nA recent network meta-analysis indicated that MCT (and cognitive processing therapy) might be superior to other psychological treatments for PTSD. However, although the evidence-base for MCT is promising and growing, it is important to note that most clinical trials investigating MCT is characterized by small and select samples and potential conflict of interests as its originator is involved in most clinical trials conducted. As such, there is a pressing need for larger, preferably pragmatic, well-conducted randomized controlled trials, conducted by independent trialists without potential conflict of interests before there is a large scale implementation of MCT in community mental health clinics."], "selected_questions": ["What are the goals of Metacognitive Therapy?", "What are some techniques used in Metacognitive Therapy?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["", "Some techniques used in Metacognitive Therapy include:\n\n1.

{"name": "Hard infrastructure", "documents": ["# Hard infrastructure\nHard infrastructure, also known as tangible or built infrastructure, is the physical infrastructure of roads, bridges, tunnels, railways, ports, and harbors, among others, as opposed to the soft infrastructure or \"intangible infrastructure of human capital in the form of education, research, health and social services and \"institutional infrastructure\" in the form of legal, economic and social systems.  This article delineates both the capital goods, or fixed assets, and the control systems, software required to operate, manage and monitor the systems, as well as any accessory buildings, plants, or vehicles that are an essential part of the system. Also included are fleets of vehicles operating according to schedules such as public transit buses and garbage collection, as well as basic energy or communications facilities that are not usually part of a physical network, such as oil refineries, radio, and television broadcasting facilities.\n## Attributes\nHard infrastructure in general usually has the following attributes:\n### Capital assets that provide services\nThese are physical assets that provide services. The people employed in the hard infrastructure sector generally maintain, monitor, and operate the assets, but do not offer services to the clients or users of the infrastructure. Interactions between workers and clients are generally limited to administrative tasks concerning ordering, scheduling, or billing of services.\n### Large networks\nThese are large networks constructed over generations and are not often replaced as a whole system. The network provides services to a geographically defined area, and has a long life because its service capacity is maintained by continual refurbishment or replacement of components as they wear out.\n### Historicity and interdependence\nThe system or network tends to evolve over time as it is continuously modified, improved, enlarged, and as various components are rebuilt, decommissioned or adapted to other uses. The system components are interdependent and not usually capable of subdivision or separate disposal, and consequently are not readily disposable within the commercial marketplace. The system interdependency may limit a component life to a lesser period than the expected life of the component itself.\n### Natural monopoly\nThe systems tend to be natural monopolies, insofar that economies of scale means that multiple agencies providing a service are less efficient than would be the case if a single agency provided the service. This is because the assets have a high initial cost and a value that is difficult to determine. Once most of the system is built, the marginal cost of servicing additional clients or users tends to be relatively inexpensive, and may be negligible if there is no need to increase the peak capacity or the geographical extent of the network.\nIn public economics theory, infrastructure assets such as highways and railways tend to be public goods, in that they carry a high degree of non-excludability, where no household can be excluded from using it, and non-rivalry, where no household can reduce another from enjoying it. These properties lead to externality, free ridership, and spillover effects that distort perfect competition and market efficiency. Hence, government becomes the best actor to supply the public goods.\n## Transportation\nIn 1990, Grübler discussed the history and importance of transportation infrastructures like canals, railroads, highways, airways and pipelines.\nRoad and highway networks, including structures (bridges, tunnels, culverts, retaining walls), signage and markings, electrical systems (street lighting and traffic lights), edge treatments (curbs, sidewalks, landscaping), and specialised facilities such as road maintenance depots and rest areas Mass transit systems (Commuter rail systems, subways, Light rail, ferries, trolleys, City Bicycle Sharing system, City Car Sharing system and bus transportation) Railways, including structures, terminal facilities (rail yards, railway stations), level crossings, signalling and communications systems Canals and navigable waterways requiring continuous maintenance (dredging, etc.) Seaports and lighthouses Airports, including air navigational systems Bicycle paths and pedestrian walkways, including pedestrian bridges, pedestrian underpasses and other specialised structures for cyclists and pedestrians\n## Energy\nThe OECD classifies coal mines, oil wells and natural gas wells as part of the mining sector, and power generation as part of the industrial sector of the economy, not part of infrastructure.\nElectrical power network, including generation plants, electrical grid, substations, and local distribution. Natural gas pipelines, storage and distribution terminals, as well as the local distribution network. Some definitions may include the gas wells, as well as the fleets of ships and trucks transporting liquefied gas. Petroleum pipelines, including associated storage and distribution terminals. Some definitions may include the oil wells, refineries, as well as the fleets of tanker ships and trucks. Specialised coal handling facilities for washing, storing, and transporting coal. Some definitions may include Coal mines. Steam or hot water production and distribution networks for district heating systems. Electric vehicle networks for charging electric vehicles.\n## Water management\nDrinking water supply, including the system of pipes, storage reservoirs, pumps, valves, filtration and treatment equipment and meters, including buildings and structures to house the equipment, used for the collection, treatment and distribution of drinking water Sewage collection, and disposal of waste water Drainage systems (storm sewers, ditches, etc.) Major irrigation systems (reservoirs, irrigation canals) Major flood control systems (dikes, levees, major pumping stations and floodgates) Large-scale snow removal, including fleets of salt spreaders, snow plows, snowblowers, dedicated dump trucks, sidewalk plows, the dispatching and routing systems for these fleets, as well as fixed assets such as snow dumps, snow chutes, snow melters Coastal management, including structures such as seawalls, breakwaters, groynes, floodgates, as well as the use of soft engineering techniques such as beach nourishment, sand dune stabilisation and the protection of mangrove forests and coastal wetlands.\n## Communications\nOECD lists communications under its economic infrastructure Common Reporting Standard codes.\nPostal service, including sorting facilities Telephone networks (land lines) including telephone exchange systems Mobile phone networks Television and radio transmission stations, including the regulations and standards governing broadcasting Cable television physical networks including receiving stations and cable distribution networks (does not include content providers or \"cable networks\" when used in the sense of a specialised channel such as CNN or MTV) The Internet, including the internet backbone, core routers and server farms, local internet service providers as well as the protocols and other basic software required for the system to function (does not include specific websites, although may include some widely used web-based services, such as social network services and web search engines) Communications satellites Undersea cables Major private, government or dedicated telecommunications networks, such as those used for internal communication and monitoring by major infrastructure companies, by governments, by the military or by emergency services, as well as national research and education networks Pneumatic tube mail distribution networks\n## Solid waste management\nMunicipal garbage and recyclables collection Solid waste landfills Solid waste incinerators and plasma gasification facilities Materials recovery facilities Hazardous waste disposal facilities\n## Earth monitoring and measurement networks\nMeteorological monitoring networks Tidal monitoring networks Stream Gauge or fluviometric monitoring networks Seismometer networks Earth observation satellites Geodetic benchmarks Global Positioning System Spatial Data Infrastructure"], "selected_questions": ["What are the components of hard infrastructure in water management?"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["The components of hard infrastructure in water management include:\n1.

{"name": "巴别塔", "documents": ["# 巴别塔\n\n宗教传说中的高塔\n\n巴别塔，也叫巴比伦塔，是《圣经·旧约·创世记》第11章故事中人们建造的塔。根据《圣经·旧约·创世记》篇章记载，当时人类联合起来兴建希望能通往天堂的高塔；为了阻止人类的计划，上帝让人类说不同的语言，使人类相互之间不能沟通，计划因此失败，人类自此各散东西。此事件，为世上出现不同语言和种族提供解释。", "## 巴别塔\n巴比伦塔 （，Migdal Bāḇēl）；也译作巴贝尔塔、巴别塔，或意译为通天塔），本是犹太教《塔纳赫·创世纪篇》（该书又被称作《希伯来圣经》或者《旧约全书》）中的一个故事，说的是人类产生不同语言的起源。在这个故事中，一群只说一种语言的人在“大洪水”之后从东方来到了示拿（שנער）地区，并决定在这修建一座城市和一座“能够通天的”高塔；上帝见此情形就把他们的语言打乱，让他们再也不能明白对方的意思，并把他们分散到了世界各地。\n根据一些现代学者的看法，巴别塔和一些已知的建筑物之间存在联系，其中一个十分著名的就是“Etemenanki神庙”，一座由新巴比伦帝国国王那波帕拉萨尔修建献给美索不达米亚的神马尔杜克的塔庙（大约是在公元前610年建造）。这座“巴比伦大金字塔”高-1。亚历山大大帝在公元前331年左右下令拆毁这座神庙好在原址上建造他的陵墓。在苏美尔故事《Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta》中也出现了相似的情节。\n## 相关故事\n创世记第11章1-9句记录了“巴别城”的故事。当时地上的人们都说同一种语言，当人们离开东方之后，他们来到了示拿之地。在那里，人们想方设法烧砖好让他们能够造出一座城和一座高耸入云的塔来传播自己的名声，以免他们分散到世界各地。上帝来到人间后看到了这座城和这座塔，说一群只说一种语言的人以后便没有他们做不成的事了；于是上帝将他们的语言打乱，这样他们就不能听懂对方说什么了，还把他们分散到了世界各地，这座城市也停止了修建。这座城市就被称为“巴别城”。圣经是这样描写的：\n##词源\n“巴别塔”这个词从没在《圣经》中出现过；经常只是以“那座城和那座塔”（אֶת-הָעִיר וְאֶת-הַמִּגְדָּל）的字样或者就是“那座城”（הָעִיר）。“巴别”的意思是“上帝之门”，源于阿卡德语中的bab-ilu（𒁀𒀊 𒅋𒌋），bab的意思是“门”，ilu的意思是“上帝”。 根据《圣经》中的解释，该城的名字“巴别”来源于希伯来语balal，意思是“混乱”。\n## 解读\n### 主旨\n这个故事解释了“confusion of tongues”，也就是人类语言多样的原因。故事的主旨“神与人的斗争”贯穿于“创世纪”以及“伊甸园中的亚当和夏娃”的情节中。 在公元1世纪弗拉维奥·约瑟夫斯所著的对圣经的犹太解释中，是暴君宁录建造巴别塔的，他想以此傲慢的举动来表示对上帝的不屑。但是，这部权威著作在当代也遭到了一些挑战，人们研究的更多的是约瑟夫在文章1、4、6卷大力宣扬的“文化和语言的同次性”。 在这部分文字中，上帝的行为不仅是对人类傲慢的惩罚，也是文化多样性的缘由，巴别塔被看做是“文明的摇篮”。\n### 体裁\n巴别塔的故事（《创世纪》11.1–9）是属于释源体裁的故事，是对一类现象的解释。释源体裁的作品是用来解释风俗习惯、仪式、地理特征、名称和其他现象来由的叙事作品。 巴别塔的故事解释了语言多样化的原因：上帝担心人类会因为过度自由而而肆意妄为，所以他让语言变得多种多样。 也正因为如此，人类被分成了不同的语言群体，再也不能明白对方的话。\n###作者和来源考证\n一直以来，人们认为《摩西五经》的作者是摩西；但是到了19世纪，尤利乌斯·威尔豪森提出了底本学说， 认为《摩西五经》有四个出处：耶和华文献（J）、伊罗兴文献（E）、和祭祀文献（P）和申命记作者（D）。在这种假说中，巴别塔的故事出自耶和华文献。巴别塔故事的“释源体”叙事风格（参见上文“体裁”）被认为是典型的耶和华文献风格。\n## 历史语境\n圣经学者不一定把创世纪解释为严格的历史事件的记录。 尽管如此，巴别塔的神话可以用其语境来解释。\n创世纪10:10中描述巴别塔（LXX：Βαβυλών）是宁录王国的一部分。圣经中并没有提及是宁录下令修建巴别塔的，但是有许多文献资料都认为巴别塔的修建和宁录有关。\n创世纪11:9中提到希伯来语中的“Babel”这两个字来源于动词“balal”，在希伯来语中意为“使困惑”或“使混乱”。1世纪的罗马犹太作家弗拉维奥·约瑟夫斯也有过相似的论述，他认为这座塔的名字来源于希伯来语Babel（βαβὲλ），意思是“混淆”。 该词在“七十士译本”中对应的希腊文是“巴比伦”（Βαβυλὼν），词源是阿卡德语中的“Bāb-ilim”，意为“神之门”，指的是古苏美尔地区（圣经中的示拿地）的巴比伦神庙金字塔。如今古巴比伦的遗迹保留在伊拉克巴比伦省的希拉城附近。\n创世纪11:8–9还记载了在巴别城被废弃之后，耶和华就将在《创世纪》第十章所列出的居住在示拿地区的挪亚的子孙（“挪亚众子”）分散到了世界各地。一些人认为这与之前《创世纪》10:5所描述的“这些人的后裔将各国的地土、海岛分开居住，各随各的方言、宗族立国”与后来巴别塔故事的开场“那时，天下人的口音言语都是一样。”（《创世纪》11:1）相矛盾。 但是，这种观点的成立条件是10:5与11:1中的发生的事件遵守严格的时间先后顺序；但传统的犹太基督教解释是10:5中的记载和后来在11:9中更加详细的记载指的都是同一件事。后来解决《创世纪》10:5和11:8-9中自相矛盾内容的是底本学说，该学说认为这些内容的不同来源才是造成内容矛盾的原因。圣经学者们猜想《创世纪》中的故事有四个出处（J, E, P, D），10:5出自“祭祀文献”（ P），而11:8-9（实际上整个巴别塔故事）则出自“耶和华文献”（J）。\n## 巴比伦埃特曼安吉神庙\n### 坍塌\n《创世纪》中并没有提及任何有关巴别塔毁灭的事情，只说那些被打乱了语言的人被分散到了世界各地并且停止了建造他们的城市。但是在其他资料，比如《Book of Jubilees》（第10章18-27），克利厄斯·亚历山大的手稿（第10卷），Abydenus的手稿（第5卷和第6卷），约瑟夫斯的《犹太古书》1.4.3以及《西比拉神谕》（第3卷117-129）中则记载的是上帝用大风推倒了这座塔。在米德拉什中说，塔顶被烧毁，塔底被埋入了大地，塔身则立在原地随着时间流逝而不断遭到侵蚀。\n### 巴比伦埃特曼安吉神庙\n埃特曼安吉（苏美尔语，意为“天地之基神庙”）是一座在巴比伦修建来供奉马杜克的神庙的名字。后期著名的重建工作是由公元前6世纪的新巴比伦帝国统治者那波帕拉萨尔和尼布甲尼撒二世实施。根据一些当代学者的看法，如Stephen L. Harris，圣经中巴别塔的故事很有可能是在“巴比伦之囚”时期受到了埃特曼安吉神庙的影响。\n那波帕拉萨尔还写道最初的那座塔在古代就已经建造了，“之前有一位国王建造了一座‘大地七灯庙’，但是顶端的工程还没有完成。很久以后，人们逐渐废弃了这座神庙，从此地震和雷电就不断的摧毁着那早已被太阳晒的干裂的墙体；砖块都开始瓦解，内部的结构也早已变成一堆废墟。\n艾萨克·阿西莫夫在他的《Asimov's Guide to the Bible》一书中猜想写《创世纪》11:1-9内容的人是受到了当时巴比伦帝国一座未能建造完成的神庙的启发，而且错误的认为两个单词之前存在联系，并因此“《创世纪》的作者认为“Babel\"来源于希伯来语中的“babal”，其意思为‘杂乱的’，‘迷惑的’，‘混淆的’”。\n2011年，学者们在Schøyen Collection中发现了迄今为止最早的埃特曼安吉神庙的画作。 “巴别石柱塔”（如今的名字）可以追溯到公元前604-562年的尼布甲尼撒二世时期。\n希腊历史学家希罗多德（公元前440年）曾写到过巴比伦神庙，他称其为“宙斯的神殿”，其中描述了神庙的庞大。\n本就已经破败不堪的巴比伦神庙最终在亚历山大大帝的一次重建中毁于一旦。他成功将塔的瓦片移到了另一个地方，但是他死后重建工作也随之停止。\n### 《禧年书》\n《Book of Jubilees》中有至今为止有关巴别塔最详细的叙述。\n他们开始建造城和塔。他们用火烧砖，把砖当石头来用。他们又拿石漆当灰泥，石漆来自海水和希纳尔的泉水。他们用了四十三年的时间来建城和造塔。塔的宽度有203块砖。每块砖的长度是高度的三倍。塔的高度是5433腕尺又2掌。〔塔的墙〕长十三斯塔德。（《禧年书》10:20-21,1913年查理译本）\n###《斐洛圣经古代史》\n《斐洛圣经古代史》是最早记述有关内容的作品之一（大约在公元70年），但是人们普遍认为这本书并非斐洛所写。该书记载指挥建造巴别塔的人不只是含米特王子宁录，还有闪米特王子约坍以及雅弗人的王子、多单的儿子芬内克。有十二个人因为拒绝用砖造塔而被逮捕，其中包括亚伯拉罕、罗得、拿鹤和约坍的几个儿子，但是约坍最终还是将这十二个人从另外两个王子的盛怒之下救了出来。\n### 约瑟夫斯的《犹太古书》\n犹太-罗马历史学家弗拉维奥·约瑟夫斯在他的《Antiquities of the Jews》（大约在公元94年成书）所描述的历史事件和在希伯来圣经中所发现的内容相近，而且其中还提到了巴别塔。他在书中写到是宁录修建了这座塔，而宁录则是一个想让人们远离上帝的一个暴君。在这本书中，上帝让人们变得无法交流而不是毁灭人类的原因是即使是大洪水那样的灾难也没能让人们变得虔诚。根据该书记载，是宁录教唆人们反抗和藐视上帝的。宁录是汉姆的孙子，诺亚的儿子，没有头发，臂力惊人。他劝人们不要将幸福归功于上帝，就像是因为他人们才过得如此幸福那样，他还让人们相信是他们自身的勇气造就了他们如今的幸福生活。他在意识到无法将人们因恐惧而对上帝产生的信仰转变成对他能力的信任后就开始实行暴政；后来众人都听从宁录的指示，将对上帝的屈服看做是一种软弱的行为；他们开始不辞劳苦地建造一座塔，丝毫也不敢怠慢这件事，由于参与修建的人很多，塔建的很高，速度也比被人们预想的要快。虽然塔建得很高，也很结实，但是从远处看的时候，人们总感觉它并没有实际上那么宏伟。他们用沥青来烧砖，再用泥浆将砖块粘合，所以塔的防水性能很好。当上帝看到他们的疯狂举动时，他决定不再毁灭他们，因为他认为他之前毁灭的那些罪人（“大洪水中的人”）并没有让他们从中吸取教训；但是他却让他们之间产生了不同的语言，这让他们陷入了一片喧闹之中；因为语言不同，他们再也不能听懂对方的意思。他们当初建造那座塔的地方现在被叫做“巴比伦”，因为那个能让他们自由交谈的语言就是在这开始被打乱的；“巴别”在希伯来语中的意思就是“混乱”。\n### 希腊的《巴鲁克启示录》\n《Third Apocalypse of Baruch》（约出现于2世纪）是伪典中的一部，描述了有罪的人和正直的人在来生都得到了应得的惩罚和奖励，那些罪人中就有当初煽动建造巴别塔的人。 这部作品中巴鲁克有时以第一视角（在异象中）描述了那些“建造了一个向上帝表示不满的塔，然后主便将他们放逐”人们的安息之地，有时则会以狗的形态出现在另一个地方。\n因为那些为修建巴别塔建言献策的人，无数的男人和女人都被迫去烧制砖块。其中有一个女人，即使是在她快分娩的时候也不被允许离开，于是孩子在她烧砖的时候出世了，她只能把孩子放在围裙里，背在身上，然后继续去烧砖。后来上帝出现了，打乱了他们的语言，当时他们正把塔建到463腕尺高。人们还曾拿着一个尖锐的手钻想把天堂刺破，他们高喊道“让我们看看天堂是用泥土、黄铜还是钢铁做成的吧”。上帝看到他们的行为后自然不允许他们这么做，他让人们变得目盲，并且打乱了他们的语言，于是他们就成了现在的样子。（《巴鲁克第三启示录》3:5-8）\n### 米德拉什\n拉比文献记录了许多关于建造巴别塔的各种缘由以及建造者的不同意图。根据其中米德拉什的一篇文章，修建塔的人们，犹太人的作品中称其为“分离的一代”，说：“上帝无权让自己居住在天堂，却把我们留在凡间；因此我们要建一座塔，塔上放上一个拿着剑的塑像，让他看起来就像在跟上帝宣战一样”。\n建造巴别塔不仅是对上帝表示不敬，也是对亚伯拉罕表达不敬，亚伯拉罕曾告诫建造者们要虔诚信仰上帝。文章中还提到修建塔的人对上帝出言不逊，说天堂每隔1656年就会摇晃一次好让天水能够倾倒在大地上，所以他们才要用柱子把天堂撑住防止灾难再次发生。\n当时有些人甚至想在天堂中发动对上帝的战争（见《塔木德》）。当他们见到射上天空的箭掉到地面后还在滴血时，他们备受鼓舞，因为人们认为他们可以向居住在天堂中的神们宣战了（见雅煞珥书9:12-36）。根据约瑟夫斯和“拉比以列谢圣章”14章的说法，宁录是教唆他的同伙修建巴别塔的主犯，但是其他的希伯来文献则称宁录和修建塔的人没什么关系。\n根据米德拉什的记载，有三分之一的巴别塔建造者受到上帝的惩罚，变成了半人半魔的怪物，而且被放逐到了三个平行世界中，如今他们的子孙还居住在那儿。\n### 伊斯兰教传统\n《古兰经》中也有一篇和《圣经》中的巴别塔故事相似的描写，只不过当中没有提及塔的名称，故事背景也是在摩西时代的埃及：法老让哈曼为他建造一座石塔（也有说是土塔），好让他能上天堂见到摩西。\n而在《古兰经》2:102则提到了“巴比尔”这个名字，但是故事是这样的：天使哈努特和玛努特向部分巴比伦人传授魔法，后来却又警告他们说魔法是一种罪恶，他们传授魔法只是对他们忠诚的考验。\n在雅谷特的书和《Lisān al-ʿArab》（Lisān al-ʿArab）中则提及了一个更详细的“巴比尔”的故事，但是并没有提到塔：人类被一阵大风挂到了一处他们后来称之为“巴比尔”的地方，上帝在那里将不同的语言分配给他们，然后用同样的方式将人类分散到各处。9世纪的一位穆斯林神学家塔巴里在他的书籍《先知与王的历史》中对此给出了更详细的叙述：宁录在巴比尔建造了这座塔，上帝毁了这座塔，然后当时人类的语言，古叙利亚语，分化为72种语言。13世纪的另一名穆斯林历史学家，阿布·菲达也说过同样的故事，还补充说上帝允许族长希伯（亚伯拉罕的祖先）保留最初的语言，希伯来语，因为他没有参与塔的建造。\n根据作家Yahiya Emerick的观点，虽然伊斯兰传说中存在着许多和犹太基督教的“巴别塔”故事相似的成分，但是，圣经中“上帝将人类按照语言不同而分开”的中心思想却是和伊斯兰教不同的。他说，在伊斯兰教看来，上帝创造国家是为了让他们互相了解而不是将他们分开。\n###《摩尔门经》\n在《摩尔门经》中，一位叫做雅列和他的家人在“巴别塔”时期向主呼求不要打乱他们的语言。由于他们的祈祷，主保留了他们的语言并且指引他们去了名为“Valley of Nimrod”的山谷，他们便从那儿坐船来到了美洲。\n耶稣基督后期圣徒教会一直都被告诉有关巴别塔的故事不是传说或寓言故事，而是真实的历史事件。“虽然如今许多人都认为有关‘大洪水’和‘巴别塔’的故事都是虚构的，耶稣基督后期圣徒教会的人却坚信它们曾确实发生过”。\n###爱尔兰传说\n在一些爱尔兰文献，如《夺取爱尔兰记》和《Auraicept na n-Éces》（Auraicept na n-Éces）中都称他们的传奇国王Fenius Farsa选取了被打乱语言中的精华后将它们融合在一起，创造了戈伊德尔语，也就是爱尔兰语的前身。\n### 西方文化\n历史语言学家们一直在研究有关“单一语言”的理论。从中世纪一直到17世纪，人们一直在尝试找到仍在使用的“Adamic language”的派生语言。\n老彼得·勃鲁盖尔那幅被人们所津津乐道的《巴别塔》以罗马斗兽场为原型，而后来有关巴别塔的绘画（如古斯塔夫·多雷的作品）在造型上更像19世纪探险家们在当地发现的穆斯林塔，其中著名的有萨迈拉大清真寺。M·C·埃舍尔在其表现这个故事的木刻中更具风格的几何构造。\n作曲家安东·鲁宾斯坦曾根据该故事创作出了歌剧《巴别塔》（Der Thurm zu Babel）。\n美国舞蹈家Adam Darius曾于1993年在伦敦的当代艺术学院上演过一出用多种语言表演的\"巴别塔\"舞台剧。\n弗里茨·朗1927年的电影“大都会”中的一个闪回镜头则展现了居住在城市高塔中的上层人士与居住在地下的工人之间因缺少沟通而导致的不和。而这最终也引发工人因无法忍受恶劣的工作环境而起义并摧毁了这座塔。\nA·S·拜厄特在他的小说《巴别塔》（1996）中探讨了这样一个问题：“语言能否被分割？如果不能的话，为什么人们在交谈的时候却不能理解对方的话呢？”\n##类似神话\n### 苏美尔神话\n苏美尔神话中有一个和巴别塔传说相似的故事，叫做“恩麦卡尔与阿拉塔之王”， 讲的是乌鲁克的恩麦卡尔要在埃里都建造一座庞大的神庙并且要求Aratta人贡献宝物来帮助修建，他曾经念动咒语恳求神恩基恢复（克雷默的翻译为“瓦解”）有人类居住地区的语言统一性，也就是当时的斯巴图地区、哈马兹地区、苏美尔地区、阿卡德地区和马尔图地区，“愿全天下所有受到恩泽眷顾的人们都用一种语言来称呼恩利尔”（注：“恩利尔”为苏美尔神话中的主神）\n###其他与塔有关的传说\n在美洲中部还流传着许多和巴别塔相近的传说。一些作家还将乔鲁拉大金字塔和巴别塔联系起来，但也有人认为二者没什么关系。道明会修道士蒂亚戈·杜兰（1537-1588）称他曾在墨西哥被征服后不久在乔鲁拉从一个一百岁的神父口中听到过关于金字塔的叙述，说当阳光首次照到地面的时候，巨人们便开始去寻找太阳；毫无成果之后，他们就建造了一座直通天际的塔。一位天堂中的王对此勃然大怒，他命令天堂中的人民摧毁了这座塔，而且将巨人们分散开来。这个故事和“大洪水”以及“语言的混乱”都没有什么联系，但是弗雷泽认为巨人们建造的这座塔以及他们后来的天各一方都和巴别塔存在联系。\n在一个当地历史学家Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl（1565？-1648）认为出自古托尔特克人的故事中，人类在大洪水之后数量急速增加，而且还建造了一座“zacuali”(意为高塔)，来保护他们免遭下一场次大洪水的灾难。但是，他们的语言却被打乱，他们也被分散到世界各地。\n而在Tohono O'odham people的另一个故事中，蒙特苏马在大洪水中躲过一劫后变成了一个邪恶的人，他想要建造一座直通天堂的房子，但是上帝用闪电击毁了这座房子。（班考夫特，第三卷，76页；在“亚利桑那州历史”中也曾出现过这个故事）\n而根据戴维·利文斯通的记载，他在非洲遇到的居住在恩加米湖附近的人们就有这样一个传说，只不过还加上了“修建者的头被掉下来的脚手架砸破了”（ Missionary Travels，26章）\n在苏格兰社会人类学家詹姆士·乔治·弗雷泽爵士于1918年出版的《旧约中的民俗》一书中，记录了旧约中诸如“大洪水”这样的故事以及世界各地传说之间的相似性。他用在《洛奇神话集》中找到的一个传说证实了利文斯通的描述。在这个故事中，一群恶人用桅杆堆了一座塔想去追随“尼杨贝”——一个顺着蜘蛛网逃到天堂的造物主，这群人后来被坍塌的桅杆砸死了。弗雷泽还记录了一个在非洲阿善堤地区类似的传说，只不过把桅杆换成了粥杵。根据他的叙述，刚果和坦桑尼亚也有过类似的传说——人们把木棍和树木堆起来好登上月球，结果失败了。 他还说印度阿萨姆邦的Karbi people和库基人中也有类似的故事。弗雷泽还认为缅甸克伦邦人也受到亚伯拉罕教的影响——该民族认为他们的祖先本是亚当的第30代后裔克耶族；在语言产生分歧后，克伦族就从原克耶族分出而移居到了现在的地方。他还注意到在阿德默勒尔蒂群岛也流传一个版本，叙述那里的人们语言混乱导致无法建成通天房屋。\n在尼泊尔和印度北部的塔鲁人也有一个相似度极高的故事。（《Report of the Census of Bengal》，1872年，160页）\n###语言的分化\n世界各地还流传着许多有关神将最初的一种语言分化成好几种语言的传说，不过这些传说中都没有提到与塔有关的事物。除了希腊神话中赫耳墨斯混淆语言迫使宙斯让位给Phoroneus的故事外，弗雷泽还特别提到了在肯尼亚的瓦萨尼地区、阿萨姆邦的卡沙那加人、澳大利亚遭遇湾地区、加利福利亚Maidu、阿拉斯加特林吉特人、以及危地马拉的基切人中都流传有有类似的故事。\n爱沙尼亚神话“语言的调和”中也有类似的情节。\n### 中国《尚书》的“绝地天通”\n《国语·楚语下》：昭王问于观射父，曰：「《周书》所谓重、黎寔使天地不通者，何也？若无然，民将能登天乎？」对曰：「非此之谓也。古者民神不杂。民之精爽不携贰者，而又能齐肃衷正，其智能上下比义，其圣能光远宣朗，其明能光照之，其聪能月彻之，如是则明神降之，在男曰觋，在女曰巫。是使制神之处位次主，而为之牲器时服，而后使先圣之后之有光烈，而能知山川之号、高祖之主、宗庙之事、昭穆之世、齐敬之勤、礼节之宜、威仪之则、容貌之崇、忠信之质、禋洁之服，而敬恭明神者，以为之祝。使名姓之后，能知四时之生、牺牲之物、玉帛之类、采服之仪、彝器之量、次主之度、屏摄之位、坛场之所、上下之神、氏姓之出，而心率旧典者为之宗。于是乎有天地神民类物之官，是谓五官，各司其序，不相乱也。民是以能有忠信，神是以能有明德，民神异业，敬而不渎，故神降之嘉生，民以物享，祸灾不至，求用不匮。\n及少皞之衰也，九黎乱德，民神杂糅，不可方物。夫人作享，家为巫史，无有要质。民匮于祀，而不知其福。烝享无度，民神同位。民渎齐盟，无有严威。神狎民则，不蠲其为。嘉生不降，无物以享。祸灾荐臻，莫尽其气。颛顼受之，乃命南正重司天以属神，命火正黎司地以属民，使复旧常，无相侵渎，是谓绝地天通。……」\n《书·吕刑》：“乃命重黎，绝地天通，罔有降格。”《尚书孔氏传》： “重即羲，黎即和。尧命羲和世掌天地四时之官，使人神不扰，各得其序，是谓绝地天通。言天神无有降地，地祇不至于天，明不相干。”\n中国古神话传说：黄帝时代，民神杂糅，神可以自由的上天下地，而人也可以通过天梯——即“昆仑山，黄帝所造”往来于天地之间。颛顼对天地间的秩序进行一次大整顿。他命“重”（颛顼帝的孙子）两手托天，奋力上举；令“黎”（颛顼帝的孙子）两手按地，尽力下压。于是，天地之间的距离越来越大，以至于除了昆仑天梯，天地间的通道都被隔断。颛顼还命令“重”和“黎”分别掌管天上众神事务及地上神和人的事务。此后，天地间神人不经“重”“黎”许可便不能够随便上天下地。\n##塔的高度\n《创世纪》中并没有提及这座塔的高度，描写这座塔时用的是“塔顶通天”（见《创世纪·第十一章》第四句），后来这四个字成为形容某样事物高的吓人的俚语；这句话并不带有任何傲慢的意思，只是一种被人们用惯形容“高”的一种表达而已。但是许多非正统的文学作品中都提及了这座塔的高度。\n《禧年书》中提到巴别塔高5433腕尺2掌宽，相当于现在的0，是哈里发塔高度的三倍，大约是1.6英里。《巴鲁克第三启示录》中则提到塔高463腕尺，大概是211.8米（695英尺），在高0的艾菲尔铁塔于1889年建成之前，它一直是人类历史上最高的建筑物。\n都尔的额我略在其大约是公元594年的作品中引用了之前一位历史学家奥罗修斯的话（约是公元417年），“塔是在一处十分平坦的地面上沿四周展开修建的。墙体是用沥青烧制成的砖块接合而成，宽50腕尺，高200腕尺，周长为470斯塔德。每一侧都有25扇门，总共是100扇门。每扇门的门板都十分巨大，而且都由青铜铸成。奥罗修斯还讲述了许多和这座城市有关的故事，还说“虽然它是如此的辉煌，但最终还是被毁灭了，不复存在。”\n中世纪的Giovanni Villani认为“塔的周长是80英里，高4,000佩斯，即2，厚度是1000佩斯，而一佩斯是3英尺。” 14世纪的游者约翰·曼德维尔也记载过有关巴别塔的事，而且他根据当地居民的说法称塔的高度是64弗隆，也就是0。\n17世纪的历史学家Verstegan则认同伊西多尔的观点，说巴别塔高5,164佩斯，相当于1，宽1,000佩斯，还引用了约瑟夫的话：塔的宽度比其高度更长，与其称其为一座塔不如称其为一座山。他还引用了一些匿名作家的话，他们说塔的螺旋式台阶很宽，宽到能为工人和动物提供居所，还有的作家称台阶上还有田地用来为参与建造的动物种植谷物。\nJ.E. Gordon博士在他的书《结构科学：事物为什么不会倒下》中也曾探讨过巴别塔的高度问题，他写到“石块的重量大概是每立方英尺120磅（每立方公尺2000千克），而它们的抗压强度通常都大于6,000磅力每平方英寸，也就是4千万帕斯卡。计算表明，如果塔的墙壁互相垂直建造的话，在达到1高度的时候，塔底的石块就会被压碎。但是如果他们建造的塔是锥形的话，那么希纳尔人们早就在石块撑不住自身重量之前就因为氧气稀薄而呼吸困难了。”\n##分化的语言数量\n有几部中世纪的编年史作品曾试图列举出在巴别塔时代产生的语言数量。由于《创世纪》第十章（LXX）中列出了诺亚后代的名字，其中15个是雅弗的子孙，30个是哈姆的子孙，27个是闪的子孙，因此巴别塔时期后一共产生了72种语言的说法便逐渐被人们接受，不过随着时间推移，人们对确切的语言数量依然持有不同看法。（“七十士译本”中比“马苏拉文本”中的同一章里多出了两个人物：爱丽萨和凯南，所以早期的希伯来故事传说，比如《密西拿》中都记载的是有70种语言）。一些持72种观点的早期资料是2世纪的基督教学者克莱曼特（Stromata I, 21）和希坡律陀（On the Psalms 9）的作品；在古叙利亚语文献Cave of Treasures（约为公元350年），埃陂法尼的《Cave of

巴别塔\n\n宗教传说中的高塔\n\n同义词\n巴比伦塔（通天塔）一般指巴别塔（宗教传说中的高塔）\n\n巴别塔，也叫巴比伦塔，是《圣经·旧约·创世记》第11章故事中人们建造的塔。根据《圣经·旧约·创世记》篇章记载，当时人类联合起来兴建希望能通往天堂的高塔；为了阻止人类的计划，上帝让人类说不同的语言，使人类相互之间不能沟通，计划因此失败，人类自此各散东西。此事件，为世上出现不同语言和种族提供解释。", "巴别塔，又称巴比伦塔。传说中是新巴比伦王国的国王尼布甲尼撒二世主持修建或增建的一座高塔。\n在希伯来语中，“巴别”是“变乱”的意思，于是这座塔就称作“巴别塔”。也有人将“变乱”一词解释为“巴比伦”，称那座城叫“巴比伦城”，称那座塔叫“巴比伦塔”。\n\n## 简介\n\n而在巴比伦语中，“巴别”或“巴比伦”都是“神之门”的意思。同一词汇（“巴别”）在两种语言里竟会意思截然相反，着实令人费解。其实这是有缘由的。\n公元前586年，新巴比伦国王尼布甲尼撒二世灭掉犹太王国，拆毁犹太人的圣城耶路撒冷，烧毁圣殿，将国王连同近万名臣民掳掠到巴比伦，只留下少数最穷的人。这就是历史上著名的“巴比伦之囚”。\n犹太人在巴比伦多半沦为奴隶，为尼布甲尼撒修建巴比伦城，直到70年后波斯大帝居鲁士到来才拯救了他们。\n亡国为奴的仇恨使得犹太人刻骨铭心，他们虽无力回天，但却凭借自己的思想表达自己的愤怒。\n于是，巴比伦人的“神之门”在犹太人眼里充满了罪恶，遭到了诅咒。\n他们诅咒道：“沙漠里的野兽和岛上的野兽将住在那里，猫头鹰要住在那里，它将永远无人居住，世世代代无人居住。”\n事实上，“巴别”塔早在尼布甲尼撒及其父亲之前就已存在，古巴比伦王国的几位国王都曾进行过整修工作。但外来征服者不断地将之摧毁。\n尼布甲尼撒之父那波博来萨建立了新巴比伦王国后，也开始重建“巴别”通天塔，他在铭文中写道：“巴比伦塔年久失修，因此马尔杜克命我重建。\n他要我把塔基牢固地建在地界的胸膛上，而尖顶要直插云霄。”但尼布甲尼撒之父只将塔建到15米高，尼布甲尼撒自己则“加高塔身，与天齐肩”。\n塔身的绝大部分和塔顶的马尔杜克神庙是尼布甲尼撒主持修建的。\n备受人称赞的“巴别塔”一般指的就是那波博来萨父子修建而成的那一座。\n这座塔的规模十分宏大。公元前460年，即塔建成150年后，古希腊历史学家希罗多德游览巴比伦城时，对这座已经受损的塔仍是青睐有加。根据他的记载，通天塔建在许多层巨大的高台上，这些高台共有8层，愈高愈小，最上面的高台上建有马尔杜克神庙。\n墙的外沿建有螺旋形的阶梯，可以绕塔而上，直达塔顶；塔梯的中腰设有座位，可供歇息。塔基每边长大约90米，塔高约90米。\n据19世纪末期的考古学家科尔德维实际的测量和推算，塔基边长约96米，塔和庙的总高度也是约96米，两者相差无几。“巴别”塔是当时巴比伦国内最高的建筑，在国内的任何地方都能看到它，人们称它“通天塔”。\n也有人称它是天上诸神前往凡间住所途中的踏脚处，是天路的“驿站”或“旅店”。\n人们普遍认为，“巴别”塔是一座宗教建筑。在巴比伦人看来，巴比伦王的王位是马尔杜克授予的，僧侣是马尔杜克的仆人，人民需要得到他的庇护。为了取悦他，换取他的恩典，保障国家城市的永固，巴比伦人将“巴别”塔作为礼物敬献给了他。\n在“巴别”塔里，每年都要定期举行大规模的典礼活动，成群结队的信徒从全国各地赶来朝拜。\n根据希罗多德的记载，塔的上下各有一座马尔杜克神庙，分别称上庙和下庙。\n下庙供有神像。上庙位于塔顶，里面没有神像但金碧辉煌，由深蓝色的琉璃砖制成并饰以黄金。\n巴比伦人按照世俗生活的理想来侍奉他们的神灵。\n大殿内只有一张大床，床上“铺设十分豪华”（如同希腊贵族和罗马贵族，美索不达米亚贵族也是躺着进食），床边有一张饰金的桌子。庙里只住着一位专门挑选出来陪马尔杜克寻欢作乐的年轻美貌的女子。僧侣们使人们相信，大神不时地来到庙里并躺在这张床上休息。只有国王和僧侣才能进入神殿，为马尔杜克服务和听取他的教诲；这种超级神圣的东西是同老百姓无缘的，他们只能远远地敬拜心目中的神灵，因为如果近在咫尺，普通人经受不起大神的目光。据希罗多德记载，神像和附属物品一共用去黄金800泰仑，折合现价约值2400万美元。考古学家曾经在僧侣的一住处发现一只石鸭，上有铭文“准秤一泰仑”，石鸭约重29.68公斤。如果希罗多德的记载可靠，则照此推算，马尔杜克神像连同附件一共重约23700公斤，都是纯金所铸或制作！除了神灵，谁能享受如此高的礼遇？\n考古学家和历史学家认为，巴别塔除了奉祀圣灵还有另外两个用途。其一是尼布甲尼撒二世借神的形象显示个人的荣耀和威严，以求永垂不朽。其二是讨好僧侣集团，换取他们的支持以便稳固江山。美索不达米亚是一个宗教盛行的地方，神庙林立，僧侣众多。僧侣不仅在意识形态上影响着人民，而且掌握着大量土地和财富，如果不在政治上得到他们的支持，恐怕王位也会风雨飘摇。这种忧虑不是多余的，据历史学家研究，尼布甲尼撒之后，新巴比伦王国迅速衰落，以致波斯人不费一兵一卒就占领了巴比伦城，这与失去僧侣集团的支持有莫大关系。\n公元前1世纪的希腊历史学家认为，“巴别”塔是一个天象观测台。新巴比伦人信仰拜星教，星体就是神，在他们的神话中，马尔杜克是木星。新巴比伦王国的僧侣们神秘地登上塔顶，难道真的是侍奉半躺在床上的马尔杜克大神吗？对此希罗多德颇不以为然，现代学者更不相信，说不定正是他们半躺在床上观测天象呢！而且，人类早期的天文知识直接产生于宗教和巫术之中，掌握这些知识的多是僧侣。新巴比伦人取得了当时世界最杰出的天文学成就，这座塔的功劳恐怕不可抹杀。\n也有人认为，“巴别”塔是多功能的。塔的底层是祭祀用的神庙，塔顶则是用于军事瞭望的哨所。\n正是这座塔使得无数英雄为之倾倒。公元前539年波斯王居鲁士攻下巴比伦后，即被“巴别”塔的雄姿折服了。他不仅没有毁掉它，反而要求他的部下在他死后按照“巴别”塔的样子，在墓上建造一座小型的埃特门南基（埃特门南基是“巴别”塔的另一个名字，意为“天地的基本住所”）。然而，后来“巴别”塔终于毁掉了，波斯王薛西斯怨恨巴比伦人民的拼死反抗，恨屋及乌，下令彻底摧毁巴比伦城，“巴别”塔厄运难逃，变成一堆瓦砾。即使如此，以热爱文化名垂青史的亚历山大大帝还是爱慕它的雄姿。公元前331年，他远征印度时，特意来到了“巴别”塔前，英雄与奇观的对话大概只有彼此才能知晓。他一度要修复这座传奇般的建筑，下令全部拆除旧塔，一座更加宏伟壮丽的神塔眼看着有救了。然而，这只是让人空欢喜而已。据说，此时，一只患有疟疾的蚊子叮了他一下，这位文治武功盖世的一代天骄于是一命呜呼，“巴别”塔也就备受冷落了。事实是，这项工程实在是太大了，仅清理废塔就需要一万人工作两个月时间，于是，他只好打消了这个念头。几千年下来，这座塔已变成了废墟，真的应验了犹太人的诅咒。即便如此，几千年后的考古学家科尔德维见到它时，仍由衷地发出了赞叹之声。科尔德维写道：“尽管遗迹如此残破，但亲眼看到遗迹是绝非任何书面的描述可比的。通天塔硕大无比，‘旧约’中的犹太人把它看作人类骄傲的标志，四面是僧侣们朝拜的豪华的殿堂，许多宽敞的仓库，连绵的白墙，华丽的铜门、环绕的碉堡，以及林立的一千座敌楼。当年这样壮丽豪的景象，在整个巴比伦是无与伦比的。”\n\n## 相关故事\n\n巴比伦是一座令人神往的古城，它位于幼发拉底河和底格里斯河的交汇处。早在公元前1830年左右，阿摩利人就以巴比伦为都城，建立了古巴比伦王国。在古巴比伦国最出色的国王汉谟拉比死后，巴比伦不断受到外族的进攻，历经了500多年战乱，直到公元前7世纪末，才在尼布甲尼撒领导下，建立了新巴比伦王国。然而，88年后，新巴比伦王国又被波斯人彻底毁灭。随着巴比伦王朝的覆灭，显赫一时的古城巴比伦，也日渐消失在荒草之中了。\n在新巴比伦王国时期，巴比伦也是古代两河流域地区最壮丽最繁华的都城，巴比伦古城有内外两道城墙，城里最壮观的建筑物，就是尼布甲尼撒王宫通天塔和著名的“空中花园”，以及那座据说让上帝感到又惊又怒的巴别通天塔。\n在波斯人彻底摧毁了巴比伦之后，人们对巴比伦通天塔仍然念念不忘。公元前331年，当亚历山大大帝占领已经荒芜的巴比伦后，他曾经想重建通天塔。但是，单单清除废塔的砖瓦就需要一万人工作两个月。最后他只好放弃了这个计划。\n千百年过去了，不知有多少人一直想找到巴比伦古城遗址。\n1899年3月，一批德国考古学家，在今天巴格达南面50多公里的幼发拉底河畔，进行了持续10多年之久的大规模考古发掘工作，终于找到了已经失踪两千多年，由尼布甲尼撒二世在公元前605年改建后的巴比伦古城遗址。\n考古学家们仍在巴比伦古城遗址上进行着发掘工作。许多宫殿、神庙、街道和住房已经渐渐露出地面。考古学家们正在和历史学家、艺术家们一起，根据发掘出来的文物，复制古城巴比伦大多数建筑物的原型，以便有朝一日能使这座人类宏伟的古城恢复旧观。"],

{"name": "海禁", "documents": ["同义词\n海禁（明代海禁）一般指明朝海禁\n\n明朝海禁是十四世纪时明朝政府对海事进行的一系列限制政策的统称。\n\n元末明初，日本封建诸侯割据，互相攻伐。在战争中失败了的封建主，就组织武士、商人、浪人（即倭寇）到中国沿海地区进行武装走私和抢掠骚扰。\n对此，洪武年间，朱元璋为防沿海军阀余党与海盗滋扰，下令实施自明朝开始的海禁政策\n。\n早期海禁的主要对象是商业（商禁），禁止中国人赴海外经商，也限制外国商人到中国进行贸易（进贡除外）。\n明永乐年间，虽然有郑和下西洋的壮举，但是放开的只是朝贡贸易，民间私人仍然不准出海。而后随着倭寇之患，海禁政策愈加严格，虽起到了自我保护的作用，但大大阻碍了中外交流发展。隆庆年间明政府调整政策，允许民间赴海外通商，史称隆庆开关。海禁的解除为中外贸易与交流打开了一个全新的局面。\n明朝的海禁政策自洪武年间开始到明末海禁的废弛经历了一个多变的 过程。从明初严厉的海禁政策，永乐年间海禁的松弛，永乐后（洪熙—弘治）海禁政策的再强化，嘉靖年间的海禁政策高度强化，隆庆开放和海外贸易的迅速发展， 明末海禁的废弛。这些政策对明朝历史发展产生了深远的影响。\n\n## 背景介绍\n\n传统中国的海外贸易主要有两种形式：一种是由王朝政府经营的朝贡贸易，一种是由民间私人经营的私人海外贸易。朝贡贸易是指海外国家派遣使团到中国朝见王朝皇帝，“进贡”方物，中国王朝则予以官方接待，并根据“怀柔荒远”、“薄来厚往”的原则，回赠进贡国以“赏赐”。“赏赐”物品的总价值大于“进贡”物品总价值的数倍甚至数十倍，“进贡”与“赏赐”之间有着物品交换关系，体现着国家间的经济关系，更体现着国家间的政治关系，经济关系服务于政治关系。中国王朝国家多能积极经营朝贡贸易，确立有明确的政策，制定有完善的制度，设立有具体的经管部门。由政府一手经管操办，是朝贡贸易最为显著的特点，带有明显的政治属性，不是正常的外贸形态。民间私人海外贸易属于民间私营工商业经营，由于中国古代王朝国家很早就确立了抑商的基本国策，所以民间私人海外贸易长时期地受到王朝政府的抑制阻碍、严格管理甚至禁止禁绝，得到王朝政府鼓励扶持的时期十分有限。中国王朝国家时期，民间私人海外贸易缺乏发展的独立性和良好条件，其盛衰兴亡以王朝国家的私人海外贸易政策和管理为前提，是其最为显著的一个特点。\n从元朝开始，日本的民间走私行为发展成地方割据势力支持的海盗，中国的史书也开始出现倭寇的记载。也许是仰仗着战胜忽必烈军队的战绩，日本商人甚至驾驶武装船只来到中国，要求元朝政府开放贸易。元朝政府吸取了战败的教训，不愿再与日本人开战，便采取了海禁措施。\n传统中国朝贡贸易和私人海外贸易的上述特点，在明王朝统治时期表现得尤为突出。\n\n## 原因\n\n### 经济负担\n\n明初，沿袭唐、宋、元朝制度，继续实行政府控制经管的朝贡贸易政策。朝贡贸易导致不断赔本，以致“库藏为虚”，给明王朝带来了越来越沉重的财政负担。朱元璋认为明朝的根本在于农业，而农业的产值足以养活大明王朝。\n\n### 倭寇、走私盛行\n\n江浙一带的百姓，甚至当时居住在泉州一带的外国商团曾经协助过张士诚、方国珍等人与之争夺天下，使他对海上贸易产生了恐惧。\n对于民间私人海外贸易和倭寇的猖獗，明太祖确立了严厉禁止的政策。\n明朝建立不久之后却发生了所谓胡惟庸“通倭叛国”的大案。这件大案的节点是胡惟庸暗中勾结倭寇妄图推翻明政权自立为王。虽然后世史家对此结论多有质疑，但当时倭寇作为一种威胁明朝的外部势力却是不容小觑的。\n\n这一时期，日本进入南北朝时期，许多日本浪人徘徊于中国沿海，从事海盗活动，频频袭扰明朝沿海地区。\n从元代以来，倭寇为患早已见诸记载，如明代谢肇淛的《五杂俎》卷四：“元之盛时，外夷外贡者，至千余国，可谓穷极天地，罔不宾服，惟有日本，倔强不臣。阿拉罕以师十万从征，得还者仅三人。”至明初，日本国仍是“不服王化，冥顽如初”，明朝派使臣赵秩往谕其君，但令人没想到的是日本天皇竟然对赵秩戏言相向，并且杀害了他。\n\n曾经进兵收复海南的大将廖永忠因此向朱元璋上言建议彻底消灭倭寇，加强海防。\n于是，朱元璋对日本国下了通牒：“日本国虽朝实诈，暗通奸臣胡惟庸，谋为不轨，故绝之。命信国公汤和经略沿海，设备防倭。”同时，为了防备沿海奸民与倭寇勾结，朱元璋下令“片板不得下海”\n，禁止老百姓私自出海。\n\n## 过程\n\n### 明初海禁\n\n明太祖下令“寸板不许下海”\n，是明朝建立伊始就制定的遏制中国人对外交往的海禁政策。\n洪武三年（1370），明政府“罢太仓黄渡市舶司”\n。洪武七年（1374），明政府下令撤销自唐朝以来就存在的，负责海外贸易的福建泉州、浙江明州、广东广州三市舶司，中国对外贸易遂告断绝。洪武十四年（1381），朱元璋“以倭寇仍不稍敛足迹，又下令禁濒海民私通海外诸国”\n。自此，连与明朝素好的东南亚各国也不能来华进行贸易和文化交流了。洪武二十三年（1390），朱元璋再次发布“禁外藩交通令”。洪武二十七年（1394），为彻底取缔海外贸易，又一律禁止民间使用及买卖舶来的番香、番货等。洪武三十年（1397），再次发布命令，禁止中国人下海通番。\n到了明成祖永乐年间，由于永乐皇帝靠武力夺了他侄子建文帝的位，而建文帝又下落不明。于是，永乐皇帝组织了一支强大的航海队伍，由三宝太监郑和率领，浩浩荡荡七下西洋，向印度洋沿岸各国宣示大明帝国的威严，使之不敢藏匿建文帝。\n\n郑和下西洋，长期以来被认为是中国航海史上的创举，然而郑和的七下西洋却并未给当时明朝带来多大的经济利益，反而让这种厚往薄来的贡赐体系增加了明朝的经济负担。\n\n### 民间反抗\n\n为了防止沿海人民入海通商，明朝法律规定了严酷的处罚办法:“若奸豪势要及军民人等，擅造三桅以上违式大船，将带违禁货物下海，前往番国买卖，潜通海贼，同谋结聚，及为向导劫掠良民者，正犯比照己行律处斩，仍枭首示众，全家发边卫充军。其打造前项海船，卖与夷人图利者，比照将应禁军器下海者，因而走泄军情律，为首者处斩，为从者发边充军”\n。明政府对参与买卖外国商品的居民也不放过，“敢有私下诸番互市者，必置之重法，凡番香、番货皆不许贩鬻，其现有者限以三月销尽。”\n在这一错误政策的指引下，明政府于洪武十九年（1386）废昌国县，二十年将舟山岛城区和镇外鼓吹两里以外的居民和其他46山（岛）的居民徙迁内陆。本来，明太祖期望海禁政策对海防的巩固能起到决定性作用。然而，由于海禁政策所实施的直接对象是臣民而不是海上反明势力，他不仅不能成为海防的有效手段，甚至在沿海地区激化了一些矛盾。沿海地区人民依海而生，靠海而活，或从事渔业生产，或从事海上贸易。明太祖“严交通外藩之禁”，堵绝了沿海地区人民的正常谋生之路。如“信国公汤和巡视浙江、福建沿海城池，禁民入海捕鱼”\n。他们除起来进行斗争之外，已经没有其他选择。诚如顾炎武所指出:“海滨民众，生理无路，兼以饥馑荐臻，穷民往往入海从盗，啸集亡命”。“海禁一严，无所得食，则转掠海滨”\n。此外，滨海地区的居民还采取了另外一种斗争的手段，逃亡、潜往海外。“国初......两广、漳州等郡不逞之徒，逃海为生者万计”\n。所以，海禁一开始就得不到切实的贯彻，反复发布的海禁令，也说明了这一点。还有一些人干脆参加了民间的对外贸易活动。“缘（沿）海之人，往往私下诸番贸易香货，因诱蛮夷为盗”\n。“东南诸岛夷多我逃人佐寇”\n。\n嘉靖二年五月，日本藩侯的两个朝贡使团在宁波为入贡资格问题爆发了“争贡之役”，使很多无辜的中国军民被杀或被掳，“浙中大震倭自是有轻中国心矣”\n。\n此后，明朝统治者认为“倭患起于市舶，遂罢之”，并对日本“闭绝贡路”，实行更加严厉的海禁政策。是以，朝廷接受建议，封锁了沿海各港口，销毁出海船只，断绝了海上交通。\n\n### 走私泛起\n\n在严厉海禁的政策下，民间私人海外贸易被视为非法行经，被迫走上畸形发展的道路，即被迫转入走私和武装走私，并出现了一些大的海上武装走私集团。嘉靖年间，最大的武装走私集团头目王直，成为众多走私集团的公认首领，“三十六岛之夷，皆听指挥”，拥众数十万，先称“靖海王”，后称“徽王”，甚至“南面称孤”。明王朝对这些武装走私集团进行军事打击，走私集团则团结起来并连结利用日本倭寇进行对抗，从而造成嘉靖四十多年间旷日持久的所谓“倭寇之乱”。倭寇之乱实际上是严禁民间海外贸易政策的必然结果，具有禁止与反禁止斗争的性质。倭寇之乱屡打不绝，甚至越打击反而越剧烈，使明王朝消耗了大量兵力物力，疲于应付，成了心头大患。这一时期严厉禁止民间私人海外贸易的政策，具有很大的落后性，违背了社会经济发展的要求，违背了广大人民尤其是东南沿海地区人民的利益，给明朝社会经济特别是东南沿海地区社会经济的正常发展造成了巨大损失，严重阻碍了正常的中外经济文化交流。\n\n### 海禁解除\n\n世宗死，穆宗继位，认识到“市通则寇转而为商，市禁则商转而为寇”，开始调整严禁民间私人海外贸易的政策。\n隆庆元年（1567年），福建巡抚涂泽民上书曰“请开市舶，易私贩为公贩”（私贩指走私商，公贩指合法商人）。同年，隆庆皇帝（明穆宗）宣布解除海禁，调整海外贸易政策，允许民间私人远贩东西二洋，史称“隆庆开关”。民间私人的海外贸易获得了合法的地位，东南沿海各地的民间海外贸易进入了一个新时期。明朝出现一个比较全面的开放局面。\n\n开放福建漳州府月港（今福建海澄），并以月港为治所设立海澄县，设立督饷馆，负责管理私人海外贸易并征税。督饷馆对私人海外贸易管理的内容主要有：出海贸易的船只不得携带违禁物品；船主要向督饷馆领取船引并交纳引税。此外，对日本的贸易仍在禁止之内，所有出海船只均不得前往日本。若私自前往，则处以“通倭”之罪。\n虽然仍有着诸多管理和限制，开放的月港也只是一处小港口，但民间私人海外贸易至此毕竟得到了朝廷的认可，只要遵守政府的管理限制，民间私人海外贸易就被视为合法经营。政策和制度上的这种局部的和有限度的调整，史称“隆庆开关”。隆庆开放使民间私人海外贸易摆脱了走私非法境地，开始有条件地公开进行和较为正常地发展，并迅速发挥了积极作用。史载隆庆初，仅月港一地，“所贸金钱，岁无虑数十万，公私并赖”，成效明显。\n据学界研究，当时明朝的产品诸如丝织品、瓷器、茶叶、铁器等，广受世界各国欢迎，而许多国家缺乏名优商品能满足明朝的国内需求，只好以白银支付所购明朝商品，引致白银大量流入中国。据估计，明神宗万历元年（1573年）至明思宗崇祯十七年（1644年）的72年间，自葡萄牙、西班牙、日本等国输入明朝的银元，至少在1亿元以上，有力地促进了明朝国内商品经济和社会经济的发展。\n\n## 评价\n\n张立娜：明立之初的海禁作为新王朝立足未稳的防卫之策

争议\n\n中国明清时期实施的海禁政策，通常指控就是限制了沿海民众的正常谋生之路，而早期的麻制渔网质料很差，需三天打渔两天晒网，加上食物储存技术不佳，即使不禁出海也鲜有人“出海”捕渔。定位、星象、渔讯、气象、风象这些在早期皆是大问题，航至台湾都算生死攸关的事，  并不是普通渔民就可以处理的事务 ，\n稍大吨位的帆船也不是个人能负担得了的，所以当时多是利用涨退潮以石沪、中国渔网或鸬鹚、舢舨等从事沿岸捞捕。\n民间贸易虽被禁而在明代的官船、南洋船、县船并未禁绝，对于民间沿海船只也仅强迫改为不利远航的平底船及严禁民造双桅船（渔船不可能大到有双桅船编制），明代沿海船只真正被禁绝的时间不多，严格来说是从没禁近海船只，仅规范远洋船只，却可以有效制止粮食因无德商人因贪图东洋银货外流，\n及违禁品比如铜及铜制钱的外移，造成国内物价不稳定及米价等民生必需品高涨的情形，甚至引发粮食危机，尽管海禁实施的目的是为了防止走私和打击海盗，但实际上，真正受到打击的是本地渔业及国内的沿海贸易，海盗和走私商人的活动反而因为海禁的存在，而更为猖獗，对中国及其周边国家的社会和经济发展，产生相当消极的影响。\n现代普遍的说法是纵贯明朝统治期间，“海禁”一直是明政府对海洋的基本政策，不仅远洋性质的海外民间贸易被禁止，明政府甚至不容许百姓进行捕渔业及沿海贸易。事实上仅沿海驾艇或舢舨的疍家、渔民，在明一代从未消失，直至清初的迁海令，故此说有夸大之嫌，若完全无海运能力，靖难之后就不可能怀疑建文帝有船可逃至海外，就更别说明成祖之后的七下南洋。\n\n从官方的明文诏令看，海禁是有明一代的基本国策，似乎只有隆庆年间有开放漳州月港的明令。但如果以“不禁止即为开放”的标准看，又似乎只有洪武、永乐和嘉靖年间等个别时期有不断重申的海禁令。", "同义词\n海禁（清代海禁）一般指清朝海禁\n\n清政府统一中国以后为了防止郑成功抗清力量与内地的抗清力量发生联系，所以沿袭明朝海禁制度，实行海禁。一般认为，清廷正式全面海禁始于顺治十二年（1655年）。  康熙亲政后，海禁与迁海令在一些地方已有所松动，逐渐“开边展界”，人民回乡复业。清代鸦片战争前（1644-1840年）196年，清初有计28年（1656-1684年）时间近乎全面禁海。与明代相比，清初海禁时间虽然不长却更为严厉，清代官方海外贸易也不多。康熙五十六年（1717年）至雍正五年（1727年）年十年间禁大陆人民赴南洋。1757-1840年“一口通商”。如将部分禁海视为开海，粗略地说，在鸦片战争前的清代，禁海时期约占15%，开海时期约占85%。\n清初海禁，迁海政策是以军事战略为主要出发点的政策，非以遏止对外贸易为目的，但不持久，并不能表示清朝前期以“闭关锁国”为国策；康熙开海之后约一个半世纪间，中国海外贸易的活跃程度和规范化程度都超过了明代的水平，是中国对外贸易的一个发展期。\n有人提出明代中国在对外政策方面基本是开放的，清代则是更为封闭的。也有人反对，认为清代对外贸易政策比明代更具有开放性，还提出闭关和开放等词汇是在西方国家通过工业革命奠定机器大工业生产格局后所出现的一种话语，与其贸易扩张和殖民侵略需要密切相关。\n\n清朝将朝贡与贸易视为两事，各有规则，旦不接受自由贸易原则，这与其对当时欧洲商业扩张与殖民扩张并同推进策略的警觉密切相关；所谓“一口通商”是夸张说法，当时其他海关依然运行。\n\n## 政策介绍\n\n清廷为办铜需要，最初并不禁海，后来为了防止沿海民众通过海上活动接济反清抗清势力（主要为明郑）实行“迁界禁海”，而且较明代更为严厉。顺治十二年（1655年）六月，下令沿海省份“无许片帆入海，违者立置重典”，顺治十八年（1661年），更强行将江、浙、闽、粤、鲁等省沿海居民分别内迁三十至五十里，设界防守，严禁逾越，直到康熙二十年（1681年）三藩之乱平定，康熙二十二年（1683年）台湾告平，清廷方开海禁，先后于二十三至二十五年间设立闽、粤、江、浙四大海关\n，分别管理各自下辖的数十个对外通商口岸的对外贸易事务。康熙年间的开海，是全方位的开海，不但东西两洋，而且一向严禁的赴日贸易也在开放范围之内，较之明代隆庆年间开始的局部开海范围和作用都要大的多，但是，仅仅过了三十多年，全面开海的政策就开始收缩，面对日益严重的“海寇”活动和西方势力在东亚海域的潜在威胁，康熙五十五年（1716年）十月二十五日，康熙召见大臣，提出禁海问题，次年，规定拟定，正式实行南洋禁海。南洋禁海虽然并非全面禁海，但对于正在不断发展的中国民间对外贸易力量无疑是严重的打击。到雍正五年（1727年），雍正在大臣的反复奏请讨论下，担心闽粤地区因洋禁而引发海患，才同意废除南洋禁海令，随即重新开放了粤、闽、江、浙四口通商口岸。\n乾隆年间（1757年），由于洪任辉事件的爆发，乾隆宣布江海关、浙海关、闽海关三个海关下辖口岸不再对西洋船只开放，只留下粤海关允许西方人贸易，对于南洋贸易，并不受此局限。并对丝绸、茶叶等传统商品的出口量严加限制，对中国商船的出洋贸易，也规定了许多禁令，这就是人们通常所说的“一口通商”，此后闭关政策更加严厉，直到鸦片战争的爆发，这种不合理的政策成为了矛盾的焦点。清中期废弃了明末至清初以来形成的传统主动海防观念。抑止了中国的海洋贸易，抑制国内工商业的发展。\n\n但另一方面， 从康熙24年（1685年）到乾隆只留下广州一个口岸的1757年，72年间，到中国贸易的欧、美各国商船有312艘。乾隆关闭三个口岸后，从1758年至1838年鸦片战争前夕，80年间，到达广州海关贸易的商船共5107艘，是开放4个口岸年代的16倍。从管理效率来说，4个口岸开放时，每个口岸每年平均只有1艘西方商船靠岸。只留1个广州口岸时，每年平均靠岸64艘西方商船，效率明显大大提高，使海关管理成本大大降低。\n\n## 海禁起因\n\n清朝海禁政策初期主要目的是防范郑成功反攻。明郑一直长期依靠海上力量与清朝周旋，并曾与英国东印度公司等西方人士合作，出口糖与鹿皮并进口西洋枪炮以增强明郑军队的战斗力，另外更请求英国人训练炮兵，战争时更借用英国炮兵手作战；而郑成功也曾向日本的德川家族请求过援助。因此，清廷实行严厉的迁界令。\n清康熙元年（1662），为防御郑成功的进攻，下令在潮州实行海禁，将沿海居民迁入内地50里；至康熙三年（1664）又再迁徙50里（包括今潮安县庵埠、彩塘、铁铺、官塘一带），禁止出海捕鱼和贸易。康熙五年（1666）撤销澄海县并入海阳县（至八年才恢复）。康熙十年（1671）重申海禁，不准闽粤二省船只过洋。海禁一直延续至康熙二十三年（1684）清政府收复台湾之后始解除，准许澄海、南澳等地居民回原籍耕种，准许对外贸易。海禁给潮州人民带来重大灾难，生产、贸易受到严重破坏。\n\n康熙时，清朝政府虽然开关与外国贸易，但对外国商船的活动极为注意，对逗留外国的中国人也防范极严。康熙下谕地方官要在沿海各地增设炮台，并指出\"海外如西洋等国，千百年后，中国必受其累，国家承平日久，务需安不忘危\"。可见康熙对西方殖民主义者始终是存有戒心的。\n随着当时海上商业的发展，清朝政府对外贸易的限制也日益严格，清朝的闭关自守，最突出的表现是在乾隆，嘉庆时期。\n乾隆二十二年（1757年），由于英国东印度公司等殖民者对中国进行渗透，从这年开始，只准在广州一口通商，不得再往厦门，宁波等地。此外，清朝政府又制定了很多限制外商的禁例（防范外夷规条），如外商不得在广东省城过冬，外商需听中国行商的管束，外商不得在广州自由出入等等。同时也加强了对内地商人的限制，设立了保商制度。保商受政府委派，拥有对外贸易的特权，凡外来的一切人员，船只，货物及纳税等事皆由保商担保。\n加税也是限制与西洋各国通商的办法之一。清朝政府的关税分船钞，货税两种。除康熙时曾一度减轻税额外，以后各种名目的附加税日益增多。乾隆时，清朝即以加重浙江等地海关税以抵制外商北上。同时，清朝政府还先后颁行了禁止五谷，金银，铜觔，丝斤出洋的种种禁令。\n\n## 历史沿革\n\n* 禁海令与迁界令\n\n顺治三年（1646年）编制的《大清律》保留了《大明律》中有关“私出外境及违禁下海”的条文。不过，当时的海禁政策并未真正执行。如康熙十五年（1676年）时任江苏巡抚的慕天颜在《请开海禁疏》也说：“记顺治六七年间，彼时禁令未设”。\n但为了削弱、消灭郑成功等抗清力量，顺治十二年（1655年）浙闽总督屯泰奏请“沿海省份，应立严禁，无许片帆入海，违者置重典。”顺治十三年（1656年）六月，清廷正式颁布“禁海令”，敕谕浙江、福建、广东、江南、山东、天津各省督抚提镇曰：“严禁商民船只私自出海，有将一切粮食、货物等项与逆贼贸易者，……不论官民，俱行奏闻正法，货物入官，本犯家产尽给告发之人。该管地方文武各官不行盘诘擒辑，皆革职，从重治罪；地方保甲通同容隐，不行举首，皆论死。”然而，海禁实行五年未达到预期效果。顺治十八年（1661年），清廷采纳了黄梧的“迁界令”，强令东南沿海居民内迁三十至五十里。迁界令措施对明郑有一定打击成效。不过使得东南沿海地区田园荒芜、百姓流离失所，其后海盗盛行，民生凋敝。\n\n* 开海与展界令\n\n康熙亲政后，一些地方逐渐“开边展界”，人民回乡复业。康熙七年（1668年），郑氏已退守台湾，广东先行松弛海禁。康熙八年（1669年）允许沿海居民复界。平定三藩之乱的战争即将结束之际，福建总督范承谟、姚启圣，江苏巡抚慕天颜，福建巡抚吴兴祚，广东巡抚李士祯等先后上疏，要求废除海禁，准民出海贸易。其中以康熙十五年（1676年）慕天颜的《请开海禁疏》最具代表性，由其中所述“今则盛京、直隶、山东之海船固听其行矣，海洲云台之弃地亦许复业矣，香山、澳门之陆路再准贸贩矣”可知此时北方的沿海省份已解除海禁，唯江浙闽粤四省尚在禁列之中，但江苏和广东的部分地区已弛禁。\n康熙二十二年（1683年），清朝平定台湾，正式展界。所谓“展界”，就是安排在顺治十八年前后被迁界令强迁的沿海居民复归故土。十一月，康熙帝将吏部侍郎杜臻、内阁学士席柱差往福建、广东主持沿海展界事宜，行前谕曰：“迁移百姓事关紧要，当查明原产给还原主，尔等会同总督巡抚安插，务使兵民得所。”\n\n康熙二十三年（1684年），清朝正式开海，准许百姓对外贸易，并在“粤东之澳门（一说广州）、福建之漳州府、浙江之宁波府、江南之云台山”分别设立粤海关、闽海关、浙海关、江海关作为管理对外贸易和征收关税的机构。江浙闽粤四大海关总领各自所在省的所有海关口岸，通常下辖十几至几十个海关口岸。\n康熙五十六年（1717年），由于自开海禁之后，每年造船出海贸易者，多至千余，回来者不过十之五六，不少人留居南洋。清政府因而担心“数千人聚集海上，不可不加意防范”；并认为南洋各国历来是“海贼之渊薮”，于是禁止南洋贸易，即“南洋海禁”。\n南洋海禁之后，本来一度繁荣的对外贸易，又复萎顿。沿海经济日趋萧条，给当地居民造成严重后果，以致有用四五千金建造的大船，任其朽蠹于断港荒岸之间。而生活无着之穷民，被迫逃亡海上，或铤而走险，“或为犯乱”。为此不少人奏请开禁。\n雍正五年（1727），即南洋海禁十年后，清政府再开南洋海禁。但限令出洋贸易之人三年内回国，否则不许回籍。\n同年，由葡萄牙国王第一次直接派遣的使臣始至北京，以往清人称葡萄牙为西洋国，这次称之为博尔都噶尔国，误以为初次入贡，接待十分周到。\n雍正七年，荷兰东印度公司设支店于广州，经营贸易事务。\n* 一口通商\n\n乾隆二十二年（1757年），乾隆南巡，在苏州亲眼目睹洋商船只络绎不绝，引起警觉，导致乾隆对西方殖民活动严加警惕，以海防重地规范外商活动为理由，谕令西洋商人只可以在广东通商，亦即乾隆谕令“本年来船虽已照上年则例办理，而明岁赴浙之船，必当严行禁绝。……此地向非洋船聚集之所，将来只许在广东收泊交易，不得再赴宁波。如或再来，必令原船返棹至广，不准入浙江海口。豫令粤关，传谕该商等知悉。……令行文该国番商，遍谕番商。嗣后口岸定于广东，不得再赴浙省”。\n这一命令，标志着清政府彻底奉行起闭关锁国的政策。但该谕令并不对南洋商人限制，因此当时在南洋的一些西方殖民者仍被允许到闽、浙、江海关贸易，特别是闽海关。例如，乾隆四十六年（1781年）、四十八年（1783年）、五十一年（1786年），嘉庆十二年（1807年）、十四年（1809年），均有西班牙商人从南洋西属菲律宾的吕宋前往厦门贸易。\n乾隆二十四年，受到“洪任辉事件”影响，清廷为了加强对外贸易的管理而制定专门《防范外夷规条》，共有五项，故又称之为《防夷五事》，主要包括：禁制外国人雇人传达信息；外国妇女被严禁来华；严禁在华外商在广州过冬；禁止借外夷的资本及聘请华人役使；及外商到广州后由寓居行商管来检查。\n乾隆四十一年谕旨：“朝鲜、安南、琉球、日本、南洋及东洋、西洋诸国，凡沿边沿海等省份夷商贸易之事皆所常有，各该将军督抚等并当体朕此意，实心筹办。遇有交涉词讼之事，断不可徇民人以抑外夷”。\n* 洪任辉事件\n\n乾隆即位后，在对外贸易方面基本上沿袭了先祖的政策。18世纪中叶，西方资本主义国家已开始工业革命，其海外贸易日益扩张。特别是以英国东印度公司为首的西方商人，一直强烈渴望寻找机会打开中国市场。当时，在中国沿海的4个通商港口，前来进行贸易与投机的洋商日益增多。与此同时，南洋一带也经常发生涉及华人的事端，这些情况很快引起了清朝政府的警觉和反感。\n乾隆五年（1740年），荷兰殖民者在南洋的爪哇大肆屠杀华侨，制造了骇人听闻的“红溪惨案”。消息传来后，举国震惊。同时，澳门等外国人聚集的地方也经常有洋人犯案。另一方面，当时的英国商人为了填补对华贸易产生的巨额逆差，不断派船到宁波、定海一带活动，企图就近购买丝、茶。巧合的是，乾隆皇帝十分热衷于到江南一带巡游。据说当乾隆第二次南巡到苏州时，从地方官那里了解到，每年仅苏州一个港口就有一千多条船出海贸易，其中竟有几百条船的货物卖给了外国人。乾隆还亲眼看到，在江浙一带海面上，每天前来贸易的外国商船络绎不绝，而这些商船大多携带着武器，他不禁担心宁波会成为第二个澳门。于是在1757年南巡回京后，乾隆断然发布了那道著名的圣旨，并规定洋商不得直接与官府交往，而只能由“广州十三行”办理一切有关外商的交涉事宜，从而开始实行全面防范洋人、隔绝中外的闭关锁国政策。\n挑战清朝封关政策，洋商驾船北上告御状就在乾隆闭关锁国的圣旨发布后不久，一起由英国东印度公司挑起的讼案，又进一步坚定了乾隆皇帝的决心，这就是轰动一时的“洪任辉事件”。\n英国人洪任辉，原名詹姆士·弗林特，当时是东印度公司的一名翻译。1755年，在东印度公司的指示下，洪任辉带领商船前往宁波试航，希望扩大贸易范围，开辟新的贸易港。当他们抵达宁波港时，受到当地官员的热烈欢迎。更令他们惊喜的是，浙海关关税比粤海关低，各种杂费也比广州方面少很多。于是，在此后两年中，英国东印度公司屡屡绕开了粤海关，派船去宁波贸易，致使粤海关关税收入锐减。两广总督等官员急忙向乾隆上奏，希望禁止洋船前往宁波贸易。本就对外商没有好感的乾隆皇帝便通知浙海关把关税税率提高一倍，企图通过关税手段让洋商无利可图，使他们不再来宁波贸易。不料英国东印度公司仍不断派商船前往宁波贸易。颇感无奈的乾隆只好在1757年关闭了宁波等地的口岸，只留广州一口通商。\n英国东印度公司当然不愿就此罢休，指示洪任辉再往宁波试航，如达不到目的，就直接航行至天津，设法到乾隆的面前去告御状。乾隆二十二年（1757）六月，洪任辉率船携运大量枪炮军火等违禁品到达宁波，就增税之事与官员激烈争执，闽浙总督杨应琚亲赴宁波调处并奏报中央。十一月，乾隆帝裁示禁止英国商船进入宁波，由两广总督李侍尧传谕各国商人限于广州贸易，提高舟山、宁波、厦门关税一倍，强制起卸军火、帆具上岸。洪任辉粤海关再于1759年由广州出航，并向当地官员假称回国，实际却偷偷地直航宁波。不过，他们的行踪很快就被清朝官员发现，结果洪任辉的船在定海海域被清朝水师拦住，无法驶入宁波。无奈之下，洪任辉便按公司的指示，驾船来到天津。在天津，洪任辉通过行贿手段将一纸诉状送到直隶总督的手中，并由后者转呈乾隆皇帝御览。\n此“状纸”内容长达七项，但主要有四点：第一，状告粤海关监督李永标纵容家人属吏敲诈勒索，征收陋规杂费68项，核银1000多两；第二，状告资元行老板黎光华，拖欠东印度公司货款5万多两；第三，状告广州官吏不循旧例接见洋人，致使家人属吏敲诈勒索；第四，保商制度弊病甚多，延误外国商船正常贸易的进行。\n乾隆皇帝阅后，认为“事涉外夷，关系国体”，命给事中朝诠、福州将军新柱为钦差大臣赴广东会同两广总督李侍尧查办审讯。审理结果认为洪任辉不听浙江地方官的劝告，擅自赴天津告状，不但有辱天朝的尊严，而且怀疑他是“外借递呈之名，阴为试探之计”。\n判决结果为：粤海关监督李永标被革职处分，海关陋规杂费一体废除，同时重申外国商船不可赴宁波贸易。洪任辉明知违反律例，不顾地方官多次警告，擅赴天津告状，判罚圈禁于澳门的前山寨，圈禁期满驱逐回国；代写诉状并呈状词的四川商人刘亚匾，以触犯讼棍教诱主唆、为外夷商谋砌款罪被处死；黎光华家产也公开拍卖抵债，洪任辉供称指使告状的徽州商人汪圣仪，与任辉交结、收受英国大班银一万三百八十两，按交结外国互相买卖借贷财物例治罪，但潜逃未获。\n洪任辉本人被囚禁在澳门三年（1759年12月-1762年11月），刑满后被带到黄埔乘船遣送回英国，终身不得再返回中国。其实，东印度公司可以付一笔赎金，以免去洪任辉的刑期，但东印度公司并没有这么做，可见西方殖民者的险恶。不过，洪任辉在六年里（1760年至1766年）一共赚了8500英镑，其中2000英镑是为了补偿他受囚时所承受的“苦难”。而那位替洪任辉代写诉状的中国人，竟落了个被斩首示众的下场。\n\n乾隆加大锁国力度，外国屡派使团交涉洪任辉事件发生后不久，乾隆感到要防止外商侵扰，除了将对外贸易限制于广州一地外，还必须加强对他们的管理与防范。1759年，朝廷又颁布了《防夷五事》，规定外商在广州必须住在指定的会馆中，并且不许在广州过冬，不得外出游玩，甚至还特别规定“番妇”不能随同前往；而中国商人不得向外商借款或受雇于外商，不得代外商打听商业行情。\n* 马戛尔尼事件\n\n在此后的近百年间，为了打破封闭的中国市场，欧洲诸国如沙俄、英国等国曾多次向中国派出使团，试图说服清朝皇帝改变闭关锁国的国策，但都无功而返。其中，1793年英国向中国派出的马戛尔尼使团，无疑是最著名的一次。\n乾隆57年农历10月，英国商人波朗、亚免、质臣等来广州，奉国王乔治三世命向广东总督报告说：“因前年大皇帝万寿未申祝厘，今遣使臣马戛尔尼等将由天津入贡。”总督郭世勋转奏乾隆帝，乾隆帝谕“准其所请”。\n1793年6月19日，使团船队抵达广州，之后马戛尔尼一行于8月抵达北京。9月14日（八月初十），乾隆帝正式接见使团，马戛尔尼代表英国政府向其提出了七个请求，要求签订正式条约：\n1.派遣驻北京人员管理中英贸易。\n2.允许英国商船至宁波、舟山及两广、天津地方收泊交易。\n3.允许英国商人比照俄国之例在北京设一商馆以收贮发卖货物。\n4.要求在舟山附近小海岛修建设施，作存货及商人居住。\n5.允许选择广州城附近一处地方作英商居留地，并允许澳门英商自由出入广东。\n6.允许英国商船出入广州与澳门水道并能减免货物课税。\n7.允许英人传教至次年。\n\n马加尔尼以书面列举请求，所有浙江、天津通商，京城设立货行，给予舟山小岛，另拨广州地方一处居住，减免广州、澳门往来各税，明定海关税则，俱不准行。马加尔尼提出开放宁波、舟山、天津等地为商埠，由于上述请求涉及割地和免税，因此被清廷拒绝。\n\n嘉庆二十二年（1817年），清廷又将深受海外欢迎的茶叶作为禁止出口的货物之一，谕令皖、浙、闽三省巡抚，“严饬所属，广为出示晓谕，所有贩茶赴粤之商人，俱仍照旧例，令由内河过岭行走，永禁出洋贩运，偿有违禁私出海口者，一经掣获，将该商人治罪，并将茶叶入官。若不实力禁止，仍私运出洋，别经发觉，查明系由何处海口偷漏，除将守口员弁严参外，并将该巡抚惩处不贷。”\n此外，诸如粮食、铁器、硝磺、金银等亦属禁止出口之列。特别是粮食，清廷控制极严，连船员食用也不准多带，每船只能依照人口多少与往返航期，每人一天以一升米为度。\n在17世纪至19世纪世界性市场形成时期，西方经济学者无不认识到“只要输入王国的商品不超过输出，……显然不会使王国丧失什么”。大量的商品输出，不但可以刺激本国生产力的发展，有利于提高生产效率，改进生产工具，而且可以通过航海贸易直接换回大量金属货币，以增加国内商品的流通手段，不断地扩大再生产。这本来是对发展国计民生大有益处的美事，然而，对于将资本主义生产方式视作洪水猛兽的清王朝来说，却是绝对不可取的。它之所以对出海货种屡颁禁令，其原委盖出于此。\n\n## 政策表现\n\n* 限制商品出口\n\n清代，价廉物美的中国商品在世界市场上具有强大的竞争力，不用说那些饮誉遐途的传统商品，即是“内地贱菲无足轻重之物，载至番境，皆同珍贝，是以沿海居民，造作小巧技艺，以及女红针线，皆洋船行销，岁收诸岛银钱货物百十万入我中土”，故而只要政府大力支持航海贸易，不但能左右南洋市场，而且必能在国际关系上继续扮演一个重要的角色。然而令人遗憾的是，清王朝却采取了背道而驰的政策。\n乾隆二十四年（1759年），清廷以“江浙等省丝价日昂”，“不无私贩出洋之弊”为由，下令沿海各地严禁丝及丝织品出口，规定“侥有违例出洋，每丝一百斤发边卫充军；不及一百斤者杖一百，徒三年；不及十斤者栅号一月，杖一百，为从及船户知情不首告者，各减一等。船只货物尽入宫。其失察之文武各官，照失察米石出洋之例，分别议处”。同年，又规定，因为“绸缎等物总由丝觔所成，自应一体察禁”。这一愚蠢而苛刻的禁运政策实施五年后，“不特丝价依然昂贵，未见平减，且遇值蚕事收成稍薄，其价较前更昂”，于是被迫“开禁”但仍只许被批准出海之商船，各配搭土丝及二三蚕丝若干，限额出口，“而头蚕湖丝，绸匹等工页，仍严行查禁”，其绸缎纱罗及丝棉等项，照旧禁止气清廷禁止传统的丝绸出海，使“内地贩洋商船亦多停驾不开”，直接打击了民间航海贸易事业的正常发展。\n\n* 对出海船只的限制\n\n直至15世纪末叶，中国远洋海船尚居世界航业界前茅。但从16世纪开始，在封建专制政权的人为压制下，中国出海船只在技术与质量上就走上了相对落后的道路。顺治十二年（1655年），清廷规定不许打造双檐大船。康熙二十三年（1684年）“开禁”时又规定，“如有打造双桅五百石以上违式船只出海者，不论官兵民人，俱发边卫充军。该管文武官员及地方甲长，同谋打造者，徒三年；明知打造不行举首者，官革职，兵民杖一百。”至康熙四十二年（1703年），虽允许打造双榄船，但又限定“其梁头不得过一丈人尺，舵水人等不得过二十八名。其一丈六七尺梁头者，不得过二十四名”。若“其有梁头过限，并多带人数，诡名顶替，以及讯口盘查不实卖行者，罪名处分皆照渔船加一等“。此外，在康熙三十三年（1694年）还曾规定，严禁“内地商人在外国打造船只气违者严加治罪”。这些清规戒律，使中国木帆船制造业发生了历史性的大逆转。而与之同期，西方的造船行业却在本国政府的全力支持与先进科技的推动下，得到了迅猛的发展。如西班牙，早在16世纪初就拥有1000艘欧洲标准的商船17世纪中叶以前的荷兰，被誉为“海上马车夫”的造船业跃占世界首位。而此后迅速崛起的英帝国，则更以其一支多得数不清的舰船队，在世界各大洋横冲直撞，锐意扩张。在船体结构方面，欧洲的“夹板船”，异军突起。这种船“用板两层”，“厚径尺，横木驾隔，必用铁板两旁夹之，船板上复用铜铅板遍铺”，其坚固程度比当时受掣于官方而无法发展的中国木船高出许多。同时在帆装设备方面，欧洲也融合了传统横帆与阿拉伯三角帆的优点，创造出既有强大采风驱动力，又能在各处风向下使用的“克拉维尔”帆，以后又制造出著名的飞箭式多檐大型远洋快速帆船。特别值得指出的是，18世纪中叶英国工业革命后，随着以钢铁为船壳，以蒸汽机为动力的轮船的问世，世界航海业揭开了划时代的新页。在这种东西方航海力量此消彼长的强烈对比下，尽管在鸦片战争前，中国的中小型传统术帆船在总数量与总吨位上仍有相当的实力，并与明代相比还有所发展，但是站在整个世界航运界来观察问题，这种“实力”或“发展”已成了“明日黄花”。在19世纪50年代的西方人心目中，中国帆船的构造与装备，再也不是几个世纪之前那种令人叹为观止的惊世杰作，而只能是“极为落后”的过时货色了。造船历来是航海的基础，清政府对造船业的种种禁令，无异于对航海业发展的釜底抽薪。\n\n* 限制出海船只携带武器\n\n清王朝在限制航海工具的同时，还于康熙三十三年（1694年）严禁中国出海商船携带武器。康熙五十九年（1720年）又重申：“沿海各省出洋商船，炮械军器概行禁止携带，如地官不严查禁止，致商船仍行私带者，照失察鸟枪例罚俸一年。”雍正六年（1728年），虽有所放宽，但仍规定“鸟枪不得过八杆，腰刀不得过十把，弓箭不得过十副，火药不得过二十斤”。雍正八年（1730年）又放宽到每船带炮不得过二门，火药不得过三十斤。正当清王朝竟力禁限中国商船携带武器之时，欧洲各国的殖民主义海盗船队却在本国政府的全力支持下，以有组织的暴力向东方水域扑来。那些仅有“轻微的防卫的”中国帆船一旦在海上遇到以“火与剑”武装起来的西方舰船，除了束手待毙，坐遭行劫外，别无选择当因此，正如一位西方海盗船长消烈所供称的，连“一只帆船上的小艇都可以毫无困难地对它进行抢劫”。荷兰东印度公司董事会之所以能接二连三地公然#训令公司总督，“应用武力来加以防止”中国在南洋的航业优势，正在于看透了清政府作茧自缚政策的极端愚昧与腐败。由于中国的“和平”商船队在海洋上迭遭焚劫，清政府直到乾隆六十年（1795年）才如梦初醒，意识到“商船出洋携带炮位，原为海面御盗之用。不特各国来广贸易商船，未便禁止，即内地出口商船，概行不准携带炮位，倘通海面匪船行劫，临时不能抵御，岂有束手待毙之理?况在洋行劫者，不独内地匪徒，想各国夷匪亦有纠约为盗，携带炮位出没海洋，为行旅之害。而内地出洋商船无炮位抵御，该商好不保护货物，亦各爱情自命，若拘泥禁止，何以卫商旅而御盗劫?”接着，嘉庆七年（1802年）宣布允许“出海贸易船只”，“携带炮位”，但仍必须“分别梁头丈尺”以定多寡。清廷这些上谕颁发之期，中国沿海与南洋、东洋水域的制海权早就尽操于西方殖民舰队之手。严禁虽缓，但为时已晚，中国木帆船航业的萧条与挨打再也无法挽回。\n\n## 海禁后果\n\n清朝政府对外贸易的限制政策对于维护封建统治起过一定的作用，但在另一方面，却使中国失掉了对外贸易的主动性，使中国封建社会内部已经滋长起来的进步的手工业生产，得不到更进一步的发展。\n\n妨碍了海外市场的扩展，抑制资本的原始积累，阻碍资本主义萌芽的滋长；使中国与世隔绝，没能及时与西方科学知识和生产技术发展生产力进行交流，使中国逐渐落后于世界潮流。\n马克思在1853年为《纽约每日论坛报》写的《中国革命和欧洲革命》一文中，接受了试图向中国推销其商品(特别是鸦片)的英国商人关于中国“闭关锁国”的观点。  这一观点于20世纪50年代纳入了当时中国的主流意识形态，写入了教科书。于是，在大多数大陆中国人头脑中形成了一个“常识”：明清时代“闭关锁国”，“闭关锁国”是造成中国历史上由先进转为落后，以至近代长期挨打的重要原因。就是有学者不同意这一观点也立即被主流意识形态淹没。", "# 海禁\n\n汉语词语\n\n海禁，汉语词语，拼音为hǎi

orders）是日本江户幕府关于禁止对外交通和贸易的法令，于1633-1639年先后发布5次。\n锁国是日本德川幕府实行的外交政策。于1633年颁布第一次锁国令开始，直到1854年美国海军军官培里率舰叩关为止。当初实行政策时锁国亦称呼为海禁，锁国这名字是由兰学者志筑忠雄在1801年提出。当然日本与外国的贸易关系并非完全中止，但仅允许与特定对象进行，包括与荷兰人在长崎出岛进行贸易，而明朝和清朝在长崎亦有贸易来往。此外对马藩与朝鲜、萨摩藩与琉球国以及松前藩与虾夷有贸易关系。\n自16世纪中叶起，葡、西、荷等西欧列强先后来日本传教、贸易。为禁止天主教传播，防止商人富豪与幕府对立，巩固幕藩体制，幕府的对外政策从第二代将军德川秀忠时起，开始向锁国政策转变。1616年，规定欧洲船只只能在平户、长崎两港停泊交易，1624年，拒绝与西班牙通商。30年代后，加快锁国步伐，连续5次发布锁国令。锁国令持续了二百余年，直到1854年美国海军军官培里率舰叩关为止。\n\n## 背景\n\n自从西班牙传教士圣方济各沙勿略来到日本传教（集中在长崎市），不少日本大名及各阶层人民均信奉天主教，后来江户幕府实行禁教令，信徒被迫更改信仰以及被流放到外国。后来为了阻止外国传教，决意与亲天主教的西班牙及葡萄牙断交。\n在安土桃山时代有不少基督教的传教士来航日本并且在日本传教，但是在江户幕府建立以后，将军开始颁布了“禁教令”，从而开始有锁国的念头。面对幕府的禁教令，在九州地方爆发了岛原之乱。后来在德川第三代将军德川家光的统治下完成了锁国的制度。江户时代中期发生了“费顿号事件”，导致了锁国的程度提升到另外一个地步。费顿号事件即一艘英国船伪装成荷兰船并且驶入长崎胁持长崎奉行所里面的职员要求给予食物、水和柴薪，当长崎奉行交出这些物品后便扬长而去的事件，这件事件使得长崎奉行松平康英切腹。震怒的幕府下达了“异国船打退令”，又称“无二念打退令”，下令所有外国船只一靠近日本本土就予以炮弹攻击，促使了日本的完全锁国。\n\n## 目的\n\n德川幕府实行锁国政策的主要目的，是为了巩固和加强幕府的统治，维护封建的剥削制度。日本实行锁国政策，制止了西南大名利用海外贸易增强割据实力的倾向，巩固了德川幕府在全国的统治地位。\n其次，全面禁止日本商人出海进行贸易，切断了国内商业资本与海外市场的直接联系，抑制了商品经济的发展，使小农经济免受冲击，以维护封建的剥削制度。\n再次，在日本的历史上，被压迫的群众曾以宗教为旗帜进行过武装暴动，由此可根除宗教在日本农民中的影响，巩固自己的统治地位。\n\n## 要求\n\n### 限制活动\n\n1、禁止日本船出海贸易和日本人与海外往来，偷渡者要处以死刑；\n2、取缔天主教的传教活动，对潜入日本的传教士应该予以告发和逮捕，以防止天主教在日本的蔓延；\n3、对驶抵日本的外国船只实行严密的监视，贸易活动也由幕府进行严格的管制。\n这样，日本的“锁国体制”最终确立起来了。\n\n### 对外贸易\n\n日本锁国时期的对外贸易大致上可分为两种：\n第一种是由幕府直接控制，在长崎负责荷兰以及中国之间的贸易。\n第二种是由藩主，与该国特定的贸易，即对马藩的宗氏与朝鲜、萨摩藩岛津氏与琉球国、松前藩松前氏与虾夷（北海道）的对外贸易，这四个港口开放，被日本称为四口。\n一、除特许船只以外，严禁其他船只驶往国外。\n二、除特许船只以外，不得派遣日本人至外国。如有偷渡者，应处死罪，偷渡船及船主，一并扣留。\n三、以去外国并在外国构屋营居之日本人，若返抵日本应即处以死罪。但如在不得已之情势下，被迫逗留外国，而在五年之内归来日本者，经查明属实，并系恳求留住日本者，可予宽恕。如仍欲再往外国者，即处死罪。\n四、如发现有耶稣教蔓延之处，汝二人①应即前往戒谕。\n五、发现耶稣教教士者，应予以褒赏。告发人之功绩优良者，赏银百枚。其他告发人，依其忠行情节，酌量褒赏。\n六、外国船来到，应即呈报江户。并应按照往例，通告大村藩主，请其派遣监视舰船。\n七、如有发现传播耶稣教之“南蛮人”或其他邪言惑众者，应即押解至大村藩之牢狱。\n八、外国船所在各种货物不得由某一地方全部包购。\n九、禁止官吏在长崎直接购买外国船之货物。\n十、外国船之货物应列单呈报江户。但可以按照往例令其交易，不必等待江户批示。\n十一、外国船装来之生丝，应于确定价格后，全部分配于五处②。\n十二、生丝以外之其他各种货物，应在生丝价格确定后，按丝价标准，各立行情，进行交易。（附：货物之买卖，限于价格确定后二十日内交易完毕。）\n十三、外国船之归期，限于9月20日以前，迟到之船，其归期限自驶到之日起，五十日以内。\n十四、禁止外国船将卖剩之货物寄存于日本，并禁止日本人接受此等寄存。\n十五、五处之商人限于7月20日以前抵达长崎。迟到者不列入分配额中。\n十六、驶抵萨摩、平户及其他任何之港口，交易必须按照长崎之丝价，在长崎丝价未确定前，不准交易。\n上列诸条，应各遵守查照办理。\n宽永10年2月28日

危害\n\n德川幕府实行锁国政策，从其主观动机来说，无疑为了防范西方殖民主义势力的渗透、维护日本的国家独立，从客观的效果来看，在一定的时期内也确实起到了预期的作用。但从长远看，这种政策只能延缓民族危机的来临，而其最终的结果必然酿成更为严重的危机。因为：\n（1）在日本实行锁国的200多年间，西方世界发生了巨大变化，先是资产阶级革命，资本主义制度的确立，再到工业革命的开展，使西方国家的实力增强；而日本由于实行锁国政策，贸易停滞，使国内经济几乎与世界市场隔绝，严重地影响了新的资本主义因素的发展，延缓了封建经济解体和资本原始积累的进程。同时与外国交流终止，使江户时期的日本文化失掉了开阔与雄伟的精神。这就使本来已经落后的日本，进一步被资本主义的西方抛在后面。\n（2）锁国政策巩固了幕藩封建体制，当这一体制逐渐成为社会经济发展的障碍时，锁国政策的反动作用也就更加明显了。\n\n##

幕府态度\n\n在颁布“异国船打退令”后，日本锁国迈向了完全的态势。后来却发生了“摩利逊号事件”，使得幕府的态度改变。一艘美国船“摩利逊号”接载日本难民前往九州却差点遭受炮击，导致了日本国内的不满。后来幕府为了镇压反对锁国的人们，下令予以逮捕，也就是“蛮社之狱”。在清朝鸦片战争战败后，日本无法坚持锁国制度，所以颁布“薪水给予令”，让所有异国船在来到日本本土后禁止上陆，只是提供柴薪、食物和水后离开。\n\n###

海禁\n海禁（又称洋禁），是一种锁国政策，旨在禁止民间私自出海，有谓「片板不许下海，艨艟巨舰反蔽江而来，寸货不许下番，子女玉帛恒满载而去」，也限制外国商人前往本国通商。具体实施随著时间变迁而有张有弛，即「严禁」及「弛禁」之分。海禁本来的目的是为消灭反叛势力、打击海盗及走私，保障社会稳定的初衷。日韩亦有此政策，朝鲜王朝皆执行海禁逾200年，规定指定国籍和商人外，官民禁止与别国商人贸易。然而，实际上真正受到打击的是本国经济、对外的贸易及渔业、外交关系，以及科技知识的学习与交流，因此历代以来各政府的海禁最后都不了了之，并最终以开港通商收场。此外海盗和走私商人的活动亦反而因为海禁而更加猖獗，对本国及其周边国家的社会和经济发展产生了消极影响。\n中国历史上，海禁横跨元、明、清三个时代。元国曾经4次实行海禁，每次持续时间都比较短，共约11年，这时对海外贸易并未产生全局性的负面影响。而明清两国的海禁，始于明国不堪海盗集团的骚扰，其后清国为了防堵反清势力延续，这次不仅在政策上有所强化，而且持续时间长达多年。此时正值大航海时代，中国的贸易与外交的缺席，海禁也成为别的境外势力崛起的契机，如东南亚陶瓷业等等因此得到发展。另一方面，藩属国例如琉球等国家，亦因为海禁的关系，利用独占与中国中转贸易的契机而抽取大量利益。\n##明朝海禁\n###海禁的实施\n「海禁」是明朝的一项锁国性质的基本国策，从洪武年间到隆庆年间，实行了近200年，纵贯大半个明朝。形成了成熟的海禁政策与概念。明朝海禁严格禁止人民对外通商贸易，限制外国人到中国进行贸易。明朝唯恐禁海不力，有关海禁的诏令每过几年就会重申一遍。\n明朝海禁时期规定人民不但“片板不许入海”，甚至民船造得稍大一些就是违法。《大明律》规定：“若奸豪势要及军民人等，擅造三桅以上违式大船，将带违禁货物下海，前往番国买卖，潜通海贼，同谋结聚，及为向导劫掠良民者，正犯比照已行律处斩，仍枭首示众，全家发边卫充军。其打造前项海船，卖与夷人图利者，比照将应禁军器下海者，因而走泄军情律，为首者处斩，为从者发边充军。”\n海禁的起源则是跟海盗有关，元末起义军领袖之一的朱元璋击败其他义军，于公元1368年建立明朝。一方面，明朝前期倭寇猖獗。据《明史》及《明实录》记载，仅1368年至1374年七年间，倭寇对中国沿岸的侵扰次数就多达二十三次。\n此时正值日本的南北朝内战，流离失所的日本平民为逃避战乱，纷纷流亡海上。1392年（明洪武25年），日本北朝的足利氏吞并南朝，不少南朝遗臣相继逃亡出海，与日本浪人组成武装，形成倭寇，侵扰中国沿岸地区。另一方面，曾割据江南沿海州县的张士诚和方国珍，自被朱元璋击败后，其部下亡命海上，勾结日本浪人，侵扰山东、南直隶、福建等沿海地区。有鉴于苏、松、常、嘉、湖等州是张士诚的旧地，朱元璋因而对以上地区采取歧视性政策，所征田赋较其他地区高出十倍以上，当地百姓不堪其苦，流亡他乡，或作为倭寇向导。此外，闽浙大族亦为了利益私通倭寇。\n为了防止沿海反叛势力私通倭寇，洪武三年（1370年），明廷“罢太仓黄渡市舶司”；洪武四年（1371年）十二月颁布「禁海令」，规定：“……仍禁濒海民不得私出海”；洪武七年（1374年），明朝撤销了自唐朝起就存在的负责海外贸易的福建泉州、浙江明州（今宁波）、广东广州三处市舶司。\n永乐年间虽有郑和下西洋，但海禁政策较洪武年间更为严苛。永乐二年(1404年)诏令“原有海船者，悉改为平头船，所在有司，防其出入”。永乐五年（1407年）甚至在安南也实行海禁：“亦不许军民人等私通外境，私自下海贩鬻番货”。\n###倭寇侵袭\n明朝洪武、永乐年间，因当时明朝国力较强，没有造成重大影响。同时，洪武、永乐年间大力打击海上的商业活动，阻碍海上贸易发展。time=2021-10-12。\n### 隆庆开港\n直到16世纪中叶，明廷为了重建海上秩序，对海禁存废产生严重分歧。隆庆元年（1567年），福建巡抚涂泽民请开海禁并获准。但是，明朝仅开放了福建漳州的月港一处口岸，而且只允许泉州和漳州的商人对外贸易date=2021年8月，time=2021-08-31T18:10:34+00:00，史称「隆庆开关」。由于政府部分开放海禁，得以缓解。\n##清朝海禁\n清前中期的对外贸易，包括延续前明的11年传统朝贡贸易时期（1644-1655年），29年的海禁时期（1655-1684年）和其后158年的开海贸易时期，其中开海贸易时期包括73年的四口通商（1685-1757年）和85年的一口通商（1757-1842年）\n###禁海与迁界\n顺治三年(1646年)编制的《大清律》保留了《大明律》中有关“私出外境及违禁下海”的条文。顺治四年(1647年)因广东平定颁发的“恩诏”中说：“广东近海，凡系漂洋私船，照旧严禁”。顺治十年的一份户部题本说：“自我朝鼎革以来，沿海一带，俱有严禁”。不过，当时的海禁政策并未真正执行，清人根本不知有海禁。甚至康熙十五年(1676年)时任江苏巡抚的慕天颜在《请开海禁疏》也说：“记顺治六七年间，彼时禁令未设”。\n为了削弱、消灭郑成功等抗清力量，早在顺治十二年（公元1655年），浙闽总督屯泰奏请“沿海省份，应立严禁，无许片帆入海，违者置重典。”顺治十三年（1656年）六月，清廷正式颁布“禁海令”，敕谕浙江、福建、广东、江南、山东、天津各省督抚提镇曰：“严禁商民船只私自出海，有将一切粮食、货物等项与逆贼贸易者，……不论官民，俱行奏闻正法，货物入官，本犯家产尽给告发之人。该管地方文武各官不行盘诘擒辑，皆革职，从重治罪；地方保甲通同容隐，不行举首，皆论死。”然而，海禁实行五年未达到预期效果。\n顺治十六年（公元1659年），郑成功率领南明军队北伐失利后，退守厦门，清廷趁明军新败之际，派遣安南将军达素率领清军进入福建，并将浙江明安达礼属下八旗军以及沿海各省绿营水军，都归达素亲自指挥，企图消灭郑成功麾下明军，史称「厦门战役」。在该战役中，郑成功麾下明军大胜，清廷沿海各省水师在此战中几乎全军覆灭，其海上力量受到毁灭性打击，故此在顺治十八年（1661年），清廷采纳了黄梧的“迁界令”，将东南沿海居民内迁三十至五十里，村社田宅悉皆焚弃。康熙年间早期也曾多次重申海禁政策。\n### 展界与弛禁\n康熙亲政后，一些地方逐渐“开边展界”，人民回乡复业。康熙七年(1668年)，郑氏已退守台湾，广东先行松弛海禁。康熙八年（1669年）允许沿海居民复界。平定三藩之乱的战争即将结束之际，福建总督范承谟、姚启圣，江苏巡抚慕天颜，福建巡抚吴兴祚，广东巡抚李士祯等先后上疏，要求废除海禁，准民出海贸易。其中以康熙十五年(1676年)慕天颜的《请开海禁疏》最具代表性，由其中所述“今则盛京、直隶、山东之海船固听其行矣，海洲云台之弃地亦许复业矣，香山、澳门之陆路再准贸贩矣”可知此时北方的沿海省份已解除海禁，唯江浙闽粤四省尚在禁列之中，但江苏和广东的部分地区已弛禁。\n康熙二十二年（1683年），清朝平定明郑台湾，正式展界。所谓“展界”，就是安排在顺治十八年前后被迁界令强迁的沿海居民复归故土。十一月，康熙帝将吏部侍郎杜臻、内阁学士席柱差往福建、广东主持沿海展界事宜，行前谕曰：“迁移百姓事关紧要，当查明原产给还原主，尔等会同总督巡抚安插，务使兵民得所。”\n康熙二十三年（1684年），清朝正式开海，准许百姓对外贸易，并在“粤东之澳门（一说广州）、福建之漳州府、浙江之宁波府、江南之云台山”分别设立粤海关、闽海关、浙海关、江海关作为管理对外贸易和征收关税的机构。江浙闽粤四大海关总领各自所在省的所有海关口岸，通常下辖十几至几十个海关口岸。\n### 定点通商与缩禁贸易\n康熙五十六年(1717年)，清廷禁止南洋贸易，但并未禁止东洋贸易和西洋贸易。雍正五年(1727年)，时隔十年后清廷重新开放南洋贸易。乾隆二十二年（1757年），乾隆帝以海防重地规范外商活动为理由，谕令西洋商人只可以在广东通商1=乾隆谕令“本年来船虽已照上年则例办理，而明岁赴浙之船，必当严行禁绝。……此地向非洋船聚集之所，将来只许在广东收泊交易，不得再赴宁波。如或再来，必令原船返棹至广，不准入浙江海口。豫令粤关，传谕该商等知悉。……令行文该国番商，遍谕番商。嗣后口岸定于广东，不得再赴浙省”这一上谕只是让“外洋红毛等国番船”、“番商”只在广东通商，不得再赴浙江等地，而不是一些资料中所说的关闭江、浙、闽三海关，更不是“广州一口通商”。。但是实际上，当时在南洋的一些西方殖民者仍被允许到闽、浙、江海关贸易，特别是闽海关。例如，乾隆四十六年(1781年)、四十八年(1783年)、五十一年(1786年)，嘉庆十二年(1807年)、十四年(1809年)，均有西班牙商人从南洋吕宋到厦门贸易。\n###被迫开海\n第一次鸦片战争后，由于清朝战败，为了保全国家，除了被迫割地赔款，随之也被迫全面解除海禁，自此，清朝长达200多年的海禁政策结束。\n## 明清海上贸易\n明末隆庆开关后，尽管明朝对海上贸易秩序的控制薄弱，但海上贸易仍有所发展，郑氏集团的规模为此提供了充分证明。东南亚欧洲殖民当局的一些文献从另一方面提供了明末海上贸易有所发展的证据。据统计，万历十六年以前，从广州出口到马尼拉的货物总值为22万西元，其中丝货量值为19万西元；万历二十一年的丝货值达到25万西元。崇祯九年以前，每艘开往墨西哥的“大帆船”，登记运载中国丝货为300—400箱至500箱。万历八年至十八年，每年运往果阿的丝货为3000石，价值银为24万两，利润达36万两；崇祯九年，丝货达6000石，赢利72万两。当时，不仅日本、葡萄牙和西班牙人穿上了中国丝绸，而且东南亚土著、墨西哥印第安人和黑人也都普遍穿著中国的丝绸与棉布服装。\n清初康熙开海前，中国的海上贸易仍维持相当大的规模。康熙开海后，海上贸易量持续增长，贸易港口扩大，贸易国家、商船数量、进出口商品数量和贸易商品流通量值均不断增加，对海上贸易的监管也较明代有效得多。\n##

。又称洋禁。元朝海禁没有打断中国封建社会商品经济发展的自身进程，为明朝资本主义的萌芽提供了便利条件。但元朝海禁开中国海禁之先例，对后世产生了一定消极影响，它表明封建统治者试图加强控制海外贸易，这一倾向被明清所继承和强化，从而阻碍了中国对外贸易的进一步发展。从这一点来讲，元朝海禁仍具有不可忽视的影响。\n\n## 定义\n\n中国海禁指禁止外国人到中国沿海通商和中国人到海外经商的禁令。明清两代都有过这种禁令。与普遍的认为不同，历史事实证明，中国海禁的开端是从蒙元时代开始，登峰造极于满清。\n自汉代中国开始有明确记载我国通过海道与其它国家进行贸易以来，随着海外交通的发展，海外贸易有了长足的进步，到元朝更是规模空前。元朝海外交通的发达为其开展海外贸易奠定了坚实的基础。“皇元混一声教，无远弗届，区宇之广，旷古所未闻。海外岛夷无虑数千国，莫不执玉贡深，以修民职;梯山航海，以通互市。中国之往复商贩于殊庭异域之中者，如东西州焉。”\n元朝海外政策同唐宋相比，更具有开放性，但元朝也曾出现过“禁商下海”的海禁，并曾罢废过市舶机构，中国海禁自元朝开始，后被明清所继承和强化。海禁虽然对元朝海外贸易没有产生重大影响，但它表明封建统治者试图加强对海外贸易的控制。\n\n## 过程\n\n元朝海禁时兴时废，从元世祖末年起，到英宗至治二年(1322年)结束，其间出现四次海禁。第一次海禁起于至元二十九年(1292年)八月，世祖“以征爪哇，暂禁两浙、广东、福建商贾航海者”开始，至元三十一年(1294年)，“成宗诏有司勿拘海舶，听其自便”结束。第一次据元史《世祖本纪》记载，发生于至元二十九年(1292)八月，元世祖“癸未，以征瓜哇，暂禁两浙、广东、福建商贾航海者，俟舟师已发后，从其便。”严格说来根本不算是海禁，只是战争时期为防止海商向爪哇通报信息，出售军械，元政府实行的军事统筹政策。元朝海军船队一向爪哇出发，禁令随之作废。第二次海禁于大德七年(1303下)以“禁商下海”取消市舶机构开始，到武宗至大元年(1308年)，“复立泉府院，整治市舶司事。”市舶机构自唐中叶以来，一直是管理海外贸易的主要机构，其兴废与海禁密切相关，因此，“整治市舶司事”表明第二次海禁结束。第二次是由朱清、张瑄贿官事件引发的整顿吏治风潮导致的大德七年关闭市舶司暂行整顿。朱清张瑄是当时海寇集团头目，在伯颜下江南时出力甚多，被元朝授以重职，掌管海运。这两人“恃其势位，多行不法”， 贿赂江浙行省平章脱脱未遂，被脱脱揭发，事败伏法。据宋本《舶上谣》记载“朱、张死去十年过，海寇雕零海贾多。南风六月到岸酒，花股篙丁奈乐何。”很明显，朱张集团的垄断被打破，海外贸易局面为之一新。第三次海禁自武宗至大四年(1311年)取消市舶提举司开始，史载“至大四年罢之，禁下番船只”。仁宗延枯元年(1314年)七月“诏开下番市舶之禁”，复立市舶提举司。第三次是武宗至大四年(1311)取消市舶提举司。据元史《百官志》记载，“至大四年罢之，禁下番船只”，然而延祐元年很快就“诏开下番市舶之禁”。最后一次海禁从元延佑七年(1320年)四月以英宗“罢市舶司，禁贾人下番”开始，英宗至治二年(1322年)三月，“复置市舶提举司于泉州、庆元、广东、三路，”最后一次海禁时间最短，延祐七年四月，元英宗“罢市舶司，禁贾人下蕃”，然而两年后便“复置市舶提举司于泉州、庆州、广东三路”。第四次海禁结束。此后至元灭亡，市舶机构没有再发生变化。元朝海禁政策间断地总计有11年时间。\n\n## 原因\n\n海禁并不是元朝的既定国策，但是为什么会出现前前后后的四次海禁呢？\n其原因有以下几个方面:\n一是因元统治者对外征伐而导致海禁，尤以第一次最为明显。元世祖并不满足于对南宋的征服，积极向外扩张势力。他首先将目标锁定在占城，由于占城人民的坚决反抗，终未成功。随后元朝统治者又把目光对准了爪哇。因爪哇在南海诸国中实力较强，元世祖认为只要征服爪哇，则“其余小国即当自服”。至元十六年(1279年)、十七年(1250年)两次遣使爪哇，但均未成功。至元十八年(1281年)十一月，元世祖又“诏谕爪哇国主，使亲来勤”，被拒绝。至元二十六年(1289年)，爪哇国王葛达那加刺将元朝使臣孟琪默面送回，忽必烈以此为借口，于至元二十九年(1292年)二月，“以泉府太卿亦黑迷失，邓州旧军万户史弼、福建行省右皿高兴并为福建行中书省平章政事，将兵征爪哇。”但因跨洋作战，且受爪哇国内政治斗争影响，最后终于失败。史载至元三十年(1293年)十二月，“平章政事亦黑迷失、史弼、高兴等无功而还，各杖而耻之，仍没其家费三之一。”在战争期间，为防止海商向爪哇通报信息，出售军械，元政府实行了海禁，但这种海禁往往随着战争的结束而解除。\n二是为约束权豪、势要经营海外贸易，维护元朝的“官本船”制度。元朝“官本船”制度是元朝海外贸易的一个重要特点，是中国古代官方控制和经营海外贸易的一个典型。所谓“官本船”制度，即由官方出钱出船，委托商人经营的一种官本商办的海外贸易模式。早期由政府贷款给海商进行海外贸易，后由政府直接经营。至元二十二年(1285年)正月，卢世荣提出了“于泉、杭二州立市舶都转运司，造船给本，令人商贩，官有其利七，商有其三”的新建议，这一建议得到元世祖的认可。《元史·食货志》将其称为“官自具船、给本，选人人蕃，贸易诸货。其所获之息，以十分为率，官取其七，所易人得其三”。同时元朝政府又规定“凡权势之家，皆不得用己钱人蕃为贾，犯者罪之，仍籍其家产之半”。由于元朝海外贸易获利甚丰，元朝政府不时颁布禁令，禁止私商下海，妄图垄断海外贸易的高额利润。史载“禁私贩海者，拘其先所蓄宝货，官买之;匿者，许告，没其财，半给告者’。在推行“官本船”制度的过程中，元朝初年那些海商大贾如朱清、张暄等人，拥有众多海船，每年获利无数，这些人又贿赂朝中官员，相互勾结，这无疑对元朝“官本船”的海外利润构成威胁。为垄断海外贸易的巨额利润，政府往往对其进行约束、限制，当这种限制走向极端时，便发展为海禁。在元朝“官本船”制度较为严格的时候，也正是海禁较多的时候。由于“官本船”制度在实施过程中遇到不少困难，在英宗至治三年(1323年)，政府才宣布，“听海商贸易，归征其税。’\n三是约束违禁品的外流。元朝禁止出口的商品较多，元朝政府规定:“诸市舶金银铜钱铁货、男女人口、丝绵段匹、销金缕罗、米粮军器等，不得私贩下海，违者舶商、船主、纲首、事头、火长各杖一百七，船物没官，有首告者，以没官物内一半充赏，廉访司常加纠察。”《元史》中有多处多次声明严禁违禁品下蕃，如至元二十九年(1289年)正月“禁商贾私以金银航海。”延佑元年(1314年)元朝政府重新修订颁布了新的《市舶法则》，扩大了出口商品的禁限种类。尤其是金银被元朝贵族视为珍品，且开采量小，弥加珍贵，往往作为赏赐物赐与诸王、大臣等。自世祖后，元朝统治者用于赏赐的金银数量大为增加。如大德十一年(1307年)六月，仁宗“以金二千七百五十两，银十二万九千二百两，钞万锭，币帛二万二千二百八十匹奉兴圣宫，赐皇太子亦如之”。另外，铜钱的大量外流也造成元朝纸币的贬值。因此，有元一代对这些违禁品管理较为严格，当这些违禁品外流严重时，便通过禁海的手段阻止。\n元朝每次海禁的时间并不长，最短一次不足两年，即第四次(1320年一1322年)，最长一次即第二次也不过五年(1303年一1308年)。之所以禁后不久即开，原因又在何处？\n一是对外征伐的结束。元朝对外扩张主要集中在元世祖在位期间。元世祖征爪哇失败后，成宗一上台就“诏有司勿拘海舶，听其自便”，从而结束了大规模的对外战争。自此以后，元朝再未因对外战争导致海禁。\n二是为满足元朝统治者对海外奢侈品的需求，不能长期海禁。元朝统治者来自较为偏僻的蒙古大草原，对奇珍异物的奢欲，较之唐、宋王朝更甚一筹，他们提出了“以损中国无用之货，易远方难制之物”的方针。”早在至元十年(1273年)春正月，即“诏遣扎术呵押失寒，崔构持金十万两，命诸王阿不合市药狮子国”。至元十九年(1282年)，“用中书左承耿仁言，以钞易铜钱，令市舶司以钱易海外金珠货物。”为了满足统治者的需求，甚至不惜发动战争。对此，明人丘溶曾说:“元世祖在位之日，击缅甸，击爪哇，击占城，击日本，殆无虚岁……缅甸接于百夷，占城隔于交趾，爪哇、日本皆在炎天涨海之外，地势不相接也，兵刃不相及也，而必征之何哉?利其所有耳。盖闻此诸国多珠贝宝石之类，欲得之耳。’颇为深刻地揭示了元统治者的奢欲之大。\n三是元朝政府为解决日益严重的财政危机，维护封建专制政权，不得不重视海外贸易带来的巨额利润，不可能长期海禁。海禁就其影响而言，由于其海禁持续时间短，政策也不具有延续性等特点，这使得海禁对元朝的海外贸易没有产生全局性的影响。元朝海外贸易的繁荣大大丰富了国内市场，也促进了江南沿海一带商品经济的发展，而“商品生产和发达的商品流通，即贸易，是资本产生的历史前提”。元朝海禁没有打断中国封建社会商品经济发展的自身进程，为明朝资本主义的萌芽提供了便利条件。但是，元朝海禁毕竟是唐宋开放政策到明清海禁政策的过渡，显示中国封建社会的对外政策开始有所转向。元朝海禁开中国海禁之先例，对后世产生了一定消极影响，它表明封建统治者试图加强控制海外贸易，这一倾向被明清所继承和强化，从而阻碍了中国对外贸易的进一步发展。从这一点来讲，元朝海禁仍具有不可忽视的影响。", "# 海禁\n\n宋代时期打击走私的运动\n\n宋代海禁，指的是宋代时期为了打击走私和保护国家安全，部分的限制居民出海经商。\n宋太宗赵光义于太平兴国初年（985年）开始海禁，宋人出海需到两浙市舶司申请许可。\n至宋神宗元丰二年（1079年），宋神宗取消禁令。## 背景\n\n在封建社会，专制统治者为维护自己的统治地位与自身的根本利益，严禁沿海人民私自出海走私与海外国家开展贸易活动。如要出海，则需统治者的文书才可出海。\n\n## 过程\n\n### 北宋时期\n\n宋朝自宋太宗赵光义时便开始了全面海禁。据《宋史》里的《太宗本纪》记载，雍熙二年（985年）九月赵光义“禁海贾”\n，又据《宋史·食货志》记载，赵光义于太平兴国初年（976年）规定私自与海外诸国贸易者，满一百钱以上判罪论处，十五贯以上就在脸上刺字发配流放到海岛，也就是说赵光义不止是全面禁止海外贸易，甚至连陆上与外国贸易也全面禁止，他还并不是一时心血来潮，而是作为一项长期国策来实行。淳化五年（994年）还特意重申禁令，惩罚的法令也十分严酷，满一百钱就属于犯罪，超出十五贯就要在脸上刺字发配流放到海岛；后来又规定四贯以上判一年徒刑，二十贯脸上刺字发配当地当役兵。\n赵光义之后，宋朝海禁政策趋于宽松，但并不意味海禁政策的取消。据学者陈高华在《北宋时期前往高丽贸易的泉州舶商》一文指出，宋仁宗时期有关市舶的条法《庆历编敕》和《嘉祐编敕》，都明文规定：“客旅于海陆商贩者，不得往高丽、新罗及登莱州界。”，而宋神宗时期的《熙宁编敕》也规定：“往北界高丽新罗并登莱界商贩者各徒二年。”，直到宋神宗元丰二年（1079年）才取消禁令。\n宋神宗之后，宋朝海外贸易开展比较正常。\n\n### 南宋时期\n\n然而，北宋灭亡之后，南宋初期，宋高宗出于国家安全考虑实行海禁，据《宋史·高宗本纪》记载，他在建炎四年（1130年）七月己未，“禁闽、广、淮、浙海舶商贩山东，虑为金人乡导”\n。不仅如此，他还在绍兴二年（1132年）八月下诏没收沿海百姓的海船，每年更换一次，守卫海道险要，实质与海禁并无多大差别\n。又据《宋史·食货志》记载宋高宗于“绍兴十二年（1142年），兴榷场，遂取腊茶为榷场本，凡胯、截、片、铤，不以高下多少，官尽榷之，申严私贩入海之禁。”也就是禁止腊茶海外贸易。\n\n宋高宗之后，宋孝宗开始调动军事力量打击海上私商集团。据《宋史·孝宗本纪》记载，孝宗于乾道五年（1169年）二月乙未，“命楚州兵马钤辖羊滋专一措置沿淮、海盗贼”\n，宋廷又于宋宁宗嘉定二年（1209年）五月乙巳，“命沿海诸州督捕海寇”\n。\n\n总的看来，南宋海外贸易还是趋于正常。不过也有例外情形，即宋理宗于端平元年（1234年）六月，“禁毁铜钱作器用并贸易下海”\n，又于淳祐十年（1250年），“以会价低减，复申严下海之禁。”"],

古希腊哲学\n\n古希腊哲学亦称古希腊罗马哲学。公元前6世纪的希腊奴隶社会经济比较发达，在东方埃及和巴比伦的影响下，文化也得到了迅速的发展。西方哲学史在这里开始了它的第一个发展时期。古希腊哲学从神话传说中产生以后，首先集中于对宇宙本源的探讨，最早有米利都学派，以后有毕达哥拉斯和毕达哥拉斯学派、赫拉克利特、爱利亚学派和原子论者，一般称之为自然哲学。\n最初的自然哲学家和以前的宗教家不同，他们很重视对自然科学的研究，但思想还打上了宗教神话的烙印，把人和自然、思维与存在看成是浑然一体的东西，他们中有的主张“物活论”，认为万物都和人一样是活的、有生命的。\n米利都学派以物质性的“水”、“无限定”或“气”为本原，从质料和性质方面研究多样性事物的统一性。毕达哥拉斯学派以“数”为本原，从形式和量的方面研究多样性事物的统一性。他们的思想中暗含着一个如何用不变的东西来解释变的东西的问题。但是，他们还没有深究变与不变的关系问题。\n赫拉克利特和爱利亚学派正好从两个对立的方面发挥和发展了对这个问题的看法：赫拉克利特强调变的方面，认为只有变才是真实的，没有永久不变的东西。他关于对立统一和斗争的思想，标志着他是西方哲学史上辩证法的一个重要奠基人。相反，爱利亚学派则强调不变的方面，认为世界上只有“存在”，没有“不存在”，只有“一”才是真实的，“多”则是虚幻的，因而只有不变才是真实的。爱利亚学派的巴门尼德明确提出了思维与存在两个范畴，并首先提出“思维与存在是同一的”命题，对以后哲学的发展具有重大的意义。\n\n关于变与不变的关系问题，后来的自然哲学家认为，赫拉克利特与爱利亚学派都各有片面性，必须既承认变又承认不变，只是要对这两者作出新的解释。后期的自然哲学家恩培多克勒、阿那克萨戈拉和德谟克利特等就肩负着这样的任务。他们认为，不变的东西不是一个，如水或火；而是许多个，如恩培多克勒的“四元素”、阿那克萨戈拉的“种子”、德谟克利特的“原子”（见原子与虚空），变是这许多不变者的不同组合。\n后期自然哲学家认为万物的基础不变，可是又不否认变，这就产生了变的原动力从何而来的问题。他们中间有的人认为原动力来自不变者之外，如阿那克萨戈拉认为这种原动力是“奴斯”。这种思想使早期自然哲学家的“物活论”思想开始遭到破坏，在一定意义下，有分离思维与存在的因素。\n公元前5世纪，古希腊哲学的兴趣由研究自然转移到研究人，智者的主要代表普罗泰戈拉、高尔吉亚就是这样。在他们看来，自然哲学时期的各派学说都失之于独断。他们一般不相信有真正的存在和客观真理。普罗泰戈拉认为“衡量万物的尺度是人”，一切知识都同样的真，人所依从的准则就是自己，是非善恶都是相对于人的感觉而言，他们的思想是相对主义。高尔吉亚认为一切都同样的假，他的思想属于怀疑论。\n智者们对当时的一切知识产生怀疑，这样的怀疑主义激发了人类对习俗、道德、宗教、政治和社会制度的合理性的思考。\n苏格拉底和智者一样，也是集中研究人的哲学家，他同样轻视对自然的研究，反对未经批评的独断，他一生都致力于对智者学派学者的观点进行反驳但他与智者相反，主张有客观真理、认识事物是可能的。“至善就是知识”，他认为真正的知识就是从具体的道德行为中归纳引申出各种道德的普遍定义，而寻求定义的方法就是归纳演绎。他的论辩诘难的方法是辩证法的最早来源。欧几里得结合埃利亚学派实际存在是一个统一整体的论点和苏格拉底的知识等同于德性的论点创立了麦加学派；苏格拉底的伦理学构成了快乐学派和犬儒学派的基础。\n由于智者和苏格拉底着重于人的研究，古希腊哲学关于思维与存在的关系问题有了新的内容，关于认识的辩证法也得到了发展。\n公元前4世纪，古希腊哲学进入系统化时期，代表人物是柏拉图和亚里士多德。他们总结了以前各派的哲学思想，创立了自己的哲学体系。\n柏拉图的“理念论”是典型的客观唯心主义。他的“理念”主要来源于爱利亚学派的不变的本质、苏格拉底的普遍性定义以及毕达哥拉斯派的数的概念；他关于感官事物是运动变化的以及感官事物的真理只是相对的思想，主要来源于赫拉克利特和普罗泰戈拉。柏拉图综合了这两方面的思想，又赋予它们以新的意义。柏拉图认为理念在感官事物之外，普遍在个别之外，这就在本体论上分裂了思维与存在、普遍与个别的关系。\n亚里士多德的思想，主要来源于柏拉图的客观唯心主义，他既重视理念，又注重经验事实。亚里士多德把这两方面结合为一，创立了庞大的哲学体系。他批评柏拉图将理念看成是和个别事物分离的、独立存在的实体，认为理念或他所说的“形式”不能离开感官事物而存在，普遍不能离开个别而存在。亚里士多德要在理念和感官事物、普遍与个别之间建立起联系，认为这种联系的关键就是有目的的发展，发展是由潜能到现实的转化。亚里士多德的这个思想使辩证法特别是一与多的辩证关系在西方哲学史上第一次得到了系统化。但他关于“纯形式”与“纯质料”的学说（见形式和质料），却使他陷入了形而上学。\n从公元前322年亚里士多德死后约800年期间，希腊文化逐渐与罗马文化相结合。纯粹的希腊哲学渐成过去。\n这800年的前期，主要哲学流派有伊壁鸠鲁学派（见伊壁鸠鲁和伊壁鸠鲁学派）、斯多阿学派和以皮浪为代表的怀疑论。除伊壁鸠鲁继承和发展了德谟克利特的原子唯物论外，他们都集中于伦理问题的讨论。这个时期对于某些具体科学的兴趣也出自伦理行为的需要。伊壁鸠鲁学派和斯多阿学派的伦理思想以小苏格拉底学派为其前驱，怀疑论则源于智者的思想。三派关于伦理问题的争论导致马尔库斯·图留斯·西塞罗的折衷主义。大约从公元前 100年起，罗马哲学由对伦理的兴趣转向了宗教，新毕达哥拉派和新柏拉图学派都是带有浓厚宗教色彩的哲学，而以A.奥古斯丁为代表的“教父哲学”则更是一种十足的宗教哲学。在这个时期，最值得注意的是，罗马唯物主义者卢克莱修继承和发展了德谟克利特和伊壁鸠鲁的原子唯物论；新柏拉图派的波菲利和普罗提诺概括了普遍与个别、一与多的关系问题。\n古希腊是西方哲学史的诞生地，西方哲学史上各式各样的思想学说都可以在古希腊哲学中找到自己的起源。随着西方哲学史的发展，古希腊哲学所阐发的各种思想又都有了新的发展和新的特点。\n* 中世纪哲学\n\n在中世纪的封建社会时期，天主教会是最大的封建统治者，它支配了中世纪的世俗权力和精神生活，哲学不过是用理性解释信仰的工具，成了神学的婢女。中世纪的科学也和哲学一样屈服于宗教的支配。这时人们所注意的中心不是世俗生活而是脱离世俗的天国。中世纪的主要哲学问题是神与人、天国与世俗的关系问题。\n中世纪哲学主要是古希腊罗马哲学特别是柏拉图哲学、亚里士多德哲学和新柏拉图主义同基督教合流的产物，而在各个发展阶段中，这些成分所占的比重又各不相同。\n以奥古斯丁为代表的教父哲学在时间上属于古代，但就其思想意识形态来说，则属于中世纪，它是基督教哲学的最初形态。奥古斯丁运用新柏拉图主义论证基督教教义，确立了基督教哲学，他首先提出信仰第一，然后理解的原则，为中世纪经院哲学奠定了基础。奥古斯丁以后的中世纪哲学分为三个时期：\n一、早期中世纪哲学\n5—11世纪初是中世纪哲学的早期。这时，人们对于古代哲学除亚里士多德的逻辑学片断和新柏拉图主义外，所知不多。这个时期，新柏拉图主义比基督教的成分更占优势。主要代表人物是波爱修和爱留根纳。波爱修是连接古代哲学与中世纪哲学的桥梁，他对古代的波菲利关于普遍与个别的问题作了自己的回答。他重视多样的个别事物的真实性，是中世纪唯名论的先驱（见唯名论与实在论）。爱留根纳是一个披着基督教外衣的新柏拉图主义者。他主张“否定的神学”，与正统的基督教神学观相左。爱留根纳认为统一的普遍的整体是最真实的，反之，愈是多样性的东西则愈不全面因而也愈不真实。不过他认为多样性和最高统一体“上帝”之间有桥梁可通，这就是“理念”。爱留根纳的这种思想源于柏拉图哲学和新柏拉图主义，是中世纪实在论的先驱。\n二、中期中世纪哲学\n11—14世纪初，是中世纪哲学的中期，即经院哲学的全盛期。在此期间，基督教势力强大，经院哲学以基督教的思想为主导。同时，亚里士多德的哲学和著作经阿拉伯哲学家的介绍在西欧得到广泛传播。这样，经院哲学不仅有了柏拉图哲学和新柏拉图主义的因素，还增加了亚里士多德哲学的因素，而且后一种因素的影响在这一时期中逐渐增长。\n经院哲学的特征是奉基督教教义为无上权威，但要用理性去加以解释，解释的方法极其烦琐，成了一种纯粹抽象的逻辑推理。\n经院哲学集中于唯名论与实在论之争，这是由古希腊哲学中柏拉图与亚里士多德关于重普遍概念与重个别事物的思想分歧发展而来的。实在论以安瑟尔谟为代表，受柏拉图理念论的影响，主张只有普遍是真实的，普遍先于个别而独立存在；唯名论以罗瑟林为代表，受亚里士多德的以个别事物为第一实体的思想影响，主张只有个别的东西有实在性，个别先于普遍，普遍不过是名称。实在论认为，普遍的教会实在，而个别的教会是从属的；基督教的普遍教义是实在，而个别人的信仰是从属的；原罪是实在，而个别人的罪恶是从属的；天堂是实在，而世俗是影子，是从属的，等等。唯名论则相反。因此，正统的教会人士都崇奉实在论而轻视唯名论。12—13世纪，唯名论已不盛行，与唯名论有联系的柏拉图哲学也几乎成了异端，正统派的权威是实在论者、新柏拉图主义者。\n不过，由于新柏拉图主义者的泛神论思想与正统的基督教教义相抵触，教会早已视之为异端，加上到了13世纪，亚里士多德的著作大量从阿拉伯文以至希腊原文译成拉丁文，亚里士多德哲学的影响大为增长，教会遂转而利用亚里士多德哲学中与教义相结合的方面。于是被基督教教义改造过的亚里士多德哲学成了官方哲学。托马斯·阿奎那是这种官方哲学的最高权威。他明确主张哲学服务于神学，反对阿拉伯先进哲学家提出的“二重真理”说；他区分了理性和信仰，但又力图加以调和；他认为启示高于理性，哲学以理性解释上帝，不能与宗教信仰相矛盾。对于普遍与个别的问题，托马斯·阿奎那采取了温和的实在论立场。\n三、晚期中世纪哲学\n14—15世纪中，是中世纪哲学的末期。由于罗马教会的衰微、自然科学的发展，亚里士多德哲学中重经验事实的本来面目逐步被认识，人们厌弃教会曲解了亚里士多德，于是正统的经院哲学日趋没落，哲学日益脱离神学。在这个时期以前，12世纪的阿拉伯著名哲学家伊本·路西德已提出了反对正统经院哲学的思想。他崇敬亚里士多德，甚至具有比亚里士多德更多的唯物主义思想。他提倡“二重真理”说，否认真主干预世界，主张自然事物受因果必然性支配。13世纪，伊本·路西德的学说盛行，形成了所谓“阿威罗伊主义”的思潮，其最大代表是在巴黎大学任教的布拉邦的西格尔。此外，在这个时期中，唯名论和渊源于新柏拉图主义的神秘主义异端思想也重新盛行，个人自由的思想抬头。这个时期的唯名论代表人物是培根、司各特、奥康的威廉，神秘主义的代表人物是德国神学家埃克哈特（1260—1327）。\n* 近代哲学\n\n近代哲学是由封建主义到资本主义的过渡时期和自由资本主义时期的哲学。\n西欧封建社会的后期，一系列科学技术的发明和重大的地理发现，促进了资本主义生产方式的形成和发展，激发了社会内部的各种矛盾，加快了新旧思想交替的进程；同时，也由于中世纪哲学内部经院哲学脱离实际的烦琐的推演方法、理性与信仰的逐渐分离，等等，经院哲学便日趋崩溃，西方哲学史即由中世纪哲学转入了近代哲学。近代哲学分为三个时期：\n一、文艺复兴时期哲学\n由中世纪到近代的过渡期，即15—16世纪的所谓“文艺复兴”时期，是一个自我觉醒的时代。人们的思想从空幻的彼岸世界回到了现实的此岸，从清净的僧院走到了纷扰的尘世，从而发展了自然，也发现了人自身。追求科学知识，要求个性解放，反对宗教桎梏，这是当时人们的一般精神面貌。自然和人成了当时思想界所研究的中心课题。在这一研究的过程中，形成了人文主义和自然哲学两股互相联系而又有一定区别的思潮。\n人文主义主张以人为中心，一切为了人的利益。它研究古代文化和各种哲学流派，是以资产阶级人道主义为核心的反封建、反神学的新文化运动。人文主义的主要代表人物有柏拉图派的希腊人普莱索、贝沙里扬和意大利人M.费奇诺（1433—1499），亚里士多德派的彭波那齐等。\n自然哲学的代表人物主要有库萨的尼古拉、特莱西奥和布鲁诺。这些自然哲学家在15世纪下半叶兴起的近代自然科学的基础上，用自己的唯物主义反对经院哲学的唯心主义，用经验观察的科学方法反对经院哲学的推演方法，用辩证法的思想反对经院哲学的形而上学。不过，近代自然科学的发展还刚刚开始，对自然的研究往往与魔术、炼金术、占星术纠缠在一起，新科学尚未完全获得独立。\n值得注意的是，自然哲学家尼古拉和布鲁诺从认识论的角度探讨了如何把握对立统一的途径问题。尼古拉从当时自然科学的材料出发，在近代哲学史上第一个提出了对立面一致的原理。他把多样性的统一归结为对立面的统一，认为只有对立的统一才是最高的真理。他还明确主张，要把握对立面的一致，需要经过三个相辅相成的阶段，即“感性”、“知性”和“理性”的阶段。\n二、中期近代哲学\n17—18世纪末，是近代哲学的中期。这个时期，资本主义进一步发展，自然科学出现了分门别类的研究，现实世界成了可以由人类把握的对象，哲学的兴趣集中在主体与客体的关系，思维与存在的统一等问题上。真正的近代哲学也就是从这里开始的。\n自“文艺复兴”和宗教改革以后，近代自然科学日益脱离神学而繁荣昌盛。1600年前后的 100年左右，出现了哥白尼、开普勒、伽利略等许多科学上的伟人，17世纪是近代自然科学取得辉煌成就的世纪。这时，科学的标准不再是古代的柏拉图、亚里士多德学说或基督教的教义，而是自然本身；科学的方法也不再象过渡时期那样，掺杂很多神秘的巫术，而是以观察和实验为基础的归纳法和数学的演绎法。与此相适应，在哲学上，从前被认为是由神灵统治的世界，之后则被认为是由因果必然性支配的世界，形而上学的机械的宇宙观一时占了统治的地位，这种情况一直延续到18世纪下半叶康德的时代。\n近代科学的方法肇端于伽利略，他同时也为近代哲学提供了研究的方法。伽利略方法的特点是，以观察和实验为基础，进行归纳和数学的演绎。他与培根同时，都很重视归纳法，但培根轻视演绎法，而伽利略则将归纳法与演绎法同时并举。归纳法与数学演绎法的分歧，在哲学认识论上表现为经验论与唯理论之争。经验论认为哲学的研究方法只是以实验、观察为基础的归纳法，知识只限于感官经验中的东西。经验论者轻视或否认超经验的玄学问题。唯理论则依据数学演绎法，认为思维独立于感官经验，思维可以把握超经验的东西。唯理论者注重玄学问题的研究。经验论者和唯理论者从两个相反的角度去求得思维与存在的统一。经验论者重感觉中个别的东西，重多样性，其思想源于中世纪的唯名论；唯理论者重思想中普遍的概念，重统一性，其思想源于中世纪的实在论。经验论的代表人物是培根、霍布斯、洛克、乔治·贝克莱和大卫·休谟，唯理论的代表人物是笛卡尔、斯宾诺莎、莱布尼茨和沃尔夫。\n培根是近代唯物主义经验论的第一个代表，他把经验当做统一思维与存在的关键，在近代哲学史上第一个提出思维的主体“人”应该主动干扰自然，使之服务于人类。他为近代哲学中统一思维与存在的要求和思维趋势打下了一定的基础。他的“二重真理”说，在当时条件下起了打击神学的进步作用。\n笛卡尔是近代唯理论的第一个代表。他排斥一切外在权威，把人的思维当作哲学的开端。他的“天赋观念”说，主张单凭思维中的普遍性概念即可把握最高真理;他的怀疑一切的主张，就是清除成见，完全运用思维以达到客观真理。笛卡尔的这些思想实际上是把人的理性认识当作统一存在与思维的关键。他提出的“我思故我在”的所谓最可靠的原理，把思维和存在直接地统一起来。在本体论方面，笛卡尔是割裂思维与存在的二元论者，为了解释二者的结合问题，他抬出了上帝，认为在上帝那里，思维与存在是统一的。他也是一个机械论者，认为动物不过是一架机器。\n斯宾诺莎是唯物主义者和唯理论者。他的认识论、几何学的方法以及机械的自然观都直接来源于笛卡尔。他关于思维与存在不过是唯一实体的两种属性的学说，是对笛卡尔二元论的批评和发展。他认为多样性的个别事物不过是唯一实体的变形，只有实体有独立自存性，个别事物只有通过唯一实体才能得到认识和说明。\n洛克发展了唯物主义的经验论，他尖锐地驳斥了笛卡尔唯心主义的“天赋观念”说，提出了自己的白板说，不过他也强调人们能从感觉经验中抽象出普遍性的概念。洛克是温和的唯名论者，认为感觉中的个别东西是第一位的。洛克还保留了笛卡尔割裂思维与存在的二元论的思想因素。\n莱布尼茨是唯心主义的唯理论者，他站在笛卡尔的立场上，针锋相对地反对洛克的唯物主义的经验论。他说洛克的体系和亚里士多德关系密切，他自己的体系和柏拉图接近。他也重视普遍性概念，是“天赋观念”说的拥护者，不过与笛卡尔略有区别。在本体论方面，他表述了普遍与个别、统一性和多样性的关系的看法，认为万物的实体是“单子”，“单子”虽然彼此不能相互作用，但由于“前定和谐”而联系在一个统一体即神之中。“前定和谐”说是对笛卡尔的二元论和斯宾诺莎的身心平行论的继承和发展。这里虽然包含着一和多对立统一的辩证思想，但这种统一的原则处于多样性的“单子”之外，和斯宾诺莎的普遍性、统一性与个别性、多样性的原则很不相同。\n巴克莱是唯心主义的经验论者。他从洛克哲学所包含的二元论和不可知论走向了主观唯心主义。他提出\"存在就是被感知\",认为世界上除了感知的主体即精神实体和被感知的知觉“观念”之外，什么也没有。他为了反对唯物主义和无神论，极力攻击普遍性的抽象概念特别是关于物质的抽象概念。他主张极端的唯名论，不同意洛克的“概念论”，认为抽象概念既无客观实在性，也不能存在于人心中。\n休谟也是唯心主义的经验论者。他比巴克莱走得更远，不但在实际上取消了物质实体，而且根据巴克莱提出的同样理由，取消了精神实体。他认为真实存在的只有知觉，经验由知觉构成，知觉以外的东西都是不可知的，因此，一切玄学问题都不可能成立。休谟以自己的不可知论和怀疑论完全否定了统一性和普遍性的东西，把多样性和个别性当成了最高原则。这样，17—18世纪英国哲学中重个别性的原则，就由洛克的“概念论”经巴克莱的极端唯名论到休谟的怀疑论和不可知论而发展到了顶峰。\n17—18世纪的经验论与唯理论的争论包含了唯物主义与唯心主义、无神论与宗教的斗争，但只是到18世纪的法国哲学，才出现公开的唯物主义与无神论。拉美特里公开宣布，唯物主义是唯一的真理；狄德罗还拒绝承认上帝的存在。18世纪法国哲学不是一些纯理论性的东西，而是同政治伦理思想紧密结合在一起的。18世纪法国哲学的主要代表人物有伏尔泰、孟德斯鸠、卢梭和百科全书派的唯物主义哲学家拉美特利、爱尔维修、狄德罗、霍尔巴赫。百科全书派的唯物主义是当时法国哲学的最高成就，是马克思主义以前机械唯物主义的最完善的形式。其思想来源，一是笛卡尔的唯物主义思想成分，一是洛克的唯物主义的经验论。法国唯物主义者明确主张只有物质实体，认为思维不过是物质的属性，这在解决思维与存在的统一性问题上比过去大大前进了一步。他们都取消了洛克的“内省”经验，认为经验的唯一来源是感觉，他们一般是唯物主义的感觉论者。他们用因果必然性解释一切，完全排斥偶然性，把运动归结为机械运动，认为“人也不过是一架机器”。\n三、德国古典哲学\n自18世纪末的康德哲学起，近代哲学进入了它的晚期。\n18世纪末法国大革命时代的历史辩证法和18世纪末到19世纪上半叶自然科学的成就，促使西方近代哲学发展到了自己的最高阶段。上一个时期盛行的伽利略的数学方法和牛顿的形而上学方法被进化发展的观点所取代。这个时期的德国唯心主义哲学家们在不同程度上，以不同方式，运用辩证法总结前人的思想，特别是总结唯理论与经验论之争，创立了以康德、黑格尔为主要代表的德国古典唯心主义。\n自“文艺复兴”以后，人权问题固然从神权束缚下解放了出来，但17—18世纪形而上学的、机械论的宇宙观，又把人们的精神束缚于自然界因果必然性之下，个人的自由意志被抹杀了，存在与思维没有得到统一。康德、费希特、谢林、黑格尔置身学院，在抽象的哲学范围内，站在唯心主义立场上，再一次为维护人类精神的独立自主而斗争。他们给哲学规定的任务是，在思维第一性的基础上，力求使存在与思维统一起来。他们一致认为，世界的本质是精神性的，精神、自我、主体在他们的哲学中都占中心地位，所不同者只是这种精神性的东西被把握的程度如何以及如何加以规定和说明。他们都承认哲学所追求的最高真理是多样性的统一或对立面的统一，统一性更根本，所不同者只是这种最高统一体能否由思想认识来把握以及对这种统一体作如何理解。他们都认为唯理论与经验论各有片面性，企图在肯定思想概念更根本的基础上把感性认识和理性认识结合起来，所不同者只是结合的方式与程度不同。\n康德首先面临的问题是认识论的问题。他继承和发展了西方哲学史上关于认识过程的三分法，用“感性”、“知性”、“理性”三个环节构成了他的整个认识论体系。他结合休谟和莱布尼茨—沃尔夫学派的思想，主张知识既要有感觉经验的内容，又要有普遍性、必然性的形式。他认为，作为感觉经验外部来源的“物自体”是不可认识的，对知识起主导作用的是作为人类普遍意识的“自我”的“综合作用”。“自我”靠自己的“综合作用”把多样性的东西统一于普遍性、必然性之下，从而构成科学知识。就康德极力说明思维中普遍性、必然性的客观意义而言，他是企图在现象界内使思维与存在统一起来。但他认为，人心的综合决不满足于此种统一，人心还具有比“知性”更高的“理性”阶段，“理性”要求超出有条件的知识、经验的范围之外，以达到无条件的最高统一体即理念。\n康德认为，“知性”的概念范畴总是非此即彼的，只能应用于多样性的事物，若用它们去规定超经验的最高统一体──世界整体，则必然出现“二律背反”。康德这套思想对破除莱布尼茨—沃尔夫学派旧玄学的非此即彼的形而上学方法，是一个很大的贡献，它促使黑格尔达到了具体真理是亦此亦彼、对立统一的结论。\n费希特原来主张斯宾诺莎的机械的因果决定论，后来受康德的影响，认识到因果必然性只是现象，自我不是必然性的奴仆而是独立自由的主体。他为了更彻底地伸张人的独立自主性，便站在主观唯心主义的立场，打破康德的二元论，取消了康德的物自体，认为世界上的一切皆“自我”所创造。“自我”不是个人的我，而是普遍的我，是道德的自由的我。“自我”、“非我”二者的统一（见自我与非我），是一切事物进展的历程。世界上的一切事物不是按因果必然性联系起来的，而是趋向于道德自我，为完成道德自我的目的而存在。由此，费希特建立了主观唯心主义的思维（自我）与存在（非我）统一说。\n谢林从费希特哲学出发，又深受斯宾诺莎哲学和当时文学上浪漫派的思想影响，创立了自己的同一哲学，把费希特的主观唯心主义推向客观唯心主义。谢林不同意费希特把自然（非我）看作自我的产物。他认为自然和精神、存在和思维、客体和主体，表面相反，实则同一，都是同一个“绝对”的发展过程中的不同阶段。“绝对”是浑然一体的“无差别的同一”，是万事万物的根源。谢林继承了费希特变化发展的观点，认为整个世界的发展过程是正、反双方对立统一的过程，他还用目的论的发展观代替17—18世纪的机械观。不过，谢林认为自我意识发展的最高阶段是艺术，而不是费希特所说的道德，只有艺术的直观或称理智的直观，才能把握活生生的、精神性的“绝对同一”。\n黑格尔是集德国唯心主义之大成的哲学家。他创立了西方哲学史上最庞大的客观唯心主义体系，第一个系统地、自觉地阐述了辩证法的一般运动形式，成为马克思主义以前辩证法高级形态的最大代表。\n黑格尔认为，多样性的东西，彼此分离对立的东西，都不是最真实的，只有普遍性、统一性才是最真实的。不过，这种普遍不是脱离特殊的抽象普遍，而是包含特殊在内的普遍，叫做具体普遍或个体；这种统一不是脱离矛盾、对立的抽象统一，而是包含它们在内的统一，叫做对立统一或具体同一。具体普遍、对立统一是黑格尔全部辩证法的核心。另一方面，黑格尔作为一个客观唯心主义者，又认为只有精神性的东西才具有普遍性、统一性，单纯物质性的东西不可能有普遍性、统一性，因而也没有真实的存在。脱离精神无真实性和脱离统一无真实性，这两条原则是紧密结合在一起的，所以，最真实的无所不包的整体既是“绝对精神”，又是对立的统一。\n黑格尔继承和发展了前人特别是费希特、谢林的正反合的思想，把“绝对精神”这一最高统一体展开为逻辑、自然、精神三大阶段，也就是从思维到存在又到二者统一的过程，从而完成了唯心主义的思维与存在同一说。在他看来，逻辑理念不脱离自然和人类精神，思维不脱离存在，但逻辑理念是自然和人类精神的灵魂和根本，思维是存在的灵魂和根本，而自然则不过是逻辑理念的外部表现。至于人类精神乃是自然发展中所预想的目标的完成，是逻辑理念与自然的对立统一，又是最具体的、最现实的，也是最高的阶段。因而，关于人类精神的学问是最高的学问。精神的特点是自由，在这里，思维与存在、主体与客体统一，没有异己的东西限制自己。整个自然界的发展就是趋向于这种统一和自由的过程，这就是人类精神出于自然而又高于自然之所在。不过他根据具体同一体的思想，认为自由必须与必然相结合，个人必须与社会整体相结合。\n关于人类精神是否能把握以及如何把握最高统一体的问题，黑格尔既不同意康德的不可知论，也不同意谢林等神秘主义者所谓凭直观就可以一蹴而就地把握的观点。他认为最高统一体可以凭思维加以认识，而且必须经过漫长曲折的道路。他把这条道路不仅分为“感性”、“知性”、“理性”三阶段，而且又把它们细分为一些较小的阶段。黑格尔在唯心主义基础上第一次把人类从感性认识到理性认识的辩证法作了系统的、详细的阐述。\n德国古典哲学的最后一个代表是唯物主义哲学家费尔巴哈。他机智地驳斥了康德割裂思维与存在的二元论和不可知论，生动地讽刺了黑格尔所谓逻辑理念“外化”为自然的学说，指出了黑格尔的客体或存在的非物质性及虚假性。他还批判了黑格尔的唯心主义的思维与存在同一说，进而分析了黑格尔的唯心主义和一般唯心主义的根源。他认为，自然界是唯一实在的；人是自然的产物，是肉体与灵魂的统一；自然、现实是可以被人认识的，思维从存在而来，思维可以达到存在。费尔巴哈以灵魂与肉体相统一的人为出发点，建立了形而上学形态的“人本学”唯物主义和以这种唯物主义为基础的思维与存在同一说，从而把人们的注意力从黑格尔等唯心主义者所喧嚷的抽象自我或“绝对精神”中，转移到了有血有肉的人和现实世界。而且，他不再把人看成是一架机器。这就是他比18世纪法国唯物主义者的高明之处。不过费尔巴哈和黑格尔等人一样，也离开了人们的物质生产活动和人们之间的物质生产关系来谈人，这样的人仍然是抽象的。\n* 现代哲学\n\n从19世纪40年代起，西方哲学史进入了现代哲学的发展时期。\n随着19世纪上半期欧洲工业革命的完成，许多国家的社会经济状况进到了资本主义高度发展的阶段。这时，资本主义固有的矛盾也日益暴露，特别是无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾日益尖锐。资本主义大工业生产促进了自然科学的发展。细胞学说、能量守恒和转化定律、生物进化思想等的提出，极大地推进了人们的认识发展进程。\n面对社会的各种矛盾和自然界新的现象以及科学上的新发现，人们迫切需要理论的解释和哲学的概括。到了19世纪40年代，黑格尔学派已经解体，德国古典哲学已失去了它原有的光彩。但是，这一古典哲学仍然被后来的哲学家们所继承、利用、改造和发展。\n19世纪30—60年代形成了以赫尔岑、车尔尼雪夫斯基为主要代表的俄国革命民主主义者的哲学。马克思和恩格斯批判地吸取了黑格尔哲学的合理内核和费尔巴哈哲学的基本内核，在以往哲学成果的基础上实现了哲学史上的伟大变革，创立了辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。19世纪40年代和后半叶，是马克思主义哲学的形成以及它在欧洲的传播和发展时期。\n20世纪，马克思主义哲学在世界各国得到了广泛的传播和迅速的发展（见马克思主义哲学史）。在马克思主义哲学形成和发展的同时，西方资本主义国家也逐渐产生了其他的哲学派别，如实证主义、唯意志论、存在主义、结构主义等等，这些哲学流派总称为“现代西方哲学”。这是西方哲学史中现代哲学发展的另一个侧面。\n\n## 问题特点\n\n* 与科学、宗教的关系\n\n西方哲学史是哲学与科学息息相关、与宗教相互渗透而又相互对立的历史。\n在哲学产生以前，人们通过宗教信仰和神话，以形象化的形式表达自己的世界观。哲学的诞生意味着人们开始通过抽象的思维，用概念的形式表达自己的世界观。\n古希腊哲学是在摆脱宗教信仰和神话束缚的过程中诞生的，它从一开始便与科学结成了不可分离的关系，哲学家同时也是科学家。当时，人们只是从总的方面观察自然界，而没有对自然界进行解剖和分析，自然科学的这种情况反映在哲学上，就使古希腊哲学具有朴素辩证法的性质。\n古希腊哲学虽然从主要方面摆脱了宗教信仰和神话的束缚，但也有渗透神话的因素，古希腊哲学中流行的“物活论”思想便是这种渗透的表现；毕达哥拉学派相信灵魂轮回，就受了奥尔弗斯教义的影响。苏格拉底也曾明确宣称自己为神所引导。柏拉图分裂理念世界与感性世界的思想，则是奥尔弗斯教徒关于灵魂来源于天，肉体来源于地的教义的哲学表述，他的许多重要哲学思想也往往不是用纯粹的思想、概念而是用神话的方式来表达的。亚里士多德的一个重要哲学思想就是把神看作是一切活动的目的因。斯多阿学派把德行生活看成是灵魂与上帝的关系，甚至原子唯物主义者伊壁鸠鲁在强调神同自然和人没有任何联系的同时，仍在世界与世界的\"空隙\"中为神留下了一块地盘。到了古代哲学的后期，新毕达哥拉派和新柏拉图派更是带有浓厚的宗教色彩，他们的哲学后来被基督教所利用。\n随着基督教的兴起和封建统治者对基督教教会的利用，西方哲学便又溶化于宗教之中。中世纪哲学几乎完全受基督教教会的支配，科学也遭受同样的命运。如果说，在古希腊时期，特别是它的早期，哲学与科学尚未明确区分开来，那么在中世纪，哲学则是与宗教神学合为一体。中世纪在哲学上的最大争论是实在论与唯名论之争，这同宗教上关于普遍教会与地方教会、普遍教义与个人信仰、原罪与个人罪恶何者实在何者从属之争，是相互渗透在一起的。在这种渗透中，哲学从属于宗教。\n不过，中世纪占主导地位的经院哲学并非根本否认理性和思维的作用，它主要是运用形式逻辑的方法，从外在的权威即教会所解释的圣经出发，演绎、推论出事实。它在为宗教服务的同时，也曾在一定限度内起了维护理性和思维的作用，为后来文艺复兴时期科学的发展提供了条件。\n* 西方近代哲学在与科学的关系方面表现了自身的特点，这一时期哲学与自然科学的关系不同于古希腊，它们之间有了明确的分工。哲学思想主要地是通过更加抽象的、专门的哲学概念来表述。不过近代哲学与科学之间仍然保持着紧密的联系，近代哲学发展的阶段性是与近代科学发展的阶段性相适应的。17—18世纪，自然科学进入了对自然界进行分门别类的研究和对各种事物进行分析解剖的阶段，它所采用的方法主要是以实验和观察为基础的归纳法和数学演绎法。与自然科学的这种状况相适应，17—18世纪形而上学思维方式在哲学中占主导地位。康德的星云假说打开了形而上学思维的第一个缺口。18世纪末19世纪初自然科学中的新发现和新成就表明，自然界的现象是辩证地发生的。自然科学的这种状况反映在哲学上，便是从康德到黑格尔的德国古典唯心主义哲学的辩证法形态。从古希腊的素朴辩证法形态，经过17—18世纪形而上学思维方式的阶段，到德国古典唯心主义辩证法的形态，这一哲学上的否定之否定的过程，是和整个西方自然科学发展的过程相并行的。正因为近代哲学与科学有极其密切的联系，哲学对科学的方法作了概括，接受了科学方法的洗礼，近代哲学一般地说也很强调方法，既讲究形式逻辑，又联系科学所提供的事实，表现了重分析、重体系、重论证与论据等特点。\n* 思维与存在的关系\n\n这是一切哲学的基本问题，但在西方哲学史及其各个发展时期中却有独特的、不同的表现形式。西方哲学史是从思维与存在浑然一体观，经过把两者看成分离对立的观点，逐步走向形而上学唯物主义或客观唯心主义的思维与存在对立统一观点的发展史。\n古希腊哲学是素朴的，尚未注意到思维与存在的对立。巴门尼德第一次提出了“思维与存在是同一的”命题。其他哲学家中流行的“物活论”观点，也没有把思维与存在区分开来。柏拉图的“理念论”把理念世界和感性世界对立起来，破坏了“物活论”，在一定意义下分离了思维与存在。但他所讲的这两个世界都是人以外的外部世界，他把理念世界理解为外部世界中的普遍性和统一性的方面，把感性世界理解为其中的个别性和多样性的方面,却没有把它们理解为以人的主体为一方，外部世界为另一方的主客关系。柏拉图和极大多数古希腊哲学家一样，他们所探讨的哲学问题，从主要方面说，是本体论的问题。古希腊哲学家还没有把人作为一个与客体相对立、相联系的具有主观能动性、独立自主性的主体来研究，而是静观世界。比较特殊的是智者，他们从本体论的研究转向人的研究。“人是万物的尺度”这一著名命题，是近代人本主义思想的最早来源。在他们看来，人只能认识现象，现象就是一切。他们还没有提出现象背后的彼岸世界问题。智者作为古希腊哲学家，其思想同样具有素朴的性质，他们还没有象近代哲学那样把主体与客体对立起来的思想，也不知道近代哲学意义下的思维与存在的对立。\n思维与存在的关系在中世纪主要表现为人的灵魂与肉体、精神方面与自然方面、宗教生活与世俗生活的分裂和对立。人的灵魂和精神在天国和宗教生活中与神合一，构成思维的一方；反之，人的肉体和自然方面以及外部世界则构成存在的一方，与神处于对立的地位。神的统治不仅把尘世看作应被克服的障碍，而且也窒息了人的精神和主体性。在这个意义说，中世纪哲学的主要问题是神与人的关系问题。\n思维与存在的关系问题，只是在欧洲人从中世纪的长期冬眠中觉醒以后才获得它完全的意义。近代哲学的一条根本原则是把思维着的人，逐步深入地理解为具有主观能动性、独立自主性的主体。近代哲学意义下的思维与存在的关系就是这样的主体与客体的关系。正是在这种意义下，近代哲学便突出了认识论的问题，突出了唯物主义与唯心主义之争。如果说在古代哲学中，人对外部世界的态度是静观的；在中世纪哲学中，人对外部世界的态度是避世的；那么，在近代哲学中，人对外部世界的态度的基本倾向则是能动的。\n近代哲学对人的能动性的态度也有一个发展过程：文艺复兴时期的哲学把人权从神权的束缚下解放出来，在一定程度上发展了人的能动性；但18世纪的哲学又把人看成是机器，使人完全受制于自然界的因果必然性；只是到了18世纪末19世纪初，在德国古典唯心主义哲学那里，人的能动性才再一次得到解放。\n近代哲学家们不仅认识到思维与存在即主体与客体的对立，而且还力求克服这种对立，并使之达到统一。F.培根曾公开主张人应主动征服自然，使自然服务于人类。唯理论者企图以人的理性认识作为统一思维与存在的桥梁。经验论者企图通过人的感性认识达到思维与存在的统一。他们把感性认识与理性认识分割开来，所讲的统一仍然是形而上学的统一。康德区分现象界与物自体，割裂了思维与存在，但他只是认为物自体不能凭知性范畴、凭认识去把握，却可以凭信仰去把握，特别是他强调自我在认识中的能动作用，在他所谓的现象界达到了唯心主义的思维与存在的统一。黑格尔在客观唯心主义基础上建立了思维与存在的辩证统一；费尔巴哈建立了人本学唯物主义的思维与存在的统一。在近代哲学中，他们对思维与存在关系的认识达到了马克思主义哲学以前的最高峰。\n* 一与多的关系\n\n西方哲学史是对一与多，包括普遍与个别、统一性与多样性、不变与变之间关系认识的发展史。一与多的关系问题在西方哲学史上是辩证法与形而上学思想方法相互斗争的中心问题。这一问题的讨论，从本体论角度发展到认识论角度，逐渐克服了将二者割裂的形而上学，走向了将二者统一起来的辩证观点。\n古希腊哲学关于本原究竟是水还是气或者是火等等的讨论，实际上都是要在个别的、多样的、变动不居的东西中寻找普遍的、统一性的、不变的东西。柏拉图的“理念论”所说的感性事物就是指个别的、多样性的、变动不居的东西，理念就是指这些东西的型式，即普遍的、统一的、不变的东西。他把二者割裂开来，认为后者在前者之外，先于前者而存在，他是重普遍轻个别的哲学家。亚里士多德批评了柏拉图的“理念说”，他比较重视个别，认为理念不在感性事物之外，而在感性事物之中，普遍不在个别之外，而在个别之中。但他在这个问题上也时常陷入混乱和困境。\n古希腊哲学家主要是从本体论的角度讨论普遍与个别的关系问题。新柏拉图主义者波菲利曾从本体论的角度把古希腊关于这个问题的各种讨论加以概括而提出 3个问题：\n①有没有普遍的实体？\n②如果有，它是有形体的还是没有形体的？\n③普遍的实体是在个别的东西之中还是在它们之外？\n中世纪早期哲学家波爱修第一个正面回答了波菲利的问题。中世纪的实在论与唯名论之争，可以说是重普遍与重个别之争。不过中世纪哲学是既从本体论的角度也从认识论的角度讨论这个问题的，这两派各有片面性，他们从不同方面把普遍与个别作了形而上学的割裂。\n近代哲学着重从认识的角度讨论了一与多关系问题，总的趋势是要求把二者结合起来。近代哲学中的唯理论与经验论之争包含有一与多关系问题的讨论。经验论者重多，洛克以个别为实在，巴克莱和休谟是极端重视个别、否认普遍的哲学家；唯理论者重一，其中斯宾诺莎尤其突出，他只崇尚唯一的实体，把多样性的事物看成是唯一实体的变形，把实体看成是铁板一块的东西。康德看到唯理论与经验论各有片面性，企图结合普遍与个别而构成科学知识，但他并没有把两者有机地结合起来。他的理念是理性所追求的无限统一体，但他割裂了无限和有限，使最高统一体脱离了有限的多样性事物。只有黑格尔才在唯心主义基础上系统地阐发了一与多的辩证关系，他不但达到了多样性的统一，还达到了对立面的统一。黑格尔对一与多关系的论述，达到了近代哲学史上的最高水平。",

西方哲学史\n西方哲学的历史通常分为三大时期：古代、中世纪、和近代。古代时期到罗马的陷落为止，包括希腊哲学家比如柏拉图。中世纪大致到十五世纪晚期和文艺复兴为止。近代大约指从十六世纪晚期至十九世纪早期。当代哲学包括自十九世纪后半叶、二十世纪以来的哲学。\n##古代哲学\n西方哲学一般被认为始于米利都的泰勒斯，他活跃于公元前585年左右，并提出了“水是万物之源”这个命题。这个命题的重要性不在于它的正确与否而是它提出了这样一个问题：万物是由什么构成的？他最著名的学生有阿那克西曼德和阿那克西美尼。\n之后几个世纪中出现了其它的思想家及其学派，其中最重要的有：\n这段时期的哲学发展最后聚集到古希腊最大的城市：雅典。有大量关于雅典文化是如何激励了哲学的发展的探讨，其中一种流行的理论认为主要原因是雅典拥有直接民主。在柏拉图的著作中人们发现以诡辩和争论为基础的智者学派地位很高，他们的授课保证了良好的收入来源。另一个证据是雄辩家对雅典史具有极大的影响，甚至导致了雅典文化的失败。另外一种理论认为哲学探讨在雅典的流行是由于当时的奴隶制度。由于劳动力主要由奴隶构成，这样自由民和贵族们就能从劳作和生产活动中解放出来。他们有闲暇自由地去参与雅典广场上的集会，花费大量时间用于辩论那些流行的哲学问题。为了影响雅典集会从而获得地位和财富，人们开始学习钻研雄辩的技术。由于赢得辩论的种种好处，辩论的主题和方法获得了极大的发展。不幸的是，这种发展最终导致了诡辩术的流行，结果导致雅典的沦陷。\n将古希腊哲学转变为一门统一、持续的学科的关键人物是苏格拉底。他曾在一些智者门下学习，之后他生命中的绝大部分时间都用于和雅典城中每一个人谈话，和他们讨论各式各样的问题，尤其是道德问题，例如公正和真理。但他一点也不关心物理世界，因为他觉得从树木和石头那里学不到什么。他没有著述，但激励了众多门徒，他在晚年时候遭到人们的敌视，尽管他的人格受人尊敬。他在道德问题上的诡辩和哲学思考使人们相信他对神明不敬，败坏雅典青年的品行。公元前399年被法律判决处死。\n苏格拉底最著名的学生是柏拉图，他用他老师研究问题的方法写下了一系列哲学对话。他早期的对话录中仍带有苏格拉底的不确定性风格，后来发展出他独立的形而上学和伦理学体系去解决问题，这时他的核心思想是理念论，晚期他更关注于直接的伦理问题。在他最著名的作品《理想国》中，他攻击民主体制，认为这是导致伯罗奔尼撒战争败北的主要原因。他建立了雅典的学院，培养了大量的思想家，其中包括他最著名的学生亚里士多德。亚里士多德最有影响力的学说是他的形而上学和逻辑学，他也是第一个描述了三段论的哲学家。\n##中世纪哲学\n中世纪哲学一般称为经院哲学，其目的是为了调和宗教与哲学，一般认为它始于圣·奥古斯丁。柏拉图的哲学在这一时期获得了卓越的地位，而亚里士多德被认定为异端。12世纪的阿奎那致力于利用亚里士多德的哲学服务基督教，但对亚里士多德的研究没有促进哲学思想的发展，却使他学说中很多物理学上的谬误变得根深蒂固。由于宗教获得了统治地位，所以哲学主要研究上帝的本性，关于上帝的存在性论证成了当时最受关注的问题。\n阿奎那的哲学体系试图通过宇宙的合理性来论证上帝的存在。他的论据是由于所有事物的存在都有它的原因，那么就必须有一个最原初的、不受任何其它事物所影响的原因，而这个最初的原因就是上帝。他用这一论据进而论证上帝的神性，所有的事物都有其神性，而每一个事物的原因必然具有更高的神性，所以最原初的动因，也就是上帝具有最高的神性。相类似地，他以此证明上帝的力量与独特。\n另一个本体论上的关于上帝存在的论据是由安瑟伦提出的。他认为从根本上来说上帝拥有所有可能的善，既然存在本身就是一种善，那么上帝就拥有这一特性，所以上帝存在。这一论据以不同的方式被从笛卡尔开始之后的哲学家所引用。\n中世纪的其他重要哲学家有彼得·阿伯拉和邓斯·司各脱。由于宗教改革和文艺复兴，经院哲学遭到严峻的挑战并最终衰落下来。\n##近代哲学\n在文艺复兴的后期，对宗教的怀疑和批判声日益频繁，关注现实、运用理性的作品已经开始涌现。近代哲学的主要特征是反对专制、集权，要求思想的解放，反对控制，要求自由。这种思潮影响了之后几个世纪，一般近代哲学的划分到黑格尔或19世纪上半叶为止。\n这个时期的哲学可以以伊拉斯谟、马基雅维利、培根、伽利略等人为代表的人文主义和经验主义取代传统的经院哲学为最早的开端。17世纪哲学要求人们基于理性、怀疑、逻辑、公理之上进行哲学的重建，这些理念在笛卡尔、帕斯卡、霍布斯的著作中得到了最大程度的反映。人们开始将宗教信仰融合到各自的哲学体系之中，通过融合物质观点的二元论，来迎接无神论和其它信仰的挑战，贝克莱和斯宾诺莎则从不同方面扩展了神是唯一本质的一元论。\n17世纪后期至18世纪的启蒙时代诞生了许多伟大的思想家，如洛克、伏尔泰、狄德罗、卢梭。以牛顿为代表的自然哲学，孟德斯鸠等为代表的政治哲学，斯密为代表的经济学等各种思潮流行开来，最后到康德画上启蒙运动的句号。\n通过笛卡尔对知识如何可能的追问，认识论从17世纪开始一直是哲学的主要问题之一。对这个问题的不同回答发展出以英国经验主义和欧洲大陆唯理主义两条不同的路线。康德对休谟怀疑主义的批判发展出之后由费希特、谢林所发展，归结于黑格尔的德国唯心主义。\n##当代哲学\n从19世纪哲学开始，哲学就面对着众多领域的挑战。新的社会、政治、经济、科学、逻辑问题的产生，传统的关于知识基础、确定性的丧失等多方面的冲突使哲学走向多元化，要求对过去的知识体系从各个方面进行修正。当代哲学的先驱者有叔本华、克尔凯郭尔、弗洛伊德、尼采、马赫、杜威等等。以罗素、维特根斯坦为代表的分析哲学；以胡塞尔的现象学为基础，萨特、海德格尔为代表的存在主义；以福柯、德里达为代表的后现代主义等等成为当代哲学的主要流派。",

内容简介\n\n哲学史旨在有联系地阐述那为解决存在问题或使人了解我们的经验世界而作的各种尝试。它是从古至今探源究理的人类思想的发展史；不仅按年代列举和解释各种哲学理论，而且研究各种哲学理论彼此的关系、产生的时期，以及提供哲学理论的思想家。每一种思想体系或多或少地有赖于其所由兴起的文明、以前各种思想体系的性质，及其创始者的个性；它又反过来对当代和后代的思想和制度发生很大的影响。所以哲学史必须力求把每一种宇宙观放在它适当的背景中，把它看作是一个有机整体的一部分，把它同它过去、现在和将来的文化的、政治的、道德的、社会的和宗教的因素联系起来。哲学史又必须试图追踪人类思辨历史上往前推进的线索：说明称为哲学的思想观点怎样产生，各种问题和提供的解答怎样引起新的问题和答案，各个时代对于达到最后的解决有哪些进展。\n哲学史在很大程度上是对哲学最好的评论者；某一体系由它的后继者所继承、演变、发挥或推翻，这就会暴露其中的错误和矛盾；这种体系又往往是新的思想倾向的起点。哲学史家在自己的研究中应当采取不偏不倚和客观的态度，并且尽可能避免在探讨中渗入自己的哲学理论。但是完全消除个人因素是不可能的，哲学史家先人为主的成见必然在一定程度上流露于他的著作中。其表现方式多种多样：重视某些哲学，表明什么是进步和衰退，甚至对各个思想家论述的篇幅也有所不同。所有这些都是无可避免的。不过，应当让每个哲学家有机会充分地表明自己的论点，而不要常常加以批驳，使他受到干扰。而且我们不能单从现在的成就方面着眼来批评一个体系，就是说，不能用今天的标准来衡量而贬低它。同近代理论相比较，古希腊的世界观似乎是朴素、幼稚和粗糙的，而嘲讽这种世界观却极不明智。从当时的观点来看，人类最初努力了解世界而形成的这种世界观，显然是划时代的事件。评价一种思想体系，必须着眼于它本身的目的和历史背景，着眼于同它直接的前身和后继的体系相比较，着眼于它的前因后果以及由它所引起的发展。因此，我们的研究方法是历史的和批判的。\n\n##

文物介绍\n\n太平通宝方孔钱币，中国历代王朝多有铸造。以其用途，可以分为行用钱和厌胜钱（俗称花钱）两类。太平通宝为宋朝第一种对钱，南唐有篆书开元视为中国历史上第一种对钱。\n北宋太宗太平兴国年间，南宋高宗朝前后，南宋高宗建炎年间李婆备起义军，辽圣宗太平年间，明孝宗弘治年间大理国，清代天地会和小刀会起义军，等，均铸有太平通宝。\n安南（今越南）、日本等国，历史上也铸有太平通宝。安南顺化太祖阮璜，公元1627年铸太平通宝；日本镰仓时代（1192-1338年），民间亦私铸有太平通宝。\n北宋太宗赵光义，太平兴国年间（公元976～公元984）铸，为宋代第一种年号钱。太平兴国（976年十二月—984年十一月）是北宋君主宋太宗赵匡义的一个年号，共计近8年。吴越忠懿王钱俶亦用该年号纪年（976年十二月-978年五月）。\n隶书太平通宝，存世量巨，钱文大气磅礴，古拙雄强，雄浑而飘逸，传为太宗御书，钱径25mm，穿径6mm，廓厚1mm，重4克左右。\n篆书太平通宝，1995年5月出土于山东省济南市小清河北部地区，古篆书体，直读，光背，铜质，钱径25mm，穿径6mm，廓厚1mm，重4.3克。\n从钱币形制、钱文风格、铸钱工艺以及钱币的共通时代气息判断，篆书太平通宝，可以断定是宋太宗太平兴国年间铸行。与太平通宝隶书钱币，形成宋代的第一种对钱。只是因为太平兴国时期，为太宗的第一个年号，时间不足八年，其时太宗刚刚登基，政、战事忙乱，内稳帝位，安抚人心，外迫吴越纳土，平北汉、征辽国，试图统一交趾（今越南），执行守内虚外的政策。因此，铸行的太平通宝钱币，隶书钱币推行开来，得以流通全国；篆书钱币试铸后，因为时机不成熟或某种意外变故，却未能铸行天下。\n太平通宝篆书小平钱的发现和肯定，聊补宋代钱币史缺，与隶书太平通宝一同，可以确定为中国货币史重要时期的纲要钱。开宋代以后中国铸币年号钱、对书钱和御书钱之先河，并形成传统、制度，绵延三百余年，是中国历史货币发展的重要阶段。\n\n## 历史起因\n\n公元976年，宋太宗即位，改年号“太平兴国”，表示要成就一番新的事业。为了政治平衡和安抚人心，对于此次皇位更替涉及的关键人物，都做了必要安排。任命其弟赵廷美为开封尹兼中书令，封齐王；封德昭为节度使和郡王，德芳也被封为节度使。太祖和廷美的子女均称为皇子皇女，太祖的三个女儿亦封为国公主。太祖的旧部薛居正、沈伦、卢多逊、曹彬和楚昭辅等人都加官晋爵，他们的儿孙也获得相应的官位。而一些太祖在世时曾经加以处罚或意图惩处的人，太宗都予以了赦免。\n976年，宋太祖驾崩，太祖之弟赵匡义以“金匮之盟”名义登基，是为宋太宗。太宗改元太平兴国，铸太平通宝。据《宋史·食货志》载：“初，太宗改元太平兴国，更铸太平通宝。淳化改铸，又亲书淳化元宝，作真、行、草三体。后改元更铸，皆曰元宝，而冠以年号。”\n太平通宝，铸造于宋太宗赵光义太平兴国年间（976-984年），形制和宋元通宝相似，钱文书体真书兼八分，光背或有星月纹，以铜质小平钱为主，另有铁钱和铁母，版式有小平、折二、折五和折十。当时福建建州，也曾短铸太平通宝，背巨星纹，折十型，铁钱，因其铸时短、铸量少，又因是铁质，存世罕见。太宗亦铸有金质、银质太平通宝宫钱，钱文真书、隶书均有，专门用于赏赐。金质太平通宝，中国国家博物馆有藏；银质太平通宝，偶见于国内某著名藏家。\n太平通宝\n宋朝建立以后，建隆元年（960年），太祖铸“宋元通宝”钱。因为在钱币上直接使用了国号“宋”，所以被称为“国号钱”。宋朝第四位皇帝宋仁宗（1022年3月23日-1063年4月30日在位）铸造过多品“皇宋通宝”等，亦是国号钱。1979年，北京密云县的一个废旧物资回收站，曾从回收的废铜中发现一枚九叠篆“皇宋通宝”，钱文叠迭，九曲八弯，如同皇帝印玺文字，观赏性极强，为国宝级钱币珍品。九叠篆“皇宋通宝”，中国钱币博物馆亦有收藏。\n北宋时期，是中国历史上钱币铸造的高峰，数量庞大，品种繁多，工艺精致，书法瑰丽。960年，赵匡胤陈桥兵变取代后周，是为宋太祖，定都开封，建元建隆，铸宋元通宝国号钱。宋元通宝，形制仿开元通宝，深厚淳朴。976年，太祖去世，太宗即位，改元太平兴国，铸太平通宝年号钱。自太平通宝以后，铸行年号钱和对钱，成为宋朝的制度和传统。宋代一朝，几乎每改年号就铸年号钱。对钱，起源于南唐，发展在宋朝，几乎每个年号都铸对钱。据统计，北宋共历九帝，更年号35次，铸行了27种年号钱。宋太宗开中国御书钱之先河，亲笔题写了太平、淳化、至道等钱文。在位21年，共用五个年号，三个年号铸行了年号钱，即太平、淳化和至道；淳化、至道年间，均铸有楷、行、草书三体钱。还有，天圣元宝、明道元宝、景佑元宝和皇宋通宝，为仁宗朝铸，均为篆、楷书对钱。至和、嘉佑钱币，以及后来的治平、熙宁、元丰、元佑等年号钱币，均为篆、楷（行、隶）对钱。\n太平兴国元年（976年）铸造的“太平通宝”篆、隶书对钱，是宋代的第一种年号钱，之后太宗又铸行了“淳化元宝”和“至道元宝”两种三书体年号钱。此后，整个宋代一朝，几乎每逢新帝登基或改元，都铸年号钱，成为钱币铸行的基本制度和传统。特别突出的是仁宗、徽宗时期，几乎每一个年号都铸行了年号钱。仁宗在位四十一年（1022-1063年），改元九次，分别铸行了“天圣元宝”、“明道元宝”、“景祐元宝”、“康定元宝”、“庆历重宝”、“至和元宝、通宝、重宝”、“嘉祐元宝、通宝”等十种年号钱。\n徽宗赵佶，是宋代铸造年号钱最多的皇帝，在位二十五年，先后铸行了“建国通宝”、“靖国元宝”、“崇宁元宝、通宝、重宝”、“大观通宝”、“政和通宝、重宝”、“重和通宝”、“宣和元宝、通宝”等十一种年号钱。\n北宋铸行时间最长的年号钱，是仁宗天圣年间铸行的天圣元宝和神宗熙宁年间（1068-1077年）铸行的“熙宁元宝、通宝、重宝”，铸期均长达十年。南宋铸行时间最长的年号钱是高宗绍兴年间（1131-1162年）铸行的绍兴通宝，铸期达三十二年。铸期最短的年号钱是“建国通宝”（徽宗1101年铸）、“靖国元宝”（徽宗1101年铸）、“重和通宝”（徽宗1118年铸）和“开庆通宝”（南宋理宗1259年铸），因为年号存在时间短促，铸期均不到一年。\n宋代的年号钱，深刻影响了中国一千多年的钱币铸造。宋代以后，历代王朝铸行的行用钱几乎都是年号钱，年号钱成为了中国历史货币流通的主流品种。尤其是明代、清代钱币，莫不如此，所有皇朝皇帝，几乎都以同一年号钱币流通本朝始终，比如明代的洪武通宝、万历通宝，比如清代的康熙通宝、光绪通宝，直至中国最后一位皇帝溥仪宣统年间（1909-1912年）铸行的最后一种方孔钱币“宣统通宝”，也是年号钱。\n宋代非年号钱寡少，分别是建隆年间的“宋元通宝”、宝元年间的“皇宋通宝”和建中靖国时期的“圣宋元宝”等。\n宋太宗篆、隶书太平通宝，在中国货币史上的地位无可替代，它们的铸行和存在，开创了一个崭新的钱币发展时代，而且对后世钱币的铸行，影响深远。没有太平兴国年间的太平通宝篆、隶书对钱、年号钱的形制和事实，就没有太宗后来的淳化、至道年间的楷、行、草三体御书钱币，也就没有真宗、仁宗朝的祥符元、通宝、天禧通宝和天圣元宝等钱币形制。因为太平通宝篆、隶书钱币形制的发端，也因此才有了我们现在知道的整个宋代、乃至后来朝代铸行钱币的华美瑰丽的篇章。\n宋代的货币经济发展全面，开创了以铜钱为主和铜、银、钞并行的历史新时期。宋代钱币极具特色，可为承前启后，在中国钱币史上具有重要地位。而对钱、御书钱和年号钱的开启、发展和形成制度，有继往开来的功绩，为之后历代王朝的钱币铸行起到了引领和示范作用。\n宋代钱币铸行特点明显，通行铸造御书钱，时兴铸造对钱与三体钱，盛行铸造国号钱与年号钱，还出现了由当朝皇帝和文学巨匠亲自书写年号钱文的文化盛事。从北宋太祖到南宋度宗的三百余年时间里，北宋历九帝，一百六十七年，使用了三十五个年号，铸行了二十七种年号钱，有上千个版别和品种。分别是太平、淳化、至道、咸平、景德、大中祥符、天禧、天圣、明道、景祐、康定、庆历、至和、嘉祐、治平、熙宁、元丰、元祐、绍圣、元符、建中靖国、崇宁、大观、政和、重和、宣和、靖康。南宋亦历九帝，一百五十二年，改年号二十次，铸行了十九种年号钱，分别是建炎、绍兴、隆兴、乾道、纯熙、淳熙、绍熙、庆元、嘉泰、开禧、嘉定、宝庆、绍定、端平、嘉熙、淳祐、开庆、景定和咸淳。宋王朝统治的三百十七年中（960-1276年），共铸行了四十六种年号钱，几乎贯穿了整个王朝的始终。南宋度宗咸淳年间（1263-1274年）铸行的咸淳元宝，是宋朝的最后一种年号钱，之后，元军攻入南宋，宋朝灭亡，其它三个短暂的皇帝年号，未及铸钱，便夭亡了。\n宋代钱币的特点，钱文多用“宝”字，除了沿袭唐代的“宝文钱”元宝、通宝和重宝外，还出现了“天宝”、“真宝”、“永宝”、“万宝”、“兴宝”、“至宝”等钱币钱文。宋朝钱币钱文，既有文雅帝王的亲书，也有文化巨匠的挥就，可为多姿多彩。从太宗太平通宝、淳化元宝开始，经真宗、徽宗、高宗诸帝，还有苏轼、欧阳修、司马光等文学大家的参与，篆书、行书、草书、楷书、隶书五体具备，又有古篆书和九叠篆等极美书体的竞相争辉，形成宋朝主流的书法艺术，浓缩、定格了中国的书法艺术和文字发展阶段，深入千家万户，并且一直影响到现在。\n宋太宗太平通宝隶、篆书钱币，开创了中国一个钱币发展的时代。其在货币史上的重要程度，犹如唐武德四年（621年）的宝文钱开元通宝，取代了以重量为钱币名称的铢、两钱币时代。开宋代以后中国铸币对钱、三体钱、御书钱和年号钱之先河，并形成传统、制度，共同成为中国货币史重要时期的纲要钱。如果没有太平通宝隶、篆书钱币，中国的宋代钱币，宋代以后的元、明、清诸朝钱币，就不是现在这个样子，而是另一个演化、发展的形态。",

亚历山大·加斯科因\n\n《Campione弑神者！》中的角色\n\n同义词\n黑王子（《Campione》中的弑神者之一）一般指亚历山大·加斯科因\n\n亚历山大·加斯科因，外号比本人更有名，战胜掌管幻视与雷的堕天使雷米尔，篡夺了神速之权能的黑之贵公子。年轻的Campione，被称为黑王子阿雷克。与其它同族不同，充满知性、擅长智谋，不喜欢正面战斗而习惯于设计反击敌人。## 人物设定\n\n亚历山大·加斯科因，《Campione！》人物之一。\n外号比本人更有名，战胜掌管幻视与雷的堕天使雷米尔，篡夺了神速之权能的黑之贵公子。他父亲是一位神秘学学者，他懂得一点魔术，但更擅长的是赌博、戏法等，在十六岁时追寻圣杯的父亲去世并给他留下了暗号，他的冒险之旅从此展开——因古代修道士试图制造处弑神者结果失败了的仪式，他遭遇了天使雷米尔，最终凭过人的运气与敏锐的直觉取得了胜利，成为了弑神者。\n亚历山大是引起被隐藏在黑暗中的大英图书馆袭击事件、引发欧洲魔术界最大争乱的魔导圣杯抢夺，以及其它事件的男人，被称为黑王子亚雷克，为了追寻圣杯创建并率领着【王立工厂】。黑王子自认为与其它Campione不同，是个理性的人，不太擅长对付女性。在战斗中会使用咒术，不知是否因为常年与堪称魔术界顶端集团的贤人议会斗争，最终锻炼成为了一流的魔术师。追求方便的他意外的也有很多生活方面的才能，例如做菜，还是中国菜。\n\n## 权能\n\n### 电光石火\n\n（英文命名：Black Lightning）\n亚历山大从司掌雷与幻觉的堕天使『雷米尔』处篡夺的权能。缠绕着雷电的超高速移动术，伴随着火花行走的征兆，进入以无人能及的『神速』世界，并得到像猫一样轻捷的运动神经。应用范围很广，缓急控制、制造分身和飞行、使他人处于神速状态、让身体比纸还轻、掩盖气息、既无声音又无影的神速。\n但是肉体进入神速5分钟左右大脑将发出悲鸣，20分钟后将产生强烈时差模糊的不舒服感。超过界限持续使用的话，有着暂且不能返回到原来速度的副作用。作为神速共通的弱点，精密的运动也很困难。\n之后亚历山大开发出了将身体部分甚至全部化为『雷电的显身』。随意加速飞行、一边放电一边冲撞让对方触电，远距离放出雷光弹，雷电形态而能回避许多攻击。\n这种状态减轻神速造成的身体负担，但是campione的肉体本来持有的强力的魔术耐性将会失去。如果是神与弑神者使出破解术的话很容易被解除，要是有数位最顶级的魔法师联手施法的话说不定也能破除。\n此外，还有『黑色雷霆』这种能够烧毁地面的攻击形态，将雷电的力量爆裂放出，有着堪比护堂持有太阳轰击化身『白马』的破坏力。可是一旦使用出这个后，半天内都无法施展神速和雷电化了。\n神速是亚历山大的招牌也是他战斗的核心，以神速制造优势从而施展计略，他对神速的操作几乎无人能及。\n\n### 复仇的女神\n\n（英文命名：Judge of Furies）\n亚历山大从希腊神话的复仇三女神『厄里倪厄斯』（墨纪拉、提西福涅、阿勒克托）处篡夺的权能。\n召唤复仇的三姐妹形成「复仇领域」，三女神将眼前进行的攻击和诅咒，根据亚历山大的指示返还给攻击者。不是单纯是反弹，只是将被打伤害进行返还的能力。为了能够返还足够的威力，需要接受相应的伤害。可以同时展开多个复仇领域。\n召唤需要一定时间的冥想和仪式，事先召唤到身边、预先设置为陷阱是基本用法。一开始就暴露女神姿态，瞬间展开领域也能够做到。冥想时消耗咒力可以缩短准备时间，也可以把亚历山大自己的痛苦和血做为粮食瞬间召唤。\n女神们可以复制对手的技能和武器直接使用。女神们能反射的威力上限相当高，肉体也很结实，大部分的攻击都会弹开，受到超过上限的伤害被杀权能将解除。\n战绩：\n魔王内战篇在跟东尼的对战时，不但反弹了东尼的必杀魔剑，还复制了东尼的银手和七成的武艺，三个女神同时进攻让东尼陷入不利。\n言灵：“聆听吧，永恒的夜之女儿们啊，地与影之女儿们啊！以恶制恶、以罪偿罪、以血祭血、以牙还牙、以此为复仇之起始。被仇人所杀母亲之血，以最悲惨之死状告知已报恩无门！鬼女墨盖拉啊，复仇者提西福涅啊，永无止尽之阿勒克托啊，快将诅咒返回，执行复仇！如今正是复仇之时。”\n\n### 大迷宫\n\n（英文命名：The Labyrinth）\n亚历山大从克里特传说的大地和迷宫之神『米诺斯』处篡夺的权能。\n在地底和建筑物中创造巨大的迷宫，把对手拉进来。天空与海也能作为对象，根据展开的地势变化为迷惑的森林、魔之海域等，在地上建造迷宫时，有必要事先掌握周边地形。\n作为迷宫主人的亚历山大，有着诸如瞬间移动到迷宫中心等特权。迷宫被雾的结界包围，也可以将指定敌人排除在迷宫以外。亚历山大不在时，能够让牛头怪的显身管理迷宫。迷宫1个月只能使用一次，失去魔力供给的迷宫在3、4个月后消灭。\n\n### 无貌的女王\n\n（英文命名：Queen the Faceless）\n亚历山大从欧洲传说的双尾美人鱼、半人半蛇的女神『梅露辛』处篡夺的权能，将作为人鱼女王的梅露辛本人作为使魔召唤。上半身是长着白鸟翅膀的红色长发女性，下半身是蛇的躯体、尾巴有鱼鳍的身姿。投掷水矛进行战斗，能够轻易粉碎钢铁。\n受到绝对不能被“看见脸”的规所制约，打破的话便马上消失，无法用于近身战。机动力、破坏力都无可挑剔，可以应对陆海空的所有战斗，可以自由伸缩，最大化可以到10米以上。因为是女神本人，所以智力很高，可以用于搜索、魔术、占卜、诱拐等。潜入对方的影子里，暗中进行护卫也能够做到。亚历山大把她当作万能的助手，十分宝贵的权能。\n\n### 贪欲的魔球\n\n（英文命名：Weird Greed）\n亚历山大从巨兽『贝希摩斯』处篡夺来的吸引和重压的权能。\n制造出直径2、30m的黑色球体，将对方吸引并束缚。在宛如黑洞般可怕的吸引力中，即便是神也不能轻易的挣脱，如果不能使用神速全力奔跑也难逃束缚。调节出力，例如一瞬间消除引力，利用这个破坏敌人的姿势。\n因为球体的移动速度极慢，和《复仇的女神》一样需要预先作为陷阱设置。降低吸引力的话，球体的尺寸可以变小。\n\n## 所弑神明\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 堕天使雷米尔雷米尔是《以诺书》中的人物，是背教者的导师，是堕天使之一，掌管幻视与雷，对魂魄之事知之甚详，但也是常侍神前的七名大天使之一，负有传达七名大天使的指示的责任。 |  |\n|

比蒙巨兽贝希摩斯比蒙是陆上最大的生物，每天能吞食一千座山峰。它无法离开那些山峰，否则时间就会紊乱。因为它饕餮无厌，上帝仅造了一只（一说原有一对，后上帝将雌兽杀死）。根据《约伯记》，比蒙是首个造物，但是照《次经》记载，比蒙与利维坦（Leviathan）都在创世第五天诞生：圣经约伯记并没有说其是首个受造之物，只是说“He is the chief of the ways of God”即“它在神所造的物中为首。”“在第五日，汝对那七分之一有水聚集的部分说，应有动物、飞禽和鱼类：事儿就这么成了。对于毫无生命的死水依照神的诫命产生生命这件事，所有人都得赞颂您的伟绩。而后汝挑选两只动物，其一汝称作贝希摩斯，另一称作利维坦。并且将它们彼此分开：对那七分之一，即是，有水聚集的那部分，或许容它们不下。对于贝希摩斯汝给一部分，就是在第三天里被弄干的那部分，它就住在那里，那里有一千座山。而对于利维坦汝给那七分之一部分，即是，那潮湿之处；并命它吞噬汝所厌弃的，在恰当时候。”（《次经·以斯拉下》第6章第47至52节）

{"name": "企业号航空母舰", "documents": ["企业号航空母舰（英文：USS Enterprise，舷号：CV-6，中文：常被意译为“进取”号或“勇往”号，绰号：大E/Big E，幸运E/Lucky E），是服役于美国海军的第六艘航空母舰，是约克城级航空母舰的二号舰\n。\n企业号航空母舰在二战太平洋战争中参与了包括中途岛战役、东所罗门群岛海战、圣克鲁斯群岛海战、瓜达尔卡纳尔岛战役、菲律宾海海战、莱特湾海战在内的一系列重要战斗，成为太平洋战争中美国海军战斗资历最深厚，功勋最卓著的战舰，日本曾三次单方面宣布企业号被击沉，但最后均被证伪，因此企业号又有“灰色幽灵（Gray Ghost）的绰号。\n企业号航空母舰舰名源自美国独立战争期间俘获并更名的一艘英国单桅纵帆船，也是美国历史上第七艘以“企业”命名的舰船。\n，于1933年8月3日批准建造，1934年7月6日在弗吉尼亚州纽波特纽斯造船厂开工，1936年10月3日下水，1938年5月12日入役，1947年2月17日退役并报废处理\n。\n\n## 发展沿革\n\n### 研制背景\n\n1921年11月，在美国的首都华盛顿，当时世界的五个海军强国，美、英、日、法、意的代表皆汇集于此，目的是为了削减各国海军的军备，同时预防可能到来的军备竞赛，减轻各国财政负担。经过数月的协商，与会国之间彼此达成了共识，签订了《五国关于限制海军军备条约》，史称《华盛顿海军条约》 （Washington Naval Treaty），该条约明确规定美、英、日、法、意五国海军的主力舰（战列舰和战列巡洋舰）总吨位比例为10：10：6：3.5：3.5，签约国建造的战舰单舰最大吨位不得超过35560公吨，主力舰主炮口径不得超过16英寸（406 毫米）。条约同时规定各签约国的航空母舰总吨位不得超过以下的标准：美国135000长吨（137160公吨），英国135000长吨（137160公吨），法国60000长吨（60960公吨），意大利60000长吨（60960公吨），日本81000长吨（82296公吨）。\n1922年，在《华盛顿海军条约》的基础上，美国开始了自己的航母发展历程。按照条约美国海军可建造排水总量135000吨的航空母舰，但每艘新造航母的排水量不得超过27000吨，而两艘获准由其他舰船改建的航母每艘则不得超过33000吨，美国当时的CV-2“列克星敦”号与CV-3“萨拉托加”号两舰由战列巡洋舰改造为列克星敦级航空母舰，在官方上占去66000吨；1922年服役的带有实验性质的CV-1兰利号航空母舰则不计算入吨位总量之内，因此海军在字面上只有69000吨可用作建造新航母。\n\n1922年到1929年间，美国海军建造及维修署、海军航空署及海军事务委员会均在钻研新式航空母舰设计，而新设计最大的争论，正是如何“有效地”运用余下的吨位。争论的焦点在于航母数量与大小，倘若采用小型化13800吨的方案，则海军可新增5艘航空母舰；倘若采用较大型方案，则建造数量较少，为4艘17250吨级或者3艘23000吨级。\n\n新建航母数量与大小的争论背后，牵涉到航母各方面的运用疑难。由于当时没有舰载雷达，航母很容易被发现，必须可以高速逃脱，美国海军内部一致同意航母应有高速航行能力，但相应的引擎空间便愈大占用更多吨位。大型航母可装设抵御巡洋舰火炮的装甲，至于小型航母则无可避免较弱。然而，海军同时要考虑飞行设施问题，倘若小型航母牺牲防御，而换取更多机库空间，则两艘小型航母的载机量比一艘大型航母多，可更有效运用条约吨位。大型航母设计虽在航海及执勤性能上，都远胜小型设计，但整体可建造数量却相对较少，且在战后紧缩军费的情况下难以建造。另外，大型航母设计使海军航空力量集中在少数军舰，使舰队在单次攻击损失全部航空力量的风险增加。相信航母有独立作战能力的战斗舰队航空指挥官约瑟·李维，以及航空署署长威廉·莫斐德，则聚焦于增加舰队整体的舰载机携带数量，这样小型化设计正好满足各方所需。\n\n1929年，在日内瓦海军裁减会议与建造巡洋舰的争议声下，一艘小型航母设计列入该年度的美国海军拨款法案，联同巡洋舰拨款，获得美国国会两院通过，最终成为1933年2月入役的排水量13800吨的CV-4游骑兵号航空母舰（亦称突击者号）\n\n。然而就在法案辩论之时，美国海军举办了第9号舰队解难演习。在约瑟·李维的领导下，“萨拉托加”号航母在演习中充分展现了大型航母的独立战斗力、机动性及强大打击力。之后1930年至1933年的演习，列克星敦级的两艘大型航母也延续了上述的优点。\n1930年，美国海军事务委员会提出修正讨论，建议将来多建造一艘小型航母，以及两艘增大吨位的中型航母。小型航母可用作跟从战列舰作战，而中型航母则可独立成为打击力量，既满足海军的战术需要，又尽用余下吨位。\n\n1931年，在吸收了前四艘航母的经验教训后，美国计划建造两艘新的约克城级航空母舰（Yorktown class aircraft carrier），单舰排水量约为19800长吨。1932年初，海军事务委员会终于从多项设计中，选择了排水20000吨、长770尺、宽80.3尺、120000轴马力，最高航速32.5节、搭载90架舰载机的方案。然而国会以经济萧条为因，并未拨款建造新型航母，使设计又再拖延，期间海军部长曾要求军部研究装设8英寸火炮的27000吨方案，但最终流产。\n\n### 建造沿革\n\n1933年，富兰克林·罗斯福就任美国总统后，海军造舰计划终于获得政治上的支持。首先，小罗斯福为整顿市场，刺激经济，实施了一系列旨在克服危机的政策措施，其中“以工代赈”造福了美国海军，通过动用全国工业复兴法\n的资金，以援助失业造船工人为名，拨款建造两艘航空母舰及若干驱逐舰，这批资金无须经正常国会程序拨款。国会提供了高达两亿三千八百万美元的拨款，用于更新舰艇装备，这一举措使得两艘航母的建设预算一下子增加了八千万美金，大大提高了建造质量。最终争论的中型航母设计变成了最初的两艘约克城级航空母舰，而小型航母设计后来则成为黄蜂号航空母舰（亦称胡峰号）。1934年5月21日，按照1932年的航母设计蓝本，约克城级首舰CV-5“约克城”号在纽波特纽斯造船及船坞公司（现诺斯罗普·格鲁曼造船厂）旗下的造船厂动工\n\n。\n1934年7月6日，约克城级2号舰CV-6企业号（USS Enterprise）也在纽波特纽斯造船厂开工，7月16日开始铺设龙骨。此时海军仍在飞行甲板长度、防空炮装备及位置等方面仍有所争辩，然而随着游骑兵号航母在1933年下水\n，加上美国海军航空战术与经验长足的发展，原航母过苛的浓缩设计弱点显露无遗，这样争辩到1934年11月已有定论。\n\n1936年10月3日，企业号航空母舰下水，时任美国海军部长夫人克劳德·A·斯旺森女士主持了掷瓶仪式。\n\n### 服役历程\n\n1938年5月12日，企业号正式入役，首任舰长是小牛顿·怀特（Newton H. White, Jr），第一趟试航至里约热内卢。之后的1939年1月2日，在安普顿港群进行休整后，企业号又驶向南方，途径圣托马斯岛和关塔那摩湾，与“约克城”号一同参加位于加勒比海地区举行的舰队演习。指挥两艘航母的是“蛮牛将军”小威廉·弗雷德里克·哈尔西少将，这位个性剽悍爽朗的将军给企业号的船员们留下了深刻的印象，也决定了企业号未来在战斗中凌厉威猛的性格。在波纳尔接过指挥棒的四个月后，也就是1939年4月，企业号被正式编入太平洋舰队序列，母港为加利福尼亚州圣迭戈。\n\n企业号几乎参加了太平洋的所有重要战役，在二战中共获20枚战斗之星勋章，\n\n约克城级三艘中只有企业号服役到了战争的结束。\n1946年1月18日，企业号进入了纽约美国海军船坞解除服役状态，并在1947年2月17日退役，转入大西洋预备舰队。美国许多人和团体努力想将企业号保留为博物馆/纪念船并组成了“企业号协会”，美国海军也同意只要在一定时间内募集足够资金，便让协会优先买下，但筹款活动却无法在时限内募集到足够资金。1952年10月1日称为攻击航母CVA-6，1953年8月8日又改称反潜航母CVS-6，1956年10月2日从海军舰艇名册中除籍。\n最后企业号被海军以561333美元的价格出售并在1958年7月1日于新泽西州开始解体，海军答应保留企业号那独特的三角桅杆，不过却没有履行诺言，最后在1960年3月被彻底解体，为了纪念企业号，美国海军将第一艘核动力航空母舰CVN-65同样取名为企业号。\n\n历任舰长\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| 小牛顿·H·怀特上校 | 查尔斯·A·波纳尔上校 | 乔治·D·莫里上校 |\n| Captain Newton H.

设计特点\n\n企业号和同级的“约克城”号、“大黄蜂”号从美国海军之前的几艘航母的改装、设计和建造上获得了经验，因此其设计较旧型航母有很大的不同\n\n。企业号的排水量比“列克星敦”号和“萨拉托加”号小了三分之一，却可以装载与后两者数量相同的舰载机和多30%的航空燃料，并拥有更强的机动性，转向更为灵活。当然在提升性能的过程中，约克城级也作出了很多牺牲，为了减轻排水量，约克城级减少了装甲的厚度和防御武器的数量，其中最致命的缺陷弱点仍在水线以下舰体防御方面，而此情况更因动力系统的配置而恶化。约克城级的9座锅炉分成3列，全部排在前方，而轮机则在其后方，倘若遭鱼雷攻击，水线以下一旦入水，海水只需淹没锅炉或轮机，便足以令全舰失去动力。\n\n不过即便如此，其内部的上百个水密舱也可以保证在恶劣战况下舰体不会轻易沉没。企业号两艘同级舰“约克城”号和“大黄蜂”号分别于中途岛战役和圣克鲁斯群岛战役中沉没，且都是毁于日本鱼雷轰炸机之手，但是值得注意的是，两艘船在被弹后并没有立刻沉没，而是与进水“对抗”了很长一段时间。由于企业号最大的弱点在于对鱼雷的防御能力不足，作为1943年改装的重要一环，企业号在水线位置加装了鱼雷防水壁，覆盖全舰水线大约四分之三\n。\n\n### 舰型结构\n\n舰型\n企业号航空母舰采用了开放式机库，拥有3部14.6米×13.4米升降机，单台载重7711千克。飞行甲板前端装有2具弹射器，另外在机库也设置了2具弹射器，紧急情况下舰载机可以通过其从机库中直接弹射起飞，但后来在战前已发现其效率低下，遂取消了这项不实用的功能，于1942年中途岛海战后拆除。飞行甲板前后安装了两组拦阻索，飞机可以在飞行甲板的任一端降落，但舰艏降落设施也因鲜有使用，而在后来拆除，其他飞行设施则未有显著更动。木制飞行甲板没有装甲防护，舰桥、桅杆和烟囱一体化的岛式上层建筑位于右舷。\n\n装甲\n企业号甲板装甲厚1.5英寸（3.81 厘米），火控中心装甲厚4.0英寸（10.2 厘米），水线装甲厚4.8英寸（12.2 厘米）；舰侧装设2.5-4英寸装甲带，以抵挡6英寸火炮；3层鱼雷防水壁，配合装甲带防止鱼雷攻击；水平装甲设于机库，以阻止炸弹贯穿到下层机房及武器库；飞行甲板由木板制造，不设装甲\n。\n涂装\n企业号在战前都涂上了灰色，为方便演习时识别。\n1942年初，约克城级三舰均涂上了第12号迷彩，其大体布置为：水线至机库甲板下涂上海军蓝，机库甲板至舰岛之间为海洋灰，舰岛为阴霾灰，飞行甲板为甲板蓝，各舰迷彩的分划界线并不一致。\n\n1943年，企业号返国维修后，换上了第21号迷彩，全舰均涂上海军蓝，有蓝色幽灵之称的CV-16“列克星敦”号航空母舰亦采用此法。1944年，企业号再更换为第33号迷彩，舰体侧面混合了浅灰及海洋灰。至于舰体平面与甲板，则由甲板蓝及海洋灰组成。新迷彩的目标，在于迷惑潜艇及飞机计算舰体航速，而非避过侦察。1945年，战争结束后，企业号换回第21号全身海军蓝迷彩，并将舷号6以白色油漆画于飞行甲板，参与纽约海军节的庆祝活动。\n\n### 舰载武器\n\n防御\n约克城级航母最初舰艏及舰艉各设有4座，共8座单管5英寸38倍径高平两用炮，分别置于左舷及右舷飞行甲板；舰岛前方及后方各设有2座，共4座四联装1.1英寸75倍径高射炮；舰体各处共有24挺勃朗宁M2 .50口径机关枪，虽火力充足，但威力太小\n。\n5英寸38倍径高平两用炮是当时美国最新式的防空及水平两用舰炮，其双联装版本亦被后来的埃塞克斯级航母沿用，虽然射程远，但射速太慢，在火控雷达和近炸引信弹药列装前并不实用。\n1934年时，美国海军就发现1.1英寸75倍径高射炮有卡弹及操作问题，而勃朗宁机枪的口径过小，无法有效击毁俯冲飞机。1939年，美国海军武备署已着手处理舰队防空炮落后问题，并在1940年开始生产博福斯40毫米口径高射炮及厄利孔20毫米单管重机枪，分别替换1.1英寸75倍径高射炮及勃朗宁机枪。\n\n在战争初期，企业号搭载的各种长枪短炮显得极具魄力，但在面对铺天盖地而来的日本轰炸机时却派不上多大用场。\n1942年春季，情况开始有所改观，在航空母舰大战之后，美国海军开始意识到防空对于水面舰艇的重要性。企业号在空袭东京前夕，一次过安装了32挺厄利孔20毫米单管重机枪，事实证明，这些大口径的“小家伙”活力十足，在东所罗门群岛和圣克鲁斯群岛的作战中，被打下来的日本飞机有相当大的一部分是20毫米口径机枪的杰作。不过，厄利孔20毫米口径机枪也有其弱点，那就是射程太短，没法提前击落敌机，这时候就该博福斯40毫米口径高射炮发挥作用了。1942年，博福斯40毫米口径高射炮在圣克鲁斯海战前安装到企业号及其护航舰南达科他号，连同5英寸38倍径高平两用炮构成了中远距离上的火力防御网，这也是企业号得以幸存的原因之一。\n1943年后，海军乘企业号返国大修之机开始大幅加装防空炮，到1943年末，企业号同其他战舰一道又进行了武器升级，火控系统也做了升级-5英寸防空炮和40毫米防空炮可以由雷达引导射击，这赋予了企业号全天候防御的能力，使其防空火力较同级舰较优。\n到1945年战争末期，除了原装的8座单管5英寸38倍径高平两用炮外，企业号的防空武器已增为11座四联装博福斯高射炮、5座双联装博福斯高射炮及16挺双联装20毫米重机枪。\n企业号在1941年至1945年间防御武器配置变化较大，战时改装也折射出了太平洋战争的实际需求，即巨舰大炮时代已成为过往，航空母舰时代开始到来\n。\n\n舰载机\n约克城级航母在服役之初，仍搭载二战前的飞机，包括格鲁门公司的F2F战斗机及F3F战斗机、马丁公司的鱼雷-俯冲两用BM轰炸机及诺斯洛普公司的BT俯冲轰炸机。“约克城”号与企业号在1941年换上F4F战斗机，并在1942年换上SBD轰炸机、TBD轰炸机及TBF轰炸机。\n1942年初，美国海军尚未有完善的雷达系统，再加上海军承袭战前的攻击优先战术，约克城级初期俱以轰炸机为航空团核心。比如在中途岛海战中，企业号的航空团是由1支F4F战斗机小队、1支TBD鱼雷轰炸机小队、1支SBD俯冲轰炸机小队及1支SBD侦察机小队组成。战斗机有21架至25架不等，俯冲轰炸机有37架至38架，鱼雷轰炸机则有13架至15架，总共携带了79架。瓜岛战役开始后，企业号陆续增加战斗机数量，并减少鱼雷轰炸机及俯冲轰炸机，最大可载96架，常规搭载80-90架\n。\n1943年晚期，企业号换上F6F战斗机，到1944年中，企业号曾混合F6F及F4U战斗机，并换上SB2C轰炸机。此时企业号一般会携带超过34架战斗机、21至30架俯冲轰炸机及14至16架鱼雷轰炸机。\n1945年，企业号改装为夜战航空母舰，其航空团专门负责晚间及破晓前的战机戒备，舰载机数量下降至53至61架，并且全由装设雷达的F6F及TBM“复仇者”组成。\n\n### 舰电系统\n\n射控系统\n美国航母最初的射控系统，都只能以准星及曳光弹瞄准，后来又加装了光学目测镜，但防空武器仍然全由人手瞄准。“约克城”号与企业号服役之初，在烟囱前后均各装有一座Mark 33射控系统。Mark 33是专门为5英寸/38火炮而设计，相比起上一代手动操作的Mark 19及Mark 28，Mark 33完全以电力运作，以电脑测量距离，可更有效测出飞机的距离及高度。1943年企业号返国大修时，将Mark 33系统也升级为Mark 37。Mark 37体积比Mark 33大，可容纳更大的电脑，以提升效能。更有甚者，Mark 37的电脑及支撑点都在射控装置下方的甲板，而非装置内部，使系统有充足空间升级来安装新式辅助设备，Mark 33及Mark 37均可安装辅助火控雷达。\n\n1942年，美国预备将第一代防空-水平两用舰炮的FD火控雷达（即Mark 4）安装到“约克城”号及企业号，然而“约克城”号在中途岛海战沉没未能实现，企业号则在稍后安装了两座以辅助Mark 33引导5英寸炮射击。FD火控雷达可侦察12000码内5英寸炮弹落点，探测到40000码内的轰炸机、30000码内的战列舰、20000码内的驱逐舰及12000码内浮上水面的潜艇，准确度为40码，分辨率400码。1945年，企业号因自杀飞机受创而返国维修时将FD雷达换上新产品Mark12/22火控雷达，但这对即将退役的企业号执勤没有影响\n。\n\n舰载雷达\n约克城级航母在设计之时，雷达技术尚未成熟。1937年海军研发出首批舰用搜索雷达，并在1940年命名为CXAM，安装到多艘舰只。“约克城”号在1940年安装了CXAM雷达，而企业号则在1941年安装了CXAM-1型雷达。CXAM的准确度为300码，分辨率400码，一般可探测到16海里内的战列舰、12海里内的驱逐舰、70海里内10000英尺高的PBY水上飞机或50海里内同等高度的战斗机，而CXAM-1的准确度则提升为200码。由于CXAM雷达过于笨重，“大黄蜂”号在1941年服役时，安装了新式的SC雷达，但搜索距离却大幅下降，只可探测到10海里内的战列舰、3海里内的驱逐舰、30海里内的战斗机及25海里内的轰炸机。\n企业号在1942年下半年安装了SG雷达，用作水平搜索，其准确度为200码，分辨率400码，可侦察15海里内于500英尺低空的轰炸机、22海里内的战列舰及15海里内的驱逐舰。企业号同时安装了SC-1型雷达，其搜索距离比SC雷达增加一倍，准确度提升至100码，分辨率则为500码。1943年企业号返国大修时，将CXAM-1雷达替换为新式SK雷达，搜索距离激增至100海里内10000英尺高空的中型轰炸机，准确度为100码，分辨率为900码。企业号同时加装了SM雷达，搜索距离为50海里内10000英尺高空的飞机，以及25海里内的战列舰，准确度为500至200码，分辨率200码。SM雷达是美军第一批战斗机调配雷达，到此时美国航母才可有效调配战斗机拦截敌军飞机。连同额外增设的YG返航装置，以及IFF敌我辨识系统，企业号的雷达及电子设备可与1943年新服役的埃塞克斯级航空母舰相比。\n二战末期，企业号又将SC-1型雷达改为新型SR雷达，准确度为30至100码，分辨率500码，可探测110海里内10000英尺高空的轰炸机、75海里内同等高度的战斗机、以及25海里内500英尺低空飞行的轰炸机。企业同时设有作战指挥系统的雏型，战时会派出载有远程雷达的TBM轰炸机，将其数据传返舰上处理分析。企业号亦在1945年安装了初期的电子干扰系统，可以干扰敌方无线电信号。\n\n### 改装升级\n\n1943年，企业号在返国大修时，则按照战时经验作出多项改动。首先，企业号在舰体两侧对全舰3/4的水线部位加设6英尺鱼雷防水壁，加强水下防御，又可提供额外浮力，应付日益增加的舰体吨位。设计时约克城级的满载排水量约为23000吨左右，但战时新增的防空炮、雷达及各种飞机武器，使舰体实际排水量节节上升。1942年，企业号的满载排水量超过26000吨，到1944年已达29000吨，而1945年更上升至32000吨，防水壁亦可令舰体航行更为稳定。\n企业号的燃料库改为马鞍状设计，先设立一大型中央燃料库，再在其外围建造小型的储存库，以马鞍状将之包围，而马鞍状储存库外再以同样方法建造隔壁，此法可减低油库受攻击后大量泄漏的危机。大修期间，美军的抢修管理经验亦有长进。企业号延长了飞行甲板，防空火炮增加到双联20毫米厄立孔25座，四联40毫米博福斯高炮10座，所有高炮均有雷达指控，命中率大为提高。同时舰载机已换成全新的F6F“地狱猫”，SB2C“地狱俯冲者”和TBF“复仇者”。此外，企业号的通风系统、救火设施、飞机油站也于同时再作改良。\n\n##

服役动态\n\n1940年5月，企业号和太平洋舰队的大部分船只一同转移到位于夏威夷珍珠港的海军基地，目的是为了阻止日本向南太平洋侵略的野心，尽管后来的事实证明这一行为起到的作用正好相反，不过这并未影响到企业号的日常活动。作为珍珠港基地仅有的两艘航空母舰，企业号和“列克星敦”号不断地磨砺着自己的船员，为应对从西方飘来的战争阴云作准备。\n1941年，企业号开始往返于珍珠港和美国西海岸之间，运送陆军航空兵部队的P-39“飞蛇”式战斗机和P-40“战斧”式战斗机，以及大批兵力、军火，依照计划这些部队将在1942年中期被部署至威克岛、关岛以西。企业号执行最后一次运送任务的离港时间是1941年11月28日，当时正在哈尔西率领下向威克岛输送海军陆战队航空兵和他们的飞机，而在两天之前，日本第一航空舰队已经集结完毕，悄悄地驶向珍珠港。12月2日，海军陆战队航空兵驾机升空，飞向威克岛，而企业号则掉头返回珍珠港，然而天气让企业号放慢了步伐同时也为日本舰队提供了天然掩护，错过了12月6日的归港时间，这次延误使企业号避开了日本海军的锋芒，也避免了和珍珠港内一众战舰相同的下场。\n1941年12月7日，从日本航母上起飞的183架飞机扑向珍珠港，给了美国海军致命的一击。当第一颗日本炸弹落在美国领土上时，企业号还在距瓦胡岛241公里开外的海面上，刚好避开了日军的袭击，企业号从自己的飞行员那里得知珍珠港遇袭的消息的。偷袭过后，企业号立刻起航搜寻日本舰队，但是很显然一无所获，得手的日本航母编队已经悄然远去。袭击第二天薄暮时分，企业号航母编队驶入了珍珠港，在暮色和熊熊浓烟的掩罩下，开始了彻夜的补给。第二天早晨六点，穿过漂浮于海口的残骸，企业号驶向了辽阔的太平洋。\n\n在随后劫机日海军攻击舰队过程中，企业号又与支援威克岛登陆的日本第二航空战队苍龙号飞龙号擦肩而过，之后企业号参与了一系列的寻求战略平衡的袭击任务。\n\n1942年1月11日，海军中将哈尔西指挥以企业号为核心的TF8编队（1航母、4重型巡洋舰、6驱逐舰）与TF17（“约克城”号，1轻型巡洋舰，4驱逐舰，弗莱彻海军少将指挥）协同，完成增援萨摩亚岛的作战，共向岛上输送兵员5000人。1942年2月1日，在增援萨摩亚返航途中，TF8编队对日占马绍尔群岛中防御最坚固的罗伊岛，夸贾林环礁、沃特吉环礁和马洛埃拉普环礁上的日军基地进行了空袭，击沉日军小型舰艇4艘，击毁飞机18架，连第6根据地队的八代佑吉少将也被炸死，这是美军自太平洋战争开始以来第一次有组织的反攻，企业号由此享有反击前锋的美誉。当时南云忠一指挥的五航空战队4艘航母正在支援拉包尔登陆，得知马绍尔群岛遭袭击后，立即高速向东追击。追了一整天后，得到美国广播“袭击马绍尔群岛成功，舰队返航”的消息后才放弃追赶。2月14日，企业号又袭击日本占领的威克岛。1942年4月8日，企业号离开珍珠港前往阿留申群岛，在那里与“大黄蜂”号航母编队汇合后，掩护其编队执行轰炸日本本土的任务（即著名的“杜立特空袭”）。\n\n1942年6月2日，中途岛海战中，斯普鲁恩斯率领企业号和“大黄蜂”号在中途岛东北埋伏。6月4日晨，33架轰炸机、14架鱼雷机和10架战斗机于企业号起飞。到达预定目标上空后，日本舰队已北撤。企业号进攻编队均向北搜索，但以缺乏配合的方式发动了进攻，战斗机在高空一直没有下来；14架鱼雷机在低空大部分被击落，无一雷命中；但企业号的俯冲轰炸机却得到了最好的机会，33架分4编队向最大的两个目标赤城号和加贺号俯冲，，最终使赤城号和加贺号沉没，并重创了飞龙号。同时企业号上的舰载航空兵和中途岛上的岸基航空兵部队携手击沉日本三偎号重巡洋舰。\n\n1942年7月，企业号又参加了瓜岛的一系列海空战，支援美军两栖登陆。同年8月24日，它跟“萨拉托加”号航母一起，击沉了日本轻型航母龙骧号以及2艘运输船，重创了巡洋舰和驱逐舰各一艘。但企业号自己被命中7颗炸弹，受了重伤，舰员74人被炸死，95人受伤。由于抢险方式得当，及时控制住大火，企业号艰难地返回珍珠港修理。\n\n1942年8月，美国海军与日本联合舰队在西南太平洋海域开始了争夺瓜达尔卡纳尔岛控制权的鏖战。在8月24日进行的所罗门以东海战中，企业号被翔鹤号上的18架九九舰爆突破空中防御圈，共命中250公斤穿甲弹3枚，另有4枚近失。空袭过后，企业号燃起大火，飞行甲板严重受损，77人阵亡，91人受伤，击落九九舰爆17架，零战3架。受损1小时后，企业号恢复到24节航速，还重新开始了回收舰载机的作业。在此次作战中，企业号所在的TF61编队击沉日本轻型航母龙骧，重创水上飞机母舰千岁号，击落日机75架。\n1942年10月16日，企业号搭载了新编成的第10舰载机大队（AG-10），这个大队包括了从受损的“萨拉托加”号和被击沉的“约克城”号上调来的优秀飞行员，战斗力有所加强。\n1942年10月26日，企业号与“大黄蜂”号又参加了瓜岛的圣克鲁斯海战。企业号最初躲在暴雨下免受了第一轮的攻击，同时其舰载机会同“大黄蜂”号的舰载机多次对日本舰队发起攻击，击落击毁日机92架，重创日本翔鹤号、瑞鹤号两艘航母，击沉一艘巡洋舰。同时日本翔鹤飞行队长村田少佐，关卫少佐，瑞鹤飞行队长今宿滋一郎大尉等一大批优秀飞行员战死，日本机动部队战斗力被极大削弱。但在日舰随后的进攻中，企业号再次被命中6枚250公斤炸弹，另有1枚近失，但侥幸躲过了所有鱼雷，也受重伤，死44人，伤75人。企业号带伤收回被击沉的“大黄蜂”号上的舰载机后撤离战区。\n可是局势不允许企业号返回美国修理，美国已经有3艘航母被日方击沉，主兵力当时只有企业号，附近就有一支日本舰队随时都会发起新的攻击。企业号只好一边航行，一边抢修。\n1942年11月11日，企业号开出努美阿，带伤赶到战场，带着修理舰AR-4女灶神号（USS Vestal ）赶赴瓜岛以东海域，边修边战，以最大限度增强美军的空中力量。11月13日凌晨，负责炮击任务的日军“挺身队”与美军TF67巡洋舰编队相遇，爆发激战，美军损失2艘轻巡和4艘驱逐舰，击沉日军2艘驱逐舰，并重创比睿号战列舰。天亮之后，企业号出马，与瓜岛起飞的TBF鱼雷攻击机共同攻击，使比睿号命中1雷，舰尾下沉。并最终于13日天黑前后自沉，这是日本在太平洋战争中损失的第一艘战列舰。此时企业号仍然是美军在太平洋上唯一的一艘可用航母，水兵们在机库甲板上漆上的这样的标语，企业号对抗日本（Enterprise VS Japan），14日企业号的舰载机又击沉日本一艘重巡洋舰，直到11月16日它才返回美国修理。\n\n1943年1月，企业号又重返前线参战，在所罗门群岛海域，为美国舰队提供空中保护，时间长达3个月。1943年1月30日，日军出动11架一式陆攻轰炸伦内尔岛附近的美军水面舰艇编队，企业号击落其中的7架，但仍有8架日机发射了鱼雷，CA-29芝加哥号重型巡洋舰被击沉。5月26日，企业号返回珍珠港，5月27日接受尼米兹海军上将代表罗斯福总统颁发的总统单位嘉奖。7月20日，新的埃塞克斯级航母开始服役，企业号终于回到本土进行大规模整修和改装。\n1944年1月6日，完成改装的企业号与其他5艘大型航母组成TF58特混编队，参加马绍尔群岛作战。TF58包括6艘大型舰队航母，6艘独立级轻型航母，6艘护航航母，15艘战列舰，9艘重巡洋舰，6艘轻巡洋舰，50艘驱逐舰，以及多艘运输舰，货船，油船，坦克登陆舰，船坞登陆舰，水上飞机母舰和其他辅助舰船，舰载机超过700架。1月31日，在TF58强大火力支援下，美军攻克了马绍尔群岛中的夸贾林环礁、马朱罗环礁等多个岛屿。\n1944年2月27日，TF58编队对特鲁克环礁实施攻击，企业号上搭载的装有雷达的TBF复仇者夜间攻击机参与空袭行动，此役共击沉舰艇9艘，特设舰船3艘，运输船31艘，总计237000吨，击毁飞机270架。其中1/3的战果由企业号取得。3月至6月间，企业号又参加了一系列海岛和支援登陆战。它在马里亚纳与日本航母展开的大战，日本3艘航母被击沉，426架飞机被摧毁，从此日本海军大伤元气。在这次大战中，企业号又立下新功。\n\n1944年6月，美日海军在马里亚纳海域展开战略决战，日本海军损失3艘大型航母和600余架飞机，两年来惨淡经营的航空兵力量损失殆尽。而美军仅损失飞机130架，76名飞行员阵亡（其中在夜间着陆时，损失飞机77架，44名飞行员阵亡）。\n1944年10月25日，企业号舰载机协助友舰击沉超级战列舰武藏号、航母瑞鹤、瑞凤和千岁号。此役中，企业号是少数几艘对栗田、小泽、西村舰队均实施攻击的美国航母。1944年12月，企业号成为CVN-6（N为夜间的缩写），搭载经改装的F6F-5N夜间战斗机，执行夜间巡逻任务。\n1945年，企业号开始搭载夜间战斗机，成为拥有全天候作战能力的航空母舰（CVA-6）。1945年2月，企业号又支援美军在硫黄岛的登陆作战，企业号舰载机曾不间断地在岛上为美军担任空中警戒巡逻，创造174小时持续出动舰载机连续作战的记录。1945年3-4月，企业号参与了压制日本九州地区岸基航空兵和击沉超级战列舰大和号的作战行动。5月14日晨，一架日方神风飞机突然撞击企业号，前部升降机被击毁，死14人，伤34人，这是它在二战中最后一次受损伤，6月返回美国修理，在修理期间，日本宣布投降。二战结束后，企业号参加了胜利庆典活动，之后执行了运送海外军队返回美国的“魔毯”行动。从1946年1月18日起，停泊在新泽西州的Bayonne，从此未再出海。\n\n## 总体评价\n\n服役评价\n1938年12月21日，企业号舰长小牛顿·H·怀特上校离职，改由查尔斯·A·波纳尔上校担任，在此期间企业号的舰上工作效率始终都是海军数一数二的，波纳尔本人也因此获得船员们的好评。但是，外界对这艘航空母舰的看法却并非如此，当时，航母并没有受到像战后那么高的关注，和当时的战列舰相比，航母简直就像是穷酸的街头乞丐。在外人眼里，航母就是一个“盖着谷仓门的大浴缸“。人们嘲讽航母军官是“棕靴海军”（brown shoe Navy），由海军航空兵的鞋子颜色而得名，管普通水兵叫“平顶水手”（flattop sailors）。退役老兵西奥多·梅森过去是BB-44“加利福尼亚”号战列舰（USS California）的船员，曾参加过护送企业号驶往西海岸的行动，在他的回忆录《战列舰水兵》中这样写道：\n\n企业号在太平洋舰队中依旧保持了吃苦耐劳的优良作风，往来于圣迭戈与夏威夷之间的大海上。其经常超期执行巡航任务，这很大程度是因为“列克星敦”号、“萨拉托加”号和“约克城”号隔三差五地出故障，不停地回到船坞，以至于经常错过替岗时间。相比之下，企业号的工作就辛苦得多，在长达两年的时间里，她只放了几次“短假”，其中大部分是为了清除船底吸附的藤壶，还有一次是为了给电影《俯冲轰炸机》（Dive Bomber）拍外景。\n\n历史地位\n约克城级航空母舰在太平洋战争初期是美国海军的中流砥柱，是美国海军对抗日本联合舰队的重要力量，仅从中途岛战役而言，它们对太平洋战争的进程产生了不可估量的作用。\n\n二战太平洋战争期间，企业号九死一生，是整个二战中获得最多荣誉的战舰。1943年，当企业号回国进行大修和改进时，她获得了“总统部队嘉奖”（Presidential Unit Citation），这是第一艘荣获总统集体嘉奖的航空母舰，之后又获得了“海军部队嘉奖”（Navy Unit Commendation），成了二战期间美国唯一一艘同时荣获总统集体嘉奖和海军集体表彰的航母。在企业号服役的一生中，共航行442475公里，击沉敌舰71艘，击伤192艘，击落敌机911架，在美国海军中没有任何一艘军舰能与之相比，企业号象征着美国海军的战斗精神。1995年5月15日，美国国防部向企业号等追赠第16特遣舰队嘉奖。", "# 企业号航空母舰\n\n美国福特级航空母舰3号舰(CVN-80)\n\n企业号航空母舰，是美国在建的一艘航空母舰，是美国海军福特级航空母舰第三艘，2012年12月1日，CVN-65企业号航空母舰（USS Enterprise ）停役当天，美国海军正式宣布命名第三艘福特级航空母舰为CVN-80企业号（USS Enterprise ）。## 研制背景\n\n2012年12月1日，在美国弗吉尼亚州诺福克海军基地中，格林纳特上将告诉与会人员，由于海军部长雷·马伯斯当时正在中国进行访问而无法亲临典礼，因此只能通过电视屏幕转达部长的口信。电视屏幕中，马伯斯部长宣称第三艘福特级新一代核动力航空母舰CVN-80的舰名，将被命名为“企业”号，成为美国海军第九艘以此命名的舰艇。\n\n2017年2月1日，纽波特纽斯造船厂（NNS）获得一份2500万美元的预先计划修改合同，以支持企业号（CVN-80）的初步结构部件制造，它是福特级航母的三号舰。这个合同包含在车间开始制造结构部件、子部件和预组件，以支持企业号2018年3月的正式开工，这是福特级航母建造的重要一步。\n2016年5月23日，企业号（CVN-80）获得第一笔价值1.52亿美元的合同，包括工程、设计、规划和长期材料采购，建成后的企业号（CVN-80）将替换尼米兹级的二号舰艾森豪威尔号（CVN-69）。\n\n2017年8月24日下午，亨廷顿·英格尔斯工业公司（HII）在纽波特纽斯造船厂举行“福特”级航空母舰3号舰“企业”号（CVN-80）首块35吨重的钢板切割仪式，里约奥运会女子游泳冠军莱德基和女子体操冠军西蒙·拜尔斯在钢板上签下了自己的名字，标志着该航母已开工建造。\n\n## 技术特点\n\n### 设计特点\n\n自动化\n福特级是美国第一种利用计算机辅助工具（CAD）设计的航空母舰，应用了虚拟影像技术，在设计过程就能精确模拟每一个设计细节，并且预先解决相关的布局问题，对各部件实际制造的掌握精确度也大幅提高，此外也容许多组团队在同一时间分别进行设计开发，节约时间。乍看之下，福特级的布局似乎与尼米兹级大致相似，不过实际上仍做了相当多的改良。飞行甲板布局方面，如同前述，CVN-21在规划之初曾出现全新的构型，例如一个将降落区、起飞区分于舰身两侧的大胆构想；不过考量成本与风险后， 福特级仍以现役美国航空母舰的配置为基础进行改良。\n由于航空母舰与舰载机队的相关运作大幅改进，加上舰内的设备全面网络化与电脑化，福特级的整体自动化程度较尼米兹级大为增加，有效降低人力需求，故航空母舰操作人员将从尼米兹级的3190人减至2000人左右；减少的约1200名人力中，维持航空母舰本身运作的人员占了800名，其余400名是支援舰载机队的相关人员。此外，美国航空母舰新一代舰载机队机型种类也比以往降低许多， 故舰载机联队的人员编制也可能获得相当程度的缩减。由于人员减少，福特级的平均起居水平也有所增加，不仅每个人的空间更有隐私性，每一间住舱都有厕所。\n弹射器\n与现役美军航空母舰相同，福特级同样拥有四具弹射器，两具位于舰艏，另外两具位于斜角甲板；只不过一向被美国航空母舰采用的蒸汽弹射器， 在福特级上将被新Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System研发的电磁弹射器(Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System，EMALS)取代。传统蒸汽弹射器是将由反应炉制造的大量高压蒸汽储存于汽缸中，使用时用蒸汽推动牵引飞机的弹射梭，以270km的时速将飞机弹射升空；可想而知，蒸汽输送时将产生多少损耗，储存高压蒸汽的汽缸或者输送蒸汽的管线亦需颇大的空间，高压弹射系统中的活塞、管路与筏门等零件承受的损耗也十分惊人。现有C-13-2弹射器最常出现故障的部位是调节蒸汽压力的活门以及储存蒸汽的汽缸（两者都需要定期的预防性保养），此外弹射轨与牵引飞机鼻轮的梭车因高温摩擦而失火的情况也时有所闻。\n美国海军为福特级研发弹射器时，便不再走蒸汽弹射器的道路，而改发展革命性的EMALS。电磁弹射器的原理则是载流导线在磁场中受力，利用磁通量巨大的EMALS弹射F-35战斗机瞬间变化而产生的感应电磁斥力，将飞机弹射升空。电动马达的基本原理是在定子（stator）上通以方向不断改变的电流，利用电流改变造成的磁通量变化而产生磁场，进而使带有磁性的“转子”受力而产生运动。传统马达的定子采用环状排列，使得转子产生原地旋转运动；而电磁弹射器则采用两侧式线性感应马达（Double Sided Linear Induction Motor），定子分为两侧直线排列，充当弹射器的轨道，而转子则在两排定子之间进行直线运动，转子上头便连接了用于牵引飞机鼻轮的梭车（shuttle）。\n着舰回收\n除了弹射器外，福特级也将以先进飞机回收系统（AARS）来取代传统式的拦阻索。传统式拦阻索由拦截钢缆与液压缓冲Advanced Aircraft Recovery System机构成，以尼米兹级的MK-7 Mod3为例，能把一架降落速度130节（240km/hr）、重25吨的飞机在两秒之内于100m之内截停，共吸收64.4MJ的能量；不过这也接近这类系统的性能极限。在以往，美国海军舰载机的武装以廉价无导引武器为主，如果在任务中没有用完，降落前大可将其抛海以减少降落时的重量与风险；然而，现美国舰载机主要都配备精密昂贵的导引武器，如果没有用完就必须携回。因此，美国航空母舰上的拦截回收系统的能耐必须强化，才能有效拦住返航重量日益提高的舰载机。\n甲板布局\n与尼米兹级相较，福特级在飞行甲板布局方面最主要的改良，在于改进了油料与弹药补给的动线。后期型尼米兹级拥有三具甲板弹药升降机，分别位于前方弹射器中央、右舷两座靠前方的飞机升降机之间，以及舰岛旁边；进行弹药补给作业时，舰上人员必须先透过弹舱升降机，将武器从水线以下的弹药库（分置于数层舰底甲板）往上送至03甲板（即下甲板机库的再下一层），然后借用位于03甲板的舰上餐厅餐厅空间，在餐桌上完成武器的组装设定，接着透过输送车将弹药运至甲板弹药升降机部位，才能送上飞行甲板。\n尼米兹级将甲板弹药升降机设在飞行甲板中间是因为配合弹药库的位置，这使得在透过弹药升降机将武器送上甲板时，所有的飞行起降作业都必须暂停。此外，武器送上甲板后，还需透过甲板运输车个别地送到每一架需要挂弹的飞机位置；相似地，飞机的加油作业也是透过穿梭在甲板各处的加油车直接开到需要补给的飞机旁进行。总而言之，每次尼米兹级的机队进行加油挂弹作业，总共需耗费2小时左右。\n\n### 动力系统\n\n动力方面，鉴于电力系统在分配管理上十分便利，福特级引进整合电力系统（IPS）的概念，尽可能地以电力的系统取代原先航空母舰上的蒸汽次系统，举凡电磁弹射器、回收系统、升降机、烹饪、热水供应、洗衣、暖气等，而各式侦测、作战、指管通情设施不消说自然也是电力在驱动，因此福特级的动力系统必须提供远高于现役航空母舰的电力，并需配备更全面而完善的电力供应设施。反应堆部分，长年为美国海军核能航空母舰提供反应堆的西屋（Westhouse）公司提出新的A5W反应堆方案，然而在1999年的竞标中，西屋败给了属于美国政府、位于宾夕法尼亚州的贝蒂斯核子动力实验室（Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory），因此福特级的反应堆便称A1B（B代表贝蒂斯）。福特级将配备两具A1B反应器。A1B反应堆，功率较尼米兹级增加25%以上，配备13500V输配电系统，供电能力则高达20万千瓦，几乎是尼米兹级（6万4000千瓦）的三倍，能充分供给EMALS所需的电力；也由于充裕的电力，福特级成为第一种所有机房都设有冷气空调的舰艇，能增加操作人员的舒适性，并降低机房内设备的维修保养需求。此外，A1B的炉心将拥有50年的使用寿命，使福特级在大部分的役期中都无须为了更换炉心而回到船坞大动手术，增加了寿命周期内的服勤时间。除了新反应炉外，福特级也会使用全新的整体轮机系统以及配电系统，电力的整合、分配架构也将重新规划，例如在全舰各处设置分区供电系统，并设置一个电脑控制配电系统，使电力的分配合理化。最初福特级甚至打算连推进系统 也采用电力推进，亦即以反应炉发出的电力驱动由电动马达带动的推进器（例如可转式囊荚推进器），然而由于足供10万吨级舰艇使用的电力推进系统 尚未发展成熟，因此前三艘福特级仍将以蒸汽涡轮直接驱动四轴螺旋桨推进，作为推进的功率将达到104MW（约280000 马力），略高于尼米兹级。\n\n### 舰电系统\n\n福特级大量采用先进的侦测、电子战系统以及C4I设备（包括CEC协同接战能力），以符合美国海军未来IT-21联网作战的要求，舰上的指挥管制中枢将是CommonC2System共同作战指挥系统，能整合舰上一切指管通情与武器射控功能。舰上各型相控阵雷达、卫星通讯、资料传输链、电子战系统与联合精确进场暨降落系统的天线整合于舰桥结构内，或置于舰桥顶部的轻量化桅杆上。舰上的作战与指管通情系统将采用开放式的架构，大量使用民间商规组建，以利于服役生涯中的维护与升级作业；而舰上的整合通信系统则由Avaya公司提供。福特级的轻量化桅杆由复合材料制造，强度与钢铁相仿，但重量便显著地降低。在规划阶段，福特级最主要的侦测系统，是与朱姆沃尔特级驱逐舰相同的双频雷达系统(Dual Band Radar，DBR)，包括AN/SPY-3 I/J频带多功能雷达(Multi Fuction Radar，MFR)，以及AN/SPY-4 S长程广域搜索雷达（Volume Search Radar，VSR），两者都是最先进的数位波形控制主动相控阵雷达。\n不过在2010年6月，美国海军宣布DDG-1000取消VSR雷达，未来可能以更晚开发、增加反弹道导弹能力的AMDR相控阵雷达来取代，因此福特级也可能会以AMDR来取代DBR系统。以往美国航空母舰的舰岛都拥有两层舰桥，分别供舰长以及航空母舰战斗群指挥官使用；而福特级的舰岛仅设置一层宽广的主舰桥，并在主舰桥靠近舰岛左侧的上方与下方，各设置一层小型舰桥，上方应为舰载机管制室，下方则用于监视飞行甲板运作。这种较为紧致的空间配置，似乎是基于美国海军长年累积的操作经验，或者是降低雷达截面积等。自卫武装方面， 根据模型的照片，第一批福特级的防卫武器包括MK-15 Block 1B密集阵近程防御武器系统、RAM公羊短程防空导弹发射器、MK-29海麻雀防空导弹发射器（照明射控工作由SPY-3相控阵雷达负责）等，安装于两舷和舰尾外侧的平台上；此外根据想象图，福特级还打算舰尾左侧的舷外平台上安装MK-41垂直发射系统，装填海麻雀ESSM短程防空导弹，不过实际情况仍有待最后确认。未来福特级的武器系统可能会朝向电磁炮甚至直接能量的激光炮的方向发展，而福特级舰上极高的“电力化”程度将为这类高能武器的发展提供良好的先决条件。\n\n##

研制背景\n\n1945年，二战结束后，美国为了继续保持海军优势以实现其全球战略目标，采取了两项措施，一是淘汰一批舰龄长、吨位小、性能差的航母，封存或报废大部分战列舰；二是着手设计和建造一批载机多、性能好、适应现代海战需要的超大型航母，并于20世纪50年代相继建成了“福莱斯特”号、“萨拉托加”号、“突击者”号和“独立”号等大型航母。但由于飞机尺寸、重量和速度的增加以及引进燃料耗量极大的喷气推进，对航空母舰提出了更高的要求。尽管福莱斯特级航空母舰和小鹰级航空母舰在舰型、装备布置和排水量上比二战期间的航母要先进得多，但是仍远不能适应舰载机的需要。\n1950年，经美国“核潜艇之父”里科弗多方游说，美海军作战部长福雷斯特·谢尔曼认为美国不仅需要核潜艇，还需要“探讨“建造一艘具有核动力装置的大型航空母舰的可能性。1952年1月，美国完成了航空母舰核反应堆的选型研究。但此时谢尔曼去世，核动力航母的建造失去了有力的支持，加之反对派呼声日盛，研制工作暂时搁浅。1954年9月30日，美国第一艘核潜艇“鹦鹉螺”号正式服役的消息轰动全球，再度引起人们对建造核动力水面舰艇的注目。1956年1月，美国海军正式发文，开始核动力航母的初步设计。1957年12月，世界上第一艘核动力水面舰艇长滩号巡洋舰正式开工建造，1957年8月，苏联宣布发射成功了一枚洲际导弹。为了表明对苏联的军事优势，美国海军决定将核动力航空母舰列入1958年造舰计划。当时，里科弗保证，其所设计的核动力航母只需安装2个反应堆，造价可相对减少。\n\n### 建造沿革\n\n企业号航空母舰是美军第八艘以“Enterprise”命名的军舰，舰名源自美国独立战争期间美军俘获并更名的一艘英国单桅纵帆船。企业号的前任，是约克城级航空母舰的第2艘，第7艘以企业号命名的CV-6“企业”号，于1934年7月开工，1936年10月下水，1938年5月在东海岸开始服役，1939年4月转入太平洋。CV-6“企业”号是二战中的功勋舰艇，几乎参加了除珊瑚海以外的所有太平洋战役，多次受到美英海军的嘉奖。1947年，CV-6“企业”号退役，1958年拆解。“企业”号保存协会”与美国海军达成协议，将筹划中的第一艘核动力航母命名为新“企业”号，CVN-65“企业”号因此得名。\n1958财年，美国批准了企业号航空母舰的建造，预算造价4.5亿美元，1958年2月4日，在纽波特纽斯造船及船坞公司开工，1960年9月24日下水交付，由时任美国海军部长威廉·法兰克（William B.Franke）夫人掷瓶，1960年9月25日开始舾装，1961年10月进行海试。企业号首次装填核燃料和更换核燃料分别耗资6400万美元和2000万美元，最近的一次改装工程按1990财年拨款为14亿美元。\n\n### 服役历程\n\n1961年11月25日，企业号正式服役并在次月编入美国大西洋舰队，舷号CVN-65。1962年1月12日执行处女航同时也是为期三个月的试验航行。企业号服役期间一直部署在太平洋舰队，经常参加海上活动，但实战较少。在役51年，企业号参与过越南战争、伊战、阿战，以及海湾地区多场战事和波黑战争，获得数十枚军事奖章\n\n2012年12月1日，在美国弗吉尼亚州，企业号航母盛装满旗，舰上的甲板上、平台上围着蓝白红三色的布幔，形状独特的四方形舰岛上有着被电灯围绕的白色65号字样，数字的上方则用黄色、黑色、绿色、红色以及蓝色等颜色标记这各种这艘舰艇获得的勋赏代号。在经历了51年的服役生涯后，企业号完成了它的使命，美国海军在其机库举行了退役仪式，数千名曾在企业号上服役的水手、老兵、造船厂工人及其家属出席了当天的退役仪式，大西洋舰队航空兵司令向企业号的最后一任舰长颁发集体表彰奖。在纪念会和退役仪式上，有这样一句话“WE ARE LEGEND（我们是传奇）”。随后时任美国海军部长Raymond Mabus通过先行录制的影片宣布CVN-80福特级航空母舰（USSEnterprise）将袭用企业号的传奇舰名，计划于2027年服役。\n2013年6月20日，企业号正式退役仪式后，由拖船拖离诺福克海军基地，同日抵达纽波特纽斯造船厂，接着开始拆解工作，预计拆除放射性燃料棒和反应堆将耗费3年时间和数千万美元。企业号先安全地拆除反应堆燃料棒，然后由拖船向南拖行，绕过南美洲大陆最南端合恩角，最终抵达华盛顿州皮吉特湾。在那里海军工程师拆除了企业号的8座反应堆，由于拆除核反应堆需要大面积切割飞行甲板，因此企业号无法保留作博物馆舰，只能保留舰岛，最终企业号船体被拆解成总重9万吨的金属碎片。\n\n## 技术特点\n\n### 舰型结构\n\n舰型\n企业号航母具有完善的航空支援能力，舰体与小鹰级航空母舰基本相同，采用了封闭式斜角飞行甲板，斜角甲板为10.5°，岛形上层建筑位于舰舯部右舷后方；非传统箱形舰桥和窄小的支撑底座结构，方形对空搜索雷达位于岛形上层建筑顶部前方；防空导弹发射装置分别位于飞行甲板末端和舰首右舷，舰空导弹发射装置安装在左舷斜角甲板前方以及右舷斜角甲板边缘后方，近程防御系统安装在飞行甲板尾部下方以及左舷斜角甲板前方的舷侧突出部。此外，它的航空支援能力及结构方面也有不少独到之处，舰上取消了常规动力所需的粗大而笨重的进气管道和烟囱，有着较大的甲板空间，以增加舰载机数量并能提高飞机起降时的安全性。企业号航母岛式建筑与美国其它航空母舰大同小异的舰岛相比显得非常特别，它的飞行甲板上伫立着一座方方正正的舰岛，显得较弧立，号称“65号大厦”，方正舰岛主要是为了配合雷达的安装，舰岛后侧无尼米兹级和小鹰级的网格状天线支架，其它布局同尼米兹级。\n结构\n企业号航母由于不再使用燃油作为主机的能源，舰员不会受到烟囱排放的影响，舰内也听不到蒸汽锅炉鼓风机那恼人的噪声。此外，由于核动力装置功率大，故企业号舱室的空调效果好居室宽敞舒适且设有海水淡化装置，使用淡水几乎不受限制。企业号舰桥中下部是方柱形，圆锥形的上部顶端有十字架式主桅。整个上层建筑大致可分为7层，第1至第5层为高级军官舱、电子设备区和维护保养区，第6层为舰长舰桥，第7层是观察平台和信号舰桥在飞行甲板以下约可分为11层，向下第1层是下级军官集会室、舰长休息室、高级军官休息室以及军官特等舱；第2层为战斗情报中心和空战指挥中心、各种辅助舱、舰员住舱和修理设备间等;第3层设有各种办公室、修理间、电池间、理发间和小卖部等，第4层为机库甲板；第5层设有医院、军官特等舱、和飞行员预备舱等;第6层设有住舱、机械间、军士长厨房及餐厅、电工间、油舱、弹药舱、配电板和辅机舱等；第7至第10层为主机舱和反应堆舱；第11层为内底水舱和油舱，整个舰体内部由1000多个舱室组成。\n\n甲板\n企业号航母从舰底至飞行甲板形成整体箱形结构，甲板上分别设有4部长90米的C-13-1蒸汽弹射器蒸汽弹射器，2个在轴向甲板，2个在斜角甲板，斜角甲板后端设飞机着舰阻拦装置。该舰的拦机装置由阻拦索和阻拦网两部分组成。四条MK-7拦截索，直径6.35厘米、高度50厘米、相互间隔约14米，并列布置4根，可以拉住重30吨、以140千米时速进场的飞机；阻拦网由尼龙带制成，平时堆放在斜角甲板端部左舷当载机需要着舰时，架设到拦机网支柱上，架设时间约需2分钟。\n企业号舰上设有4部镁铝合金制造的舷侧升降机，左舷1部，右舷3部，每部升降机长23.5米、宽16米、面积374平方米、自重105吨、提升力40.4吨，每部升降机一次可装载两架飞机，运行一次只需25秒。舰上机库为全封闭式，长223.1米，高7.26米，面积约20070平方米。飞行甲板为强力甲板，厚达50毫米，在关键部位加装装甲，水下部分的舷侧装甲厚达150毫米，并设有多层防雷隔舱。可携载11000吨航空燃油，可供航空联队使用12天。\n\n### 动力系统\n\n企业号航母最闻名遐迩之处就在于它的核动力装置性能优异，为了让企业号能达到30节航速，所以全舰采用8座西屋公司生产的A2W压水反应堆，驱动4台通用电气公司的各为7500马力（52兆瓦）的蒸汽轮机和32个热交换器，4轴4桨，每两座并联驱动一个螺旋桨，螺旋桨直径6.4米，重29吨，动力装置总功率为28万马力（209兆瓦），航速33~35节。但如此设计十分浪费空间，导致企业号舰身中段几乎被轮机设备占满。当时第一代的舰载反应堆A2W技术不成熟，只能输出35000轴马力，全舰总发电量为20000千瓦，此外还备有4台应急柴油辅助发电机，功率为30000马力。\n企业号航母由于采取核动力推进，续航能力强，在20节航速时，续航力400000海里，相当于绕地球13圈，核动力使美军航母舰队全速航行得到了解决。截止到2007年，企业号已更换3次燃料，更换一次核燃料可航行20万-50万海里，累计航程超过100万海里。第一次更换燃料是在服役3年后，此间该舰航行207000海里，并于1964年进行了总航程30000海里的无补给环球航行。\n\n### 武器配置\n\n主要武器\n企业号航母的最大可搭载各型飞机84架，分别是20架F-14战斗机；36架F/A-18战斗攻击机，组成三个中队，包括一中队的F/A-18战斗攻击机E/F型；4/5架EA-6B电子战飞机，后使用4架EA-18G电子战飞机代替；4/5架E-2C预警机；8-10架S-3A/B反潜机；4架SH-60舰载直升机和2架HH-60铺路鹰直升机，或者6架SH-3G/H直升机或SH-60F“大洋鹰”直升机；2架C-2A“灰狗”运输机；20架A-6E“入侵者”加油机（含KA-6D），后由F/A-18取代。1973年企业号进行了在越战中的最后一次空袭行动后，开始更换舰载机，以F-14A、S-3等取代原有的F-4等。\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| F-14战斗机绰号“雄猫”（Tomcat），根据美国海军20世纪70年代至80年代舰队防空和护航的要求，由格鲁曼公司（现诺思罗普·格鲁曼公司）研制的双座超音速多用途重型舰载战斗机，用来替换海军的F-4战斗机。主要执行舰队防御、截击、打击和侦察等任务。F-14在世代上属于第三代战斗机，于1967年底开始研制，1970年12月21日原型机首飞，1972年5月交付使用。1987年，装备改进型发动机的F-14B正式投产。1988年，该机在雷达、航空电子设备和导弹挂载能力等方面经过了进一步改进升级，并定名为F-14D“超级雄猫”，2006年7月28日退役。 |  |\n| F/A-18战斗机绰号“大黄蜂”（HORNET STRIKE FIGHTER），美国格鲁曼公司为美海军研制的舰载单座双发超音速多用途第四代战斗/攻击机（国际第四代战斗机标准），它也是美国军方第一种兼具战斗机与攻击机身份的型号。基于这个原因，作为美国海军最重要的舰载机，F-18的用途广泛，它既可用于海上防空，也可进行对地攻击。该机于1978年首飞，1983年进入美国海军服役，F-14战斗机退役后，一段时间内F-18成为美国航空母舰上仅有的舰载战斗机，C为单座D则为双座。 |  |\n| F/A-18E/F战斗机绰号“超级大黄蜂式”（Super Hornet），是最新改型的多任务战斗攻击机，由F-18C/D发展而来，E型为单座，F型双座。其主要特点是增大了航程、机翼处增加1个外挂架，而且机翼内侧挂架的最大挂载能力提高到2400kg，增加了载弹量和提高了作战能力；采用了隐身外形设计，包括原来的椭圆形进气道改为矩形进气道，涂漆含有吸收雷达辐射的材料。前机身延长0.86米，翼展加宽1.31米，机翼翼面增大9.29平方米，因此翼载减小；水平尾翼也有所增大，后掠角减小；机翼前缘边条面积增大了34%。 |  |\n| EA-18G电子战飞机绰号“咆哮者”（Boeing EA-18G Growler），波音公司在美国海军F/A-18E/F战斗机的基础之上发展研制而成，用以替代EA-6B电子战飞机（绰号“徘徊者”）。它不仅拥有新一代电子对抗设备，同时还保留了F/A-18E/F全部武器系统和优异的机动性能，先进的设计使得其无论在航空母舰的飞行甲板上还是在陆地上都能较好地执行机载电子攻击（AEA）任务。专家们评价说，“咆哮者”既是当今战斗力最强的电子干扰机，又是电子干扰能力最强的战斗机。 |  |\n| E-2预警机绰号“鹰眼”（E-2 Hawk eye），美国格鲁曼公司在20世纪50年代末期研制的舰载空中早期预警与航空管制机，是美国海军现使用的舰载空中预警机。E-2同时也被许多国家空军在陆上机场使用，它是全世界产量最大，运营方最多的预警机，包括法国、新加坡、日本、以色列、中国（台湾）等均购买并投入使用，E-2C为最新改进型。 |  |\n| S-3反潜机绰号“北欧海盗”（Viking），1972年美国洛克希德公司为美国海军研制的一款兼具海上巡逻、反潜战和空中加油等功能的飞机。S-3是针对当时的苏联核潜艇而研制的反潜机，为全世界首型喷气反潜机，为了要长时间在海上搜索潜艇而要采用低耗油量的通用动力TF34-GE-24涡轮风扇发动机，在机尾也有长长的磁异探侧器去帮助搜寻潜艇。美国海军用它来取代S-2反潜机，以配合P-3岸基反潜机使用，S-3A/B为最新型号。 |  |\n| C-2A“灰狗”运输机C-2A是由E-2A预警机发展而来的，专门用于为航空母舰舰载机运输货物。它与CVS-10和CVA-19航空母舰上的升降机和甲板机库相匹配，可用弹射装置起飞（采用机头牵引方式），也可拦阻降落。C-2A的许多部件与E-2A可以通用，具有相似的全天候能力。共计生产3架预生产型飞机，一架用于静力试验。于1964年11月18日首次飞行，1964年12月2日正式交付海军。生产型飞机从1966年开始交付美国海军舰上运输部队，作为C-1飞机的补充。 |  |\n| SH-3反潜直升机绰号“海王”（Sea King），是西科斯基公司研制的双发中型反潜多用途直升机，在开发初期，其军用代号为HSS-2，公司代号为S-61。应美国海军1957年新兵器系统中反潜直升机项目要求，SH-3具有全天候作战能力，可载2名声呐员，携带声纳设备、深水炸弹和可制导鱼雷等共计380千克的装备品，做4小时以上的海上搜潜攻潜作业。采用双发单旋翼带尾桨布局，尾桨装在尾斜梁左侧。采用全金半硬壳式船形机腹结构，机身两侧有短翼，翼梢有浮筒。机身尾段可以折叠，从而减少了停放空间，机身侧面设有大型舱门。 |  |\n| SH-60舰载直升机绰号“海鹰”（Sea Hawk），是美国海军装备广泛的双发、单桨多用途直升机，而且型号特别多，有SH-60B“海鹰”、SH-60F“大洋鹰”、HH-60H、VH-60A、SH-60R、CH-60等。美国海岸警卫队还装备有HH-60J“坚鹰”。MH-60R是美国海军在现有的SH-60R基础上进行改造而来的一种多任务机种，用于取代SH-60B和SH-60F。最开始MH-60R被命名为“战斗鹰”（Strikehawk），但是最终被改为海鹰。\n\n|  |\n\n防御武器\n自卫武装方面，企业号原本预定要比照小鹰级，装置两套配合小猎犬防空导弹系统的MK-10导弹发射器（设置在舰尾），但由于企业号的建造成本高昂且严重超支，为了节约经费，服役初期没有任何自卫武装。1960年代中期，美国海军认为航空母舰不需要区域防空飞弹系统，于是企业号便在1967年加装两座MK-25 BPDMS。企业号航空母舰最初加装了原本不在预算中的RIM-2防空导弹（小猎犬），之后升级成3座MK15密集阵6管20毫米近防速射炮和3座八联装MK29“海麻雀”舰空导弹发射装置。2000年再次升级时，前向的密集阵近防速射炮又被换成两座RIM-116防空导弹。企业号在1979年至1982年接受现代化改装工程，将BPDMS换成更新一代的改良型点防御防空飞弹系统（IPDMS），以轻量化的MK-29海麻雀发射器取代原本笨重的MK-25。加装导控海麻雀飞弹的MK-91射控雷达以及三座MK-15 CIWS，并以SPS-48与SPS-49对空搜索雷达取代原有的SPS-32/33对空搜索雷达；此外，也进行了第三次核燃料棒更换工程。1992年企业号再度进行改良，追加一座MK-29，SPS-48C升级为SPS-48E，并加装MK-23TAS（包含一座加装在右舷后部舷外的AN/SPQ-9A追踪雷达）、NTDS升级、ASCAC、TFCC以及SYS-2（V）4 IADT。在2000年代，企业号加装两组MK-31 Block1公羊（RAM）短程反导弹系统，海麻雀与方阵系统则减为各两组。\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| MK29防空导弹绰号“海麻雀”（Sea Sparrow），美国雷神公司（Raytheon）研制的中程雷达制导防空导弹，发射Mk57对空导弹，由AIM-7“麻雀”（Sparrow）系列导弹发展而来。研制开始于1946年，是一种全天候近程、低空舰载防空导弹武器系统，主要用于对付低空飞机、直升机及反舰导弹，1969年开始装备。海麻雀经过改进后具备命中精度高、反应时间短、抗干扰能力强、适用范围广、全天候、全方位、多目标攻击能力等优点。 |  |\n| RIM-116防空导弹RIM-116是一种以红外线与被动雷达整合导引的轻型，点防御舰对空导弹，使用于美国、德国、韩国等国家的军舰上，用来拦截巡弋飞行型态的反舰导弹与其他具有威胁性的飞行器。因为导弹在飞行时弹体会不断滚转，所以该型导弹也被命名为“滚体导弹”（Rolling Aireframe Missile，简称RAM），负责发射滚体导弹的MK49型发射器安装重量达5777千克，并可放置21枚拉姆导弹。 |  |\n| MK15密集阵近防速射炮绰号“火神密集阵”（Vulcan Phalanx），美国海军为解决军舰近程防空问题专门设计制造的6管20毫米口径自动旋转式火炮系统，由美国通用动力公司生产（GE、GD），发射率3000发/分（改进型4500发/分），射程1500米（改进型1829米），密集阵系统是美国海军舰只的最后屏障，它能有效的打击从其他防空系统漏掉的反舰导弹\n。 |  |\n\n### 舰电系统\n\n雷达\n企业号航母为了配合相控阵雷达，设置了独特的结构紧凑的方形舰岛，在舰岛的各面都能安装平面列阵雷达的扁形天线，在舰桥圆形涡纹建筑的顶部装固定天线，这种舰岛也成为新式航空母舰的设计基调。企业号搭载有当时最先进的相控阵雷达技术，相控阵雷达能比传统旋转式雷达追踪更多空中目标，一个圆形天线阵和4个平面天线阵能有效探测360º范围。\n企业号早期装有四面SPS-32/33 3D频率相控阵雷达的平板式固定天线，前后左右各一面，而舰桥顶上则有一个造型相当特殊的圆锥状结构，装有电子战设施。不过上述电子系统都不容易维修，因此在1979至1982年的改装工程中，这些都被拆除了，改换SPS-48C3D雷达。后期又加装有电子计算机数据处理系统．该系统整理和处理来自本舰雷达、护航舰只、飞机以及其它来源的信息，并将其自动传给其它舰只，使整个特混舰队象一艘军舰那样协调一致地行动。这一系统能使特混舰队指挥官迅速分析多种威胁的轻重缓急。采取措施防御最危险的袭击。战术通讯导航系统是保障空中作战的重要电子设备，它利用信标向飞机传递距离和方位，大大简化了飞机在执行任务后寻找母舰的过程。\n\n对抗\n企业号装有4座洛拉尔·海柯尔（Loral Hycor）Mk36 SRBOC6管红外曳光弹和干扰箔条弹发射器，射程2.2海里；SLQ36“水精”（Nixie）水声干扰器；AN/SLQ-32（V）4型告警，干扰和欺骗系统作战数据系统。\n综合\n企业号装有NTKS海军战术数据库系统，海军战术和先进战斗指挥系统（ACDS 0型）；SPS-64（V）导航系统，SPN-41、42A（2部）、43A、44、46飞机进场控制；4A，11，14，16号数据链；将安装JMCIS；另有JOTS，POST，CVIC，TESS UMM-1（V）1，SSQ-82；卫星通信系统（SATCOMS）SRR-1，WSC-3（UHF），WSC-6（SHF），USC-38（EHF）；URN-25塔康导航设备；水面舰艇鱼雷防御系统（SSTDS）\n\n。\n\n## 性能数据\n\n##

总体评价\n\n服役评价\n企业号航母是美国及世界第一艘核动力航空母舰，为企业级航母的首艘，是在福莱斯特级航母和小鹰级航母的基础上发展改进而成，其设计思想对美国第二代核动力航空母舰尼米兹级有着重要的影响。美国海军原计划建造6艘企业级航空母舰，但因为当时核动力技术不成熟，核心系统的成本昂贵导致造价超过预期，军方被迫取消剩余的订单，转而建造传统动力的小鹰级航母以替补缺额。在这样的发展背景下，企业号航空母舰意外地成为一个孤立的舰级。\n企业号航母是美国海军仅有的一艘具有8座核反应堆舰船，这还是经过精简化的构造，在原先的反应堆设计案中，还预留了一座传统动力锅炉的安装空间，但没有实现。企业号也是仅有的一艘配置有四片方向舵的航空母舰，美军其他航空母舰都只有配置两片方向舵。企业号还拥有罕见的、类似于巡洋舰的高速船壳设计，除了革命性地首度采用了核动力推进方式之外，还搭载有当时最先进的相控阵雷达技术，比传统旋转式雷达追踪更多空中目标，企业号为了配合相控阵雷达的安装因而拥有独特的方形舰桥，这也成为以后新式航空母舰舰桥的设计基调。\n企业号航母的服役经历虽然不及它前辈CV-6的功勋，但也无愧于“传奇”二字。从服役初期1962年封锁古巴起，先后经历1964年首支全核舰队无补给环球航行“海轨行动”、1965年参加越战“扬基站”执勤“滚雷行动”、1969年严重事故、1975年“频繁之风”、1988年二战后美国最大规模的海上交战“螳螂行动”、1989年协助菲律宾平定军人叛乱、1996年波黑、伊拉克禁飞区巡逻的“联合努力”和“南方守望”行动、1998年“沙漠之狐”、2001年“持久自由”、2003年“伊拉克自由”，遗憾可能就是因换料大修而错过了海湾战争。服役了51年的企业号也创下了美国航母服役期之最，它为维护美国全球利益频繁出击，多次参与地区性冲突和作战行动，立下了汗马功劳\n\n。\n装备轶事\n企业号航母在其服役的51年间，很多传奇的故事以及一系列辉煌的数据。企业号由900名船厂工程师和设计师制作了建造草图，设计草稿图有3862425.6米，比从迈阿密到洛杉矶还要远。它由60923吨钢铁铸成，钢材用量比帝国大厦还多，1507吨金属铝，370千米的管线，1700吨焊条，这些材料由超过800家公司提供。它全长342.3米，是美国海军最大的一艘船舰，有4个橄榄球场长，一共使用了8座核反应堆，一次可以运载90架飞机。企业号一共航行了超过100万海里，而这可以绕地球40圈，已经运载了超过10万名海员和飞行员，甲板经受了400000次以上飞机拦阻降落，服役期间美国历经了10位总统。1986年9月16日，汤姆克鲁斯主演的美国电影《壮志凌云》曾在企业号航母的甲板上拍摄。1990年，曾参与拍摄电影《猎杀红色十月》。科幻影视《星际迷航》中柯克船长所用航天飞机，创作灵感来自企业号。\n企业号航母更换一次核燃料可航行50万海里，在51年的服役生涯中企业号有过数次更换核燃料：在航行了20.7万海里之后，于1964年11月第一次更换；又航行了30万海里之后，于1969年10月第二次更换；在航行了50万海里之后，于1979年第一次现代化改装中第三次更换，经过长达38个月；1982年重新服役在1991年实行延长服役期现代化改装计划时，第四次更换核燃料，经过长达3年多的工程，1995年年中重新投入使用。"],

{"name": "河姆渡文化", "documents": ["河姆渡文化，是指中国长江流域下游以南宁波地区古老而多姿的新石器时代文化  。黑陶是河姆渡陶器的一大特色；在建筑方面，遗址中发现大量\"干栏式房屋\"的遗迹。\n1973年，发现于浙江宁波的河姆渡镇，因而命名。它主要分布在宁波及舟山群岛  。经科学的方法进行测定，它的年代为公元前5000年至公元前3300年（距今约7021~5021年）。它是新石器时代母系氏族公社时期的氏族村落遗址，反映了距今约7000年前长江下游流域氏族的情况。\n中国上古时代传说中的“有巢氏”部落就是居住在宁波的河姆渡人的一支。有巢氏是中国古代传说中”构木为巢“的巢居发明者；而这正是对河姆渡人”干栏式房屋“的映射与形容。\n有巢氏，尊号”巢皇“、”大巢氏“，中国上古时期部落首领，相传为燧人氏之父、伏羲氏与女娲氏的祖父。曾率领其部落人民以宁波为起点两度迁徙；先后到达今浙江杭嘉湖平原与今安徽巢湖流域，并在良渚古城登基成为了良渚古国的最后一代君主；后期又在今山东琅琊古城（位于今山东省青岛市黄岛区）建立了陪都。而后又在今巢湖一带建立了古巢国，定都凌家滩古城（今安徽凌家滩遗址）。\n\n河姆渡文化因有巢氏先民的迁徙而加速与外界文化的融合与发展，与浙江良渚文化、安徽凌家滩文化广泛交融；共同构成了有巢氏先民赖以生存的社会文化背景。\n\n## 考古发现\n\n河姆渡遗址是世界著名的新石器时代遗址，它代表着长江流域及其以南地区的东南江海文化的先驱；与其对应的是以西安附近半坡村遗址为代表的黄河流域及其以北地区的中原内陆文化，从而构成了中国文化源流的两大区史系统。\n\n河姆渡遗址最早在1973年被发现，位于宁波市河姆渡镇河姆渡村东北部，在1973~1974和1977~1978年两次对河姆渡遗址作发掘并有资料。黑陶是河姆渡陶器的一大特色。在建筑方面，遗址中发现大量干栏式建筑的遗迹。\n相传中国上古部落首领“有巢氏”便是隶属于宁波地区的河姆渡人的一支，是河姆渡人的一员。\n有巢氏，尊号“巢皇”、“大巢氏”，中国上古时代部落首领；前4964~前4464年在位。中国古代神话传说中构木为巢的发明者；相传为燧人氏之父、伏羲与女娲的祖父；是良渚古国的末代君主以及古巢国开国君主。而河姆渡文化也是有巢氏执政早期的文化。河姆渡文化与良渚文化、凌家滩文化有着一定程度上的传承关系。\n1973年在河姆渡遗址第一期发掘中，木构建筑露头于第四层中部，出土的木构件总数达1000件以上。主要构件是13排木桩，基本上形成西北至东南走向，部分近正南北。这里至少建筑着三栋以上的房屋。这些房屋呈长条状，系多间互相品连而成，其中有一栋连品的房屋在九间以上。\n在七千年前，这样大规模的建筑群，正与《韩非子》所说的：“有作构木为巢，以之群居。”相吻合。\n由于河姆渡遗址地处江滨，近沼泽与水，地势低湿。为此，筑房屋时先打下四排木椿，造成离地面相当高的底 架，在底架上架地梁，在上面建设地板；再在上面立柱、架梁、敷椽、覆盖茅茨。在底架下面圈养家畜，上面住人。\n这种以木椿为基础，在其上架设大、小梁承托地板，构成架空的建筑基座，再于其上立柱架梁干栏式木构房屋， 是原始巢居的直接继承和发展。\n其梁柱的交结点用桦卯结构，是中国已发现木结构建筑中最早采用的技术。这就是《路史·前纪》所谓的“登巢琢鑫”和“构木为巢”的真正含义。所以，今天的河渡地区是当时有巢氏国的中心区域。\n1994年4月至7月中句，在河姆渡鲞架山进行考古发掘时，发现了河姆渡先民的瓮罐葬和红烧土祭祀碑，其中一处遗址直径达340厘米，最厚处达7.05厘米。\n从出土文物迹像分析：先民死后尸体用火烧后，将遗骨放入罐内，再入土安葬， 带有“古代火葬” 的形式，这是迄今国内发掘的古遗址中所罕见。却与《路史》有巢氏条：“民之葬者……于厚衣之薪（焚），而葬之，不封不植也。掩孤而已。” 的记载相一致。至今嘉兴、湖州、桐乡一带的丧葬习俗，还依然如此。\n河姆渡人是越族先民，他们是百越民族的远祖。有学者认为河姆渡人与传说中的羽民国有关，这种见解有一定理由。\n《淮南子·坠形训》中有羽民国的记载。《 山海经·大荒南经》 说：“羽民之国，其民皆生毛羽。”\n羽饰的习俗，与河姆渡地区为候鸟集中地有关。大雁等候鸟在这里换毛后，留下了大量的羽毛。越族先民将长大美丽的羽毛作为头饰。在河姆渡遗址第三文化层中发现一些陶塑人头，其中几个头部有横向一列的五个小孔，是用来插羽毛的。但更多的候鸟羽毛，用来塞在粗疏的植物纤维纺织品夹层内，作冬天御寒之用。\n正如有巢氏条所载：“木皮未委，于复塞其羽革，紩衣挛领，着兜冒（帽 ）以贲体。”\n“木皮”就是指藤本植物的纤维，河姆渡人的纺轮，将它纺成纱。又织成极其粗疏的布，做成衣服。但它的御寒性能极差，须要在夹层中铺塞羽毛或皮革。由于布粗空隙大，大量细羽毛从布中穿出，使外地人看到后，有全身“皆生毛羽”的感觉，故被称之为“羽民”；其地被称为“羽民之国” 。\n河姆渡人因居被称有巢氏之民，冬天外出则被称为羽民，而羽饰则是越族先民的一种习俗。当有巢氏失国多年之后，羽人国的别称依然存在，不过“羽人”已缓读为“于越”人了。\n\n河姆渡文化的骨器制作比较进步，有耜、鱼镖、镞、哨、匕、锥、锯形器等器物，精心磨制而成，一些有柄骨匕、骨笄上雕刻花纹或双头连体鸟纹图案，就像是精美绝伦的实用工艺品。在众多的出土文物中，最重要的是发现了大量人工栽培的稻谷，这是目 前世界上最古老、最丰富的稻作文化遗址。它的发现，改变了中国栽培水稻从印度引进的传统传说。\n\n## 文化特征\n\n河姆渡文化的农具，最具有代表性的是耒耜。河姆渡文化的建筑形式主要是栽桩架板高于地面的干栏式建筑。干栏式建筑是中国长江以南新石器时代以来的重要建筑形式之一，目 前河姆渡发现是为最早。它与北方地区同时期的半地穴房屋有着明显差别，成为当时最具有代表性的特征。因此，长江下游地区的新石器文化同样是中华文明的重要渊薮。它是代表中国古代文明发展趋势的另一条主线，与中原地区的仰韶文化并不相同。\n贯穿中华大地六千公里的亚洲第一大河“长江”，尽管总长超过了黄河，但长江流域诞生的古代文明以前并不为人所知，这是因为人们一直认为中华文明的发源归根到底还是黄河流域，只有黄河文明才是历史的主流，但是在长江下游一带却不断出现令人振奋的发现。首先，是和半坡遗址处于同一时代的河姆渡遗址的发现。稻穗纹陶盆上印有稻穗的图案，弯弯的稻穗图案使人想象到，河姆渡时期的人们已经开始了水稻的栽培。1987年的发掘中从遗址中出土了大量的稻壳，据发掘报告说总量达到150吨之多，在已经碳化的稻壳中可以看到稻米，分析的结果确认这是七千年前的稻米。水稻的栽培，使社会上大量的余粮屯积成为可能，随之而来的是贫富差别的出现。文化的发展也进入了新的阶段。\n河姆渡文化的社会经济是以稻作农业为主，兼营畜牧、采集和渔猎。在遗址中普遍发现有稻谷、谷壳、稻杆、稻叶等遗存。 遗址中还出土有许多动植物遗存，如：橡子、菱角、桃子、酸枣、葫芦、薏仁米和菌米与藻类植物遗存。\n河姆渡文化时期人们的居住地已形成大小各异的村落。在村落遗址中有许多房屋建筑基址。但由于该地是属于河岸沼泽区，所以房屋的建筑形式和结构与中原地区和长江中游地区发现的史前房屋有着明显的不同。\n生活用器，以陶器为主，并有少量木器。河姆渡文化是长江下游以南的一种较早的新石器时代。\n\n## 现存遗址\n\n鲻山遗址\n鲞架山遗址\n慈湖遗址\n小东门遗址\n傅家山遗址\n名山后遗址\n塔山遗址\n田螺山遗址\n白泉遗址\n灵山遗址\n施岙遗址\n\n河姆渡文化是分布于中国浙江宁波市至舟山群岛的新石器时代文化，其年代大约在西元前4000年到5000年之前，因以浙江省宁波市余姚市河姆渡镇河姆渡村遗址发掘最早，故称作河姆渡文化。\n\n在建筑方面，遗址中发现大量干栏式建筑的遗迹，牲畜。\n在人工制品上，石器数量较少，主要是斧等打猎工具，亦有较也有装饰品。多的是木器和骨器，其中发现中国最早的木制饰品“木雕鱼”，其他包括木柄骨制的耕田用具耜、和刀铲等切割器具，亦有大量纺织工具。在河姆渡并出土了中国境内所发现最早的漆器，其陶器制作有一定的水平，估计最高烧成温度达1000摄氏度。\n\n## 文化遗产\n\n### 综述\n\n河姆渡文化的陶器，以夹炭黑陶为主，少量夹砂、泥质灰陶，均为手制，烧成温度800-930℃。器型有釜、罐、杯、盘、钵、盆、缸、盂、灶、器盖、支座等。器表常有绳纹、刻划纹。有一些彩绘陶，绘以咖啡色、黑褐色的变体植物纹。\n河姆渡文化是分布在长江流域下游新石器时代文化。因遗址首先于1976年在浙江省宁波市的河姆渡被发现而得命名。据放射性碳素断代，年代约为公元前5000～公元前3300年。河姆渡文化分早、晚期。早期为约公元前5000～前4000年。晚期为约公元前4000～前3300年。河姆渡文化发展的时间介于裴李冈、磁山文化及半坡文化之间，主要分布在宁波，越海东达舟山岛  ，分布以长江流域为主，环境与华北不同，所以观察河姆渡遗址立体造景，可发现自然景观与裴李岗、磁山及半坡文化有相当大的差异。\n\n### 自然环境\n\n河姆渡遗址位于长江下游地区，河湖泥沙沉积土壤肥沃，为原始农业的产生提供了良好的条件。遗址附近水源丰富，适合需要水的稻作生长，普遍都发现稻谷、稻壳、稻杆、稻叶的遗存，是中国水稻栽培起源的最佳例证，也是目 前世界稻作史上最古老的人工栽培稻记录。当地降水多，气温高，应属常绿阔叶林和亚热带落叶阔叶林，森林有水鹿、野猪、牛等动物。\n河姆渡出土的大量野生动物遗骸，以鹿科动物最多，当时最具代表性的农具“骨耜”即采用鹿、水牛的肩胛骨加工制成。密布如织的沼泽，又为水生动植物提供了良好的生活环境，也为发展渔猎、饲养提供了必要的条件。遗址中所发现的柄叶连体木桨，证明已有舟楫之便，除用于交通外，可能也在渔猎活动中乘用。杆栏式的房屋也反映出为适应南方高温潮湿的生活环境。自然环境的不同，使河姆渡文化与华北黄河流域文化有所差别。\n\n### 住屋特质\n\n据地理勘测，河姆渡建筑遗址附近有一座小山，东北面当时是一片湖泊，这样的地理位置最适合\"干栏式建筑\"型式。干栏式住屋有许多特色，使居民能临水而居。地板在地面上通风凉快，可防潮防湿，也可防止大雨过后的泛滥，及不卫生的蒸气和低飞的昆虫聚集。残馀弃物可从地板空隙掷出，随水漂流；在陆上的杆栏建筑掷出物可成犬猪的饲料，地面上又可燃起熏出浓烟的火以防蚊虫。如建筑在地形崎岖之地，还可减免填土、挖掘；又因居高临下，也可防敌人袭击。\n河姆渡遗址出土许多桩柱、立柱、梁、板等建筑木构件，构件上有加工成的榫、卯（孔）、企口、销钉等，显示当时木作技术的杰出。柱子两端凸出的小方形称为榫、柱上凿出可将榫插入的孔为卯。遗址中所发现的两种木构衔接法，令人惊叹不已，至 今仍为木工工艺所沿用。一是企口板，企口可将两块木板拼接在一起而不露缝隙，遗址中发现的企口板两侧各有一道企口，可与另一块侧边削薄的木板相接，如今我们的木质地板还是用这方法拼接。另一是销钉孔，带销钉孔的榫和梁柱的卯垂直相交，用销钉栓住，榫头就不会从卯口脱出了。河姆渡遗址的建筑技术，可说已为中国木结构建筑打下了基础。\n\n### 编结纺织\n\n河姆渡出土的纺轮、两端削有缺口的卷布棍、梭形器和机刀等，据推测这些可能属于原始织布机附件，显示新石器时代人们已由手工编织发明了原始的机械。\n\n### 原始音乐\n\n河姆渡出土相当多的骨哨，是一种乐器，也是一种狩猎时模拟动物声音的狩猎工具。浙江杭州市还能看见一种用小竹管做成，发出鸟鸣声的竹哨，显然是河姆渡骨哨的遗存。陶埙也是河姆渡的出土遗物，埙身呈鸭蛋形、中空，一端有一小吹孔，也是中国一种古老的乐器，市面上观光区兜售的陶笛与此相似，只是河姆渡的陶埙只有吹孔而无音孔，可见它的原始。河姆渡遗址充分显示出南方长江流域在新石器时代中期文化的发展不亚于华北的文化，这可证明中国文化其实是多元发展，各有特色的!\n\n### 经济宗教\n\n用谷米酒曲酿酒是中国人的独创，河姆渡出土的中国最古老酒器——盉，把中国酒文化的历史推到了六千年之前，比古埃及人酿造葡萄酒要早一千年。河姆渡气候湿润，农业发达，水量充沛，酿成谷物酒的条件是成熟的，酒器中的盉，就是用来盛酒、调酒和温酒的专用器皿。\n河姆渡的陶盉，在20余年前出土在第三文化层。高度15厘米，口径8厘米，用夹砂灰红陶烧成，温度约一千度，盉的胎壁薄而匀，表面光洁，且施有灰红色陶衣，色彩艳丽而有变化，有的还有火炙痕。除了垂囊式外，还有圆底单把盉、罐状盉、带把三足盉等。在丈亭镇的鲻山遗址上，又发现了一件非常完整的6000年前陶盉，且是垂囊式，这是与先进陶灶，标志着人类文明的进步，否则只能做成三足盉才能在盉下燃火加热，因此将这种样式命名为河姆渡式陶盉。\n\n河姆渡文化图腾崇拜习俗，奉行的是太阳、鸟为主体的图腾崇拜，兼有蛇崇拜，是先人崇拜对象和部族象征标记的图腾。河姆渡遗址出土的“双鸟舁日”，从迄今考古和民俗学发现来看，是人类最早创造的具有完整形象的太阳神。\n鲞架山发现的一处人工填埋的红烧土台遗址，直径达3.4米，祭坛周围有零星的陶器，这说明这一处极有可能是河姆渡人的祭坛。六个同心圆应该象征着太阳，代表的是天，而鸟作为飞翔的使者，一方面是天与人之间交际的使者，另一方面是太阳升起、落下的运载工具，所反映的是河姆渡先民对于太阳的崇拜以及以鸟为图腾的敬仰。\n\n## 重要遗存\n\n### 稻谷\n\n河姆渡遗址两次考古发掘中，在第四文化层上部发现大面积的稻谷、稻秆、稻叶和木屑、苇编构成的稻谷堆积层，平均堆积厚度20～50厘米，最厚处超过100厘米。刚出土时稻谷外形完好，色泽金黄，少数稻谷连外壳的隆脉、稃毛及芸尖仍清晰可辨。经农史学家多次抽样鉴定认为是人工栽培水稻，是一个类粳、类籼及中间型等各种粒型的亚洲栽培稻属杂合群体。河姆渡遗址出土的稻谷数量之多、保存之完好，在世界考古史上是绝无仅有的。它不仅为研究我国稻作农业的起源提供了珍贵的实物资料，而且纠正了我国栽培水稻是从印度阿萨姆传递过来的传统说法，有力地证明我国也是世界上最早栽培水稻的国家。\n\n### 木构建筑遗迹\n\n河姆渡遗址两次考古发掘，在第二、三、四文化层都发现了木建筑遗迹，尤以第四文化层最为密集和壮观，总数在千件以上。主要木构件有木桩、圆木、长方形木材、带丫叉的柱子和地板。\n考古学家和古建筑专家对遗迹和木构件分析后认为，河姆渡的房屋是以一排排桩木为支架，上面架设大小梁承托地板，构成高于地面的架空基座，再于其上立柱、架梁、盖顶的干栏式建筑。在垂直相交的构件接点上，使用榫卯结构技术。把中国出现榫卯木作技术的时间从金属时代前推了3000多年。\n河姆渡遗址发掘中共发现29排木桩，分析至少有6栋以上建筑。根据木桩的排列与走向分析，当时的房屋呈西北———东南走向。从单体看，当时普遍采用连间长房子形式，其中最长一栋房屋面宽达23米以上，进深7米，房屋后檐还有宽1米左右的走廊过道。这栋房子可能是一个家族的住宅，房子的门开在山墙上，朝向为南偏东5°～10°。它在冬天能够最大限度利用阳光取暖，夏季则起到遮阳避光的作用，因而被现代人所继承。河姆渡时期的房屋建筑布局合理、设计科学、充分利用自然地理条件，使之有利人类的生活和居住。\n除建筑外，在遗址第二文化层还发现了迄今为止最早的水井遗迹。水井构筑于直径约6米的锅形水坑底部，用边长2米的四排木桩围成一个方形井壁，再在井口套上一个方木框作为围护。水坑四周还设有圆形栅栏，大概作护岸之用。河姆渡文化时期，居址周围河沼遍布，但水体与海水相通，致使盐份升高、苦卤而不堪饮用。所以水井的出现是人类为提高生活质量所作的努力，是人类本质所使然。\n\n### 人体遗骸\n\n河姆渡遗址考古发掘没有发现氏族公共墓地，只发现了27座零星墓葬。较完整的骨架仅13具。1978年3月，第二次考古发掘结束后，人类学家韩康信、潘其风先生曾到发掘现场，对他们的年龄、性别、体形、人种作出鉴定。其中未成年的儿童9具，成年人4具，编号M23、M17的头骨保存比较完整。\n（1）年龄。M23出自第三文化层，头骨硕大，前额接近阔额型，颧骨宽而外突，下颌厚大，男性特征明显。根据现代人头骨愈合和臼齿磨蚀度推算，年龄在30岁左右。M17头骨前额膨突，枕外隆凸缺乏，下颌枝内翻，尖形颏，特征显示为未成年女性，年龄约13~15岁。\n（2）身高。按照遗骸主要骨骼长度，用中国现代人身长特征，换算出身高。M23，身高为169～170厘米。M17身高为152～157厘米。\n（3）人种。M23、M17颧骨较高和宽，铲形门齿，与新石器时代黄河流域居民相同。而鼻骨低平、凹形鼻梁、低矮的眼眶，与我国南方新石器时代居民更为接近，应为南方汉族人种。\n\n## 主要器物\n\n### 陶器\n\n河姆渡遗址是中国新石器时代遗址考古中陶器出土最多、复原率最高的遗址之一，两次考古发掘，出土陶片40万件之多，完整的和可复原的陶器占总出土器物的1/6左右，已获得完整器和复原器1221件。出土陶器中最具特色的是早期的夹碳黑陶，这是河姆渡先民有意识地在陶土中掺和了炭末，主要是为了减少陶土粘性，提高成品率。陶器的种类很多，主要有釜、罐、盆、盘、钵、豆、盉、甑、鼎等，按使用功能可以分为炊煮器、饮食器、储存器、汲水器。较为特殊的有灶和盉两种。陶灶形似簸箕，内壁有3个乳钉状足，为安放釜而设置。陶灶发明后，解决了木构建筑内煮炊防火问题，是后世南方居民一直使用的缸灶的前身。\n陶盉形似酒壶，前有冲天管状嘴，后为喇吹口，中间以扁平半耳环连结。器壁内外打磨光滑，制作精细，今 天看仍有很高的艺术欣赏价值。多数专家认为这是一种酒器。\n\n### 石器\n\n河姆渡遗址石器的数量和种类都不算丰富，共出土874件。按功能分，主要是生产工具和装饰品两大类。生产工具有斧、锛、凿三种，器形较小，磨制不精，尚留有不少打击和琢制的痕迹。大多属于砍伐树木和加工木构件的工具，有的可作为农具和加工骨、木的工具。其它的石器还有砺石和马鞍形石块、石球，后二种可能是谷物和硬壳果实的脱壳工具。\n\n### 骨器\n\n出土的骨器有3000多件，是河姆渡先民的重要生产工具，按使用功能分为骨耜、骨箭头、骨凿、骨锥、骨针、骨哨、骨镰、骨鱼镖、管状针等，以骨耜最具特色。\n骨耜取材于大、中型哺乳类动物的肩胛骨。耜的外形基本保持原骨的自然形状，上端厚而窄，下端刃部薄而宽。骨面正中有一道竖向浅槽，下端呈圆舌形，其两侧有两个平行的长方孔，上端有一横穿方銎。是为绑扎竖向木柄而设计的。这种制作方法为河姆渡文化遗址所特有。骨耜通体光滑，有的刃部因长久与土壤磨擦而残缺或形成双叉、三叉式。这是一种很具特色的农业生产工具。遗址出土骨耜有170件之多，与数量巨大的稻谷堆积物相对应，说明河姆渡农业已从采集进入到耜耕生产阶段。\n\n### 木器\n\n木器共300多件，大多出土于第四文化层，说明距今7000年前，木器已被广泛用于生产和生活的各个方面，木器制作技术已达到相当高的水平。最为重要的木器是纺织工具和木桨。纺织工具有木（陶）纺轮、齿状器、木机刀、卷布棍、圆木棒、尖头小棒、木（骨）匕等。纺织专家认为是踞织机的零件。有了纺织，说明河姆渡先民已脱离茹毛饮血的野蛮生活，进入初具文明的历史阶段。\n木桨共8件，采用整块木料加工制作而成，柄部为圆形，桨叶呈柳叶形。有桨必有船，早在7000年前，河姆渡先民就划桨行舟，用于捕捞和邻近氏族之间的交通往来。\n\n### 原始艺术品\n\n河姆渡遗址出土的原始艺术品不仅数量大，而且题材广，造型独特，内容丰富多彩。主要表现 在象牙雕刻、陶器纹饰上面，尤其是一些象牙雕刻器，线条流畅，造型美观，令人叹为观止。\n（1）象牙雕刻艺术。蝶形器8件，以扁平的象牙片磨制而成，因形同平展的蝴蝶而命名。其中最引人注目的是一件“双鸟朝阳”纹象牙碟形器，长16.6厘米，宽5.9厘米，厚1.1厘米，上半部残缺，底端也稍残。正面中间阴刻5个大小不等的同心圆，外圆上端刻有熊熊的火焰纹，象征太阳的光芒，两侧各有一只引昂勾喙鸷鸟拥载太阳，器物边缘还锥刻羽状纹。整件器物图像布局严谨、雕刻技术娴熟、形象逼真传神、寓意耐人寻味，是河姆渡原始艺术的精品。\n鸟形圆雕4件。其中有一件完整器长15.8厘米，宽3.4厘米，厚0.8厘米，柄端雕出俯首的鸟头，圆目勾喙，似鹰类猛禽，中间为鸟身和翅膀，背面平整，阴刻短直线和斜线组成的图案，两侧也有斜线和弯月形短线，羽毛感强烈。腹部较厚，有横向突脊，其上有透孔，作穿绳佩挂之用。尾部扁长，略成圆弧。这些精致的艺术品虽是氏族的共同财产，但只有氏族首领才有权利使用。\n（2）陶器刻画作品。刻划于陶器口沿和腹部，内容包括太阳、月亮、花草树木、鱼鸟虫兽等，画面简洁舒展，风格朴实而又生机盎然，既反映了河姆渡先民热爱生活、热爱大自然的美好情感，也折射出先民期望风调雨顺、农业丰收的内心世界。代表作品有鱼藻纹陶盆、稻穗纹陶盆、猪纹陶钵、五叶纹陶块等。这些带有刻画艺术的陶器，出土时基本完整，即使是碎片，也是原地压碎，可以拼复完整，说明河姆渡先民对它们特别珍重，应是祭祀用品，推测原始宗教意识已在先民中萌芽。\n（3）人体装饰品。有璜、管、珠、环、饼等。珠、环等饰品大多用玉和莹石制成，在阳光下闪烁着淡绿的光彩，晶莹美丽。还有一些以兽类的獠牙或犬牙、鱼类的脊椎骨制成的装饰品。\n\n## 经济状况\n\n河姆渡文化的发现表明，新石器时代中期宁波的农业经济和家畜饲养都比较发达\n。在河姆渡遗址的大面积范围内，普遍发现了稻谷遗存，有的地方稻谷、稻叶、稻壳等交互混杂，形成 0．2—0．5 米厚的堆积层，最厚处超过 1 米。稻类遗存数量之多、保存之完好，都是中国远古各氏族文化遗存中所罕见的。经鉴定，主要属于栽培稻籼亚种晚稻型水稻，是世界上目 前最古老的人工栽培稻，对于探讨中国水稻栽培的起源及其在世界稻作农业史上的地位，具有重要的意义。\n遗址中发现了大批农业生产工具，其中有代表性的农具是翻耕土地的骨耜，仅河姆渡一处就出土上百件。骨耜采用鹿、水牛的肩胛骨加工制成，肩臼处一般穿凿横銎，骨质较薄者则无銎而将肩臼部分修磨成半月形。在耜冠正面中部刻挖竖槽，并在其两侧各凿一孔。还发现了安装在骨耜上的木柄，下端嵌入槽内，横銎里穿绕多圈藤条以缚紧，顶端做成丁字形或透雕三角形捉手孔。此外，还出土了很少的木耜、穿孔石斧、双孔石刀和长近 1 米的舂米木杵等农业生产和谷物加工工具。\n家畜主要有猪和狗。破碎的猪骨和猪牙齿到处可见，并发现捏塑的体态肥胖的陶猪和在黑陶钵上刻划的猪图饰。有一件陶盆上同时刻划着稻穗和猪的图像，具体而生动地反映出家畜饲养依附于农业生产的实际情况。许多骨耜是用水牛的肩胛骨制作的，说明水牛当时已被驯养。\n河姆渡部落的原始手工业也是比较发达的，在经济生活中起一定的作用。制陶业、纺织业、骨器制作、竹木器加工都比较进步。这一带的氏族先民烧制的陶器，以夹炭黑陶最富特点。尤其在早期，种类比较单一，无论炊具还是炊食器一律都是夹炭黑陶，胎泥纯净，含铁量仅为 1．5%左右，以大量的稻壳、茎叶碎末为羼和料，工艺技术上还比较原始。稍晚出现了一些夹砂红陶和褐陶。各种器物均为手制，不甚规整，据测试，烧成温度在 800—900℃，在缺氧的还原焰中烧制而成。陶器的胎质比较粗厚疏松，重量较轻，吸水性强，比较容易破碎，到了晚期，基本上仍用手制，但有些器物已经用慢轮进行修整，出现了三足器、袋足器等较为复杂的新产品。有些陶器火候较高，烧成温度已达到 1000℃左右。\n\n## 文化分布\n\n1981年，河姆渡遗址发掘以后，浙江省文物考古研究所对河姆渡文化的分布范围开展调查，21世纪在基本建设中也发现了一些重要遗址，至今在宁波市共发现河姆渡文化遗址49处，其中以姚江两岸最密集，共有31处。\n近几年考古发掘的重要遗址有丈亭镇鲻山遗址、三七市镇田螺山遗址、慈城镇傅家山遗址。这三处遗址位于河姆渡以北10公里之内，文化内涵和河姆渡遗址一致，仅有少量文物是首次发现。如田螺山遗址发现北方遗址经常出土的高达90厘米的深腹罐，这是南北文化交流还是自己创造发明，引起考古界的争论（河姆渡与田螺山之间在远古时期是一片）。不管怎样，这些遗址发现发掘，丰富了河姆渡文化内涵，说明河姆渡遗址并不是孤立的，早在7000年前我们的祖先就在宁波这块富饶的土地上劳动生息，为中华民族的形成和发展作出了重大的贡献。", "河姆渡文化，是指中国长江流域下游以南地区古老而多姿的新石器时代文化（即距今约7000年前）。黑陶是河姆渡陶器的一大特色；在建筑方面，遗址中发现大量\"干栏式房屋\"的遗迹。\n1973年，第一次发现于浙江宁波余姚的河姆渡镇，因而命名。它主要分布在杭州湾南岸的宁绍平原及舟山岛。经科学的方法进行测定，它的年代为公元前5000年至公元前3300年（距今约7021----5021年）。它是新石器时代母系氏族公社时期的氏族村落遗址，反映了距今约7000年前长江下游流域氏族的情况。\n我国上古时代传说中的“有巢氏”部落其实就是居住在宁绍平原的古越族-河姆渡人的一支。有巢氏是中国古代传说中”构木为巢“的巢居发明者；而这正是对宁绍平原河姆渡人”干栏式房屋“的映射与形容。\n有巢氏，尊号”巢皇“、”大巢氏“，中国上古时期部落首领，相传为燧人氏之父、伏羲氏与女娲氏的祖父。曾率领其部落人民以宁绍平原为起点两度迁徙；先后到达今浙江杭嘉湖平原与今安徽巢湖流域，并在良渚古城登基成为了良渚古国的最后一代君主；后期又在今山东琅琊古城（位于今山东省青岛市黄岛区）建立了陪都。而后又在今巢湖一带建立了古巢国，定都凌家滩古城（今安徽凌家滩遗址）。\n河姆渡文化因有巢氏先民的迁徙而加速与外界文化的融合与发展，与浙江良渚文化、安徽凌家滩文化广泛交融；共同构成了有巢氏先民赖以生存的社会文化背景。\n\n## 考古发现\n\n河姆渡文化最早在1973年被发现，在1973~1974和1977~1978年两次对河姆渡遗址作发掘并有资料。黑陶是河姆渡陶器的一大特色。在建筑方面，遗址中发现大量干栏式建筑的遗迹。\n\n相传中国上古部落首领“有巢氏”便是隶属于浙东地区的古越族-河姆渡人的一支，是宁绍平原上生活着的河姆渡人的一员。\n有巢氏，尊号“巢皇”、“大巢氏”，中国上古时代部落首领；前4964----前4464年在位。中国古代神话传说中构木为巢的发明者；相传为燧人氏之父、伏羲与女娲的祖父；是良渚古国的末代君主以及古巢国开国君主。而河姆渡文化也是有巢氏执政早期的文化。河姆渡文化与良渚文化、凌家滩文化有着一定程度上的传承关系。\n河姆渡文化的骨器制作比较进步，有耜、鱼镖、镞、哨、匕、锥、锯形器等器物，精心磨制而成，一些有柄骨匕、骨笄上雕刻花纹或双头连体鸟纹图案，就像是精美绝伦的实用工艺品。在众多的出土文物中，最重要的是发现了大量人工栽培的稻谷，这是目 前世界上最古老、最丰富的稻作文化遗址。它的发现，改变了中国栽培水稻从印度引进的传统传说。\n\n## 文化特征\n\n河姆渡文化的农具，最具有代表性的是耒耜。河姆渡文化的建筑形式主要是栽桩架板高于地面的干栏式建筑。干栏式建筑是中国长江以南新石器时代以来的重要建筑形式之一，目 前河姆渡发现是为最早。它与北方地区同时期的半地穴房屋有着明显差别，成为当时最具有代表性的特征。因此，长江下游地区的新石器文化同样是中华文明的重要渊薮。它是代表中国古代文明发展趋势的另一条主线，与中原地区的仰韶文化并不相同。\n贯穿中华大地六千公里的亚洲第一大河“长江”，尽管总长超过了黄河，但长江流域诞生的古代文明以前并不为人所知，这是因为人们一直认为中华文明的发源归根到底还是黄河流域，只有黄河文明才是历史的主流，但是在长江下游一带却不断出现令人振奋的发现。首先，是和半坡遗址处于同一时代的河姆渡遗址的发现。稻穗纹陶盆上印有稻穗的图案，弯弯的稻穗图案使人想象到，河姆渡时期的人们已经开始了水稻的栽培。1987年的发掘中从遗址中出土了大量的稻壳，据发掘报告说总量达到150吨之多，在已经碳化的稻壳中可以看到稻米，分析的结果确认这是七千年前的稻米。水稻的栽培，使社会上大量的余粮屯积成为可能，随之而来的是贫富差别的出现。文化的发展也进入了新的阶段。\n河姆渡文化的社会经济是以稻作农业为主，兼营畜牧、采集和渔猎。在遗址中普遍发现有稻谷、谷壳、稻杆、稻叶等遗存。 遗址中还出土有许多动植物遗存，如：橡子、菱角、桃子、酸枣、葫芦、薏仁米和菌米与藻类植物遗存。\n河姆渡文化时期人们的居住地已形成大小各异的村落。在村落遗址中有许多房屋建筑基址。但由于该地是属于河岸沼泽区，所以房屋的建筑形式和结构与中原地区和长江中游地区发现的史前房屋有着明显的不同。\n生活用器，以陶器为主，并有少量木器。河姆渡文化是长江下游以南的一种较早的新石器时代。\n\n## 现存遗址\n\n河姆渡遗址——鲻山遗址\n鲞架山遗址\n慈湖遗址\n小东门遗址\n傅家山遗址\n名山后遗址\n塔山遗址\n田螺山遗址\n白泉遗址\n灵山遗址\n河姆渡文化是分布于中国浙江杭州湾南岸平原地区至舟山群岛的新石器时代文化，其年代大约在西元前4000年到5000年之前，因以浙江余姚河姆渡村遗址发掘最早，故称作河姆渡文化。\n在建筑方面，遗址中发现大量干栏式建筑的遗迹，牲畜。\n在人工制品上，石器数量较少，主要是斧等打猎工具，亦有较也有装饰品。多的是木器和骨器，其中发现中国最早的木制饰品“木雕鱼”，其他包括木柄骨制的耕田用具耜、和刀铲等切割器具，亦有大量纺织工具。在河姆渡并出土了中国境内所发现最早的漆器，其陶器制作有一定的水平，估计最高烧成温度达1000摄氏度。\n\n## 文化遗产\n\n### 综述\n\n河姆渡文化的陶器，以夹炭黑陶为主，少量夹砂、泥质灰陶，均为手制，烧成温度800-930℃。器型有釜、罐、杯、盘、钵、盆、缸、盂、灶、器盖、支座等。器表常有绳纹、刻划纹。有一些彩绘陶，绘以咖啡色、黑褐色的变体植物纹。\n河姆渡文化是分布在长江流域下游新石器时代文化。因遗址首先于1976年在浙江省余姚县的河姆渡被发现而得命名。据放射性碳素断代，年代约为公元前5000～公元前3300年。河姆渡文化分早、晚期。早期为约公元前5000～前4000年。晚期为约公元前4000～前3300年。河姆渡文化发展的时间介于裴李冈、磁山文化及半坡文化之间，主要分布在杭州湾南岸的宁波（绍兴）平原，并越海东达舟山岛，分布以长江流域为主，环境与华北不同，所以观察河姆渡遗址立体造景，可发现自然景观与裴李岗、磁山及半坡文化有相当大的差异。\n\n### 自然环境\n\n河姆渡遗址位于长江下游地区，河湖泥沙沉积土壤肥沃，为原始农业的产生提供了良好的条件。遗址附近水源丰富，适合需要水的稻作生长，普遍都发现稻谷、稻壳、稻杆、稻叶的遗存，是中国水稻栽培起源的最佳例证，也是目 前世界稻作史上最古老的人工栽培稻记录。当地降水多，气温高，应属常绿阔叶林和亚热带落叶阔叶林，森林有水鹿、野猪、牛等动物。\n河姆渡出土的大量野生动物遗骸，以鹿科动物最多，当时最具代表性的农具“骨耜”即采用鹿、水牛的肩胛骨加工制成。密布如织的沼泽，又为水生动植物提供了良好的生活环境，也为发展渔猎、饲养提供了必要的条件。遗址中所发现的柄叶连体木桨，证明已有舟楫之便，除用于交通外，可能也在渔猎活动中乘用。杆栏式的房屋也反映出为适应南方高温潮湿的生活环境。自然环境的不同，使河姆渡文化与华北黄河流域文化有所差别。\n\n### 住屋特质\n\n据地理勘测，河姆渡建筑遗址附近有一座小山，东北面当时是一片湖泊，这样的地理位置最适合\"干栏式建筑\"型式。干栏式住屋有许多特色，使居民能临水而居。地板在地面上通风凉快，可防潮防湿，也可防止大雨过后的泛滥，及不卫生的蒸气和低飞的昆虫聚集。残馀弃物可从地板空隙掷出，随水漂流；在陆上的杆栏建筑掷出物可成犬猪的饲料，地面上又可燃起熏出浓烟的火以防蚊虫。如建筑在地形崎岖之地，还可减免填土、挖掘；又因居高临下，也可防敌人袭击。\n河姆渡遗址出土许多桩柱、立柱、梁、板等建筑木构件，构件上有加工成的榫、卯（孔）、企口、销钉等，显示当时木作技术的杰出。柱子两端凸出的小方形称为榫、柱上凿出可将榫插入的孔为卯。遗址中所发现的两种木构衔接法，令人惊叹不已，至 今仍为木工工艺所沿用。一是企口板，企口可将两块木板拼接在一起而不露缝隙，遗址中发现的企口板两侧各有一道企口，可与另一块侧边削薄的木板相接，如今我们的木质地板还是用这方法拼接。另一是销钉孔，带销钉孔的榫和梁柱的卯垂直相交，用销钉栓住，榫头就不会从卯口脱出了。河姆渡遗址的建筑技术，可说已为中国木结构建筑打下了基础。\n\n### 编结纺织\n\n河姆渡出土的纺轮、两端削有缺口的卷布棍、梭形器和机刀等，据推测这些可能属于原始织布机附件，显示新石器时代人们已由手工编织发明了原始的机械。\n\n### 原始音乐\n\n河姆渡出土相当多的骨哨，是一种乐器，也是一种狩猎时模拟动物声音的狩猎工具。浙江杭州市还能看见一种用小竹管做成，发出鸟鸣声的竹哨，显然是河姆渡骨哨的遗存。陶埙也是河姆渡的出土遗物，埙身呈鸭蛋形、中空，一端有一小吹孔，也是中国一种古老的乐器，市面上观光区兜售的陶笛与此相似，只是河姆渡的陶埙只有吹孔而无音孔，可见它的原始。河姆渡遗址充分显示出南方长江流域在新石器时代中期文化的发展不亚于华北的文化，这可证明中国文化其实是多元发展，各有特色的!\n\n### 经济和宗教生活\n\n酒器的出现显示农业收获较前丰富，才有馀粮酿酒。河南龙山文化中，还流行以猪、牛、羊、鹿的肩胛骨为材料制成卜骨，将卜骨加以烧灼，观察兆文以解释吉凶。占卜显示此时已有某种程度的信仰。另外在龙山的两座窖穴里还发现了炼铜用的坩锅残片，说明当时已能铸造铜器。一般认为河南龙山文化处于原始农业社会解体阶段，最终发展为中国文明初期的青铜文化。\n犴是河姆渡先民的图腾，犴的动物原型是原始社会时期生活在宁绍平原一带的麋鹿。河姆渡先民为表达对犴图腾的崇拜，衍生出一种民间舞蹈，犴舞。这种图腾崇拜的舞蹈，至 今在河姆渡遗址所在的余姚地区流传。余姚犴舞是一种鼓捣的传统民俗舞蹈，历史上分布于浙江省余姚市西部平原及西北一带，以马渚境内为主，还包括与马渚西北部相邻的牟山和泗门。目 前只有泗门一带还留存有犴舞迎新年的习俗。犴舞是余姚独有的，极具地方特色的民间舞蹈，源于河姆渡远古先民的图腾崇拜，在传统的民俗活动、宗教仪式等民风习俗中保留下来。\n\n## 重要遗存\n\n### 稻谷\n\n河姆渡遗址两次考古发掘中，在第四文化层上部发现大面积的稻谷、稻秆、稻叶和木屑、苇编构成的稻谷堆积层，平均堆积厚度20～50厘米，最厚处超过100厘米。刚出土时稻谷外形完好，色泽金黄，少数稻谷连外壳的隆脉、稃毛及芸尖仍清晰可辨。经农史学家多次抽样鉴定认为是人工栽培水稻，是一个类粳、类籼及中间型等各种粒型的亚洲栽培稻属杂合群体。河姆渡遗址出土的稻谷数量之多、保存之完好，在世界考古史上是绝无仅有的。它不仅为研究我国稻作农业的起源提供了珍贵的实物资料，而且纠正了我国栽培水稻是从印度阿萨姆传递过来的传统说法，有力地证明我国也是世界上最早栽培水稻的国家。\n\n### 木构建筑遗迹\n\n河姆渡遗址两次考古发掘，在第二、三、四文化层都发现了木建筑遗迹，尤以第四文化层最为密集和壮观，总数在千件以上。主要木构件有木桩、圆木、长方形木材、带丫叉的柱子和地板。\n考古学家和古建筑专家对遗迹和木构件分析后认为，河姆渡的房屋是以一排排桩木为支架，上面架设大小梁承托地板，构成高于地面的架空基座，再于其上立柱、架梁、盖顶的干栏式建筑。在垂直相交的构件接点上，使用榫卯结构技术。把中国出现榫卯木作技术的时间从金属时代前推了3000多年。\n河姆渡遗址发掘中共发现29排木桩，分析至少有6栋以上建筑。根据木桩的排列与走向分析，当时的房屋呈西北———东南走向。从单体看，当时普遍采用连间长房子形式，其中最长一栋房屋面宽达23米以上，进深7米，房屋后檐还有宽1米左右的走廊过道。这栋房子可能是一个家族的住宅，房子的门开在山墙上，朝向为南偏东5°～10°。它在冬天能够最大限度利用阳光取暖，夏季则起到遮阳避光的作用，因而被现代人所继承。河姆渡时期的房屋建筑布局合理、设计科学、充分利用自然地理条件，使之有利人类的生活和居住。\n除建筑外，在遗址第二文化层还发现了迄今为止最早的水井遗迹。水井构筑于直径约6米的锅形水坑底部，用边长2米的四排木桩围成一个方形井壁，再在井口套上一个方木框作为围护。水坑四周还设有圆形栅栏，大概作护岸之用。河姆渡文化时期，居址周围河沼遍布，但水体与海水相通，致使盐份升高、苦卤而不堪饮用。所以水井的出现是人类为提高生活质量所作的努力，是人类本质所使然。\n\n### 人体遗骸\n\n河姆渡遗址考古发掘没有发现氏族公共墓地，只发现了27座零星墓葬。较完整的骨架仅13具。1978年3月，第二次考古发掘结束后，人类学家韩康信、潘其风先生曾到发掘现场，对他们的年龄、性别、体形、人种作出鉴定。其中未成年的儿童9具，成年人4具，编号M23、M17的头骨保存比较完整。\n（1）年龄。M23出自第三文化层，头骨硕大，前额接近阔额型，颧骨宽而外突，下颌厚大，男性特征明显。根据现代人头骨愈合和臼齿磨蚀度推算，年龄在30岁左右。M17头骨前额膨突，枕外隆凸缺乏，下颌枝内翻，尖形颏，特征显示为未成年女性，年龄约13－15岁。\n（2）身高。按照遗骸主要骨骼长度，用中国现代人身长特征，换算出身高。M23，身高为169～170厘米。M17身高为152～157厘米。\n（3）人种。M23、M17颧骨较高和宽，铲形门齿，与新石器时代黄河流域居民相同。而鼻骨低平、凹形鼻梁、低矮的眼眶，与我国南方新石器时代居民更为接近，应为南方汉族人种。\n\n## 主要器物\n\n### 陶器\n\n河姆渡遗址是中国新石器时代遗址考古中陶器出土最多、复原率最高的遗址之一，两次考古发掘，出土陶片40万件之多，完整的和可复原的陶器占总出土器物的1/6左右，已获得完整器和复原器1221件。出土陶器中最具特色的是早期的夹碳黑陶，这是河姆渡先民有意识地在陶土中掺和了炭末，主要是为了减少陶土粘性，提高成品率。陶器的种类很多，主要有釜、罐、盆、盘、钵、豆、盉、甑、鼎等，按使用功能可以分为炊煮器、饮食器、储存器、汲水器。较为特殊的有灶和盉两种。陶灶形似簸箕，内壁有3个乳钉状足，为安放釜而设置。陶灶发明后，解决了木构建筑内煮炊防火问题，是后世南方居民一直使用的缸灶的前身。\n陶盉形似酒壶，前有冲天管状嘴，后为喇吹口，中间以扁平半耳环连结。器壁内外打磨光滑，制作精细，今 天看仍有很高的艺术欣赏价值。多数专家认为这是一种酒器。\n\n### 石器\n\n河姆渡遗址石器的数量和种类都不算丰富，共出土874件。按功能分，主要是生产工具和装饰品两大类。生产工具有斧、锛、凿三种，器形较小，磨制不精，尚留有不少打击和琢制的痕迹。大多属于砍伐树木和加工木构件的工具，有的可作为农具和加工骨、木的工具。其它的石器还有砺石和马鞍形石块、石球，后二种可能是谷物和硬壳果实的脱壳工具。\n\n### 骨器\n\n出土的骨器有3000多件，是河姆渡先民的重要生产工具，按使用功能分为骨耜、骨箭头、骨凿、骨锥、骨针、骨哨、骨镰、骨鱼镖、管状针等，以骨耜最具特色。\n骨耜取材于大、中型哺乳类动物的肩胛骨。耜的外形基本保持原骨的自然形状，上端厚而窄，下端刃部薄而宽。骨面正中有一道竖向浅槽，下端呈圆舌形，其两侧有两个平行的长方孔，上端有一横穿方銎。是为绑扎竖向木柄而设计的。这种制作方法为河姆渡文化遗址所特有。骨耜通体光滑，有的刃部因长久与土壤磨擦而残缺或形成双叉、三叉式。这是一种很具特色的农业生产工具。遗址出土骨耜有170件之多，与数量巨大的稻谷堆积物相对应，说明河姆渡农业已从采集进入到耜耕生产阶段。\n\n### 木器\n\n木器共300多件，大多出土于第四文化层，说明距今7000年前，木器已被广泛用于生产和生活的各个方面，木器制作技术已达到相当高的水平。最为重要的木器是纺织工具和木桨。纺织工具有木（陶）纺轮、齿状器、木机刀、卷布棍、圆木棒、尖头小棒、木（骨）匕等。纺织专家认为是踞织机的零件。有了纺织，说明河姆渡先民已脱离茹毛饮血的野蛮生活，进入初具文明的历史阶段。\n木桨共8件，采用整块木料加工制作而成，柄部为圆形，桨叶呈柳叶形。有桨必有船，早在7000年前，河姆渡先民就划桨行舟，用于捕捞和邻近氏族之间的交通往来。\n\n### 原始艺术品\n\n河姆渡遗址出土的原始艺术品不仅数量大，而且题材广，造型独特，内容丰富多彩。主要表现 在象牙雕刻、陶器纹饰上面，尤其是一些象牙雕刻器，线条流畅，造型美观，令人叹为观止。\n（1）象牙雕刻艺术。蝶形器8件，以扁平的象牙片磨制而成，因形同平展的蝴蝶而命名。其中最引人注目的是一件“双鸟朝阳”纹象牙碟形器，长16.6厘米，宽5.9厘米，厚1.1厘米，上半部残缺，底端也稍残。正面中间阴刻5个大小不等的同心圆，外圆上端刻有熊熊的火焰纹，象征太阳的光芒，两侧各有一只引昂勾喙鸷鸟拥载太阳，器物边缘还锥刻羽状纹。整件器物图像布局严谨、雕刻技术娴熟、形象逼真传神、寓意耐人寻味，是河姆渡原始艺术的精品。\n鸟形圆雕4件。其中有一件完整器长15.8厘米，宽3.4厘米，厚0.8厘米，柄端雕出俯首的鸟头，圆目勾喙，似鹰类猛禽，中间为鸟身和翅膀，背面平整，阴刻短直线和斜线组成的图案，两侧也有斜线和弯月形短线，羽毛感强烈。腹部较厚，有横向突脊，其上有透孔，作穿绳佩挂之用。尾部扁长，略成圆弧。这些精致的艺术品虽是氏族的共同财产，但只有氏族首领才有权利使用。\n（2）陶器刻画作品。刻划于陶器口沿和腹部，内容包括太阳、月亮、花草树木、鱼鸟虫兽等，画面简洁舒展，风格朴实而又生机盎然，既反映了河姆渡先民热爱生活、热爱大自然的美好情感，也折射出先民期望风调雨顺、农业丰收的内心世界。代表作品有鱼藻纹陶盆、稻穗纹陶盆、猪纹陶钵、五叶纹陶块等。这些带有刻画艺术的陶器，出土时基本完整，即使是碎片，也是原地压碎，可以拼复完整，说明河姆渡先民对它们特别珍重，应是祭祀用品，推测原始宗教意识已在先民中萌芽。\n（3）人体装饰品。有璜、管、珠、环、饼等。珠、环等饰品大多用玉和莹石制成，在阳光下闪烁着淡绿的光彩，晶莹美丽。还有一些以兽类的獠牙或犬牙、鱼类的脊椎骨制成的装饰品。\n\n## 经济状况\n\n河姆渡文化的发现表明，新石器时代中期宁绍平原的农业经济和家畜饲养都比较发达。在河姆渡遗址的大面积范围内，普遍发现了稻谷遗存，有的地方稻谷、稻叶、稻壳等交互混杂，形成 0．2—0．5 米厚的堆积层，最厚处超过 1 米。稻类遗存数量之多、保存之完好，都是中国远古各氏族文化遗存中所罕见的。经鉴定，主要属于栽培稻籼亚种晚稻型水稻，是世界上目 前最古老的人工栽培稻，对于探讨中国水稻栽培的起源及其在世界稻作农业史上的地位，具有重要的意义。\n遗址中发现了大批农业生产工具，其中有代表性的农具是翻耕土地的骨耜，仅河姆渡一处就出土上百件。骨耜采用鹿、水牛的肩胛骨加工制成，肩臼处一般穿凿横銎，骨质较薄者则无銎而将肩臼部分修磨成半月形。在耜冠正面中部刻挖竖槽，并在其两侧各凿一孔。还发现了安装在骨耜上的木柄，下端嵌入槽内，横銎里穿绕多圈藤条以缚紧，顶端做成丁字形或透雕三角形捉手孔。此外，还出土了很少的木耜、穿孔石斧、双孔石刀和长近 1 米的舂米木杵等农业生产和谷物加工工具。\n家畜主要有猪和狗。破碎的猪骨和猪牙齿到处可见，并发现捏塑的体态肥胖的陶猪和在黑陶钵上刻划的猪图饰。有一件陶盆上同时刻划着稻穗和猪的图像，具体而生动地反映出家畜饲养依附于农业生产的实际情况。许多骨耜是用水牛的肩胛骨制作的，说明水牛当时已被驯养。\n河姆渡部落的原始手工业也是比较发达的，在经济生活中起一定的作用。制陶业、纺织业、骨器制作、竹木器加工都比较进步。这一带的氏族先民烧制的陶器，以夹炭黑陶最富特点。尤其在早期，种类比较单一，无论炊具还是炊食器一律都是夹炭黑陶，胎泥纯净，含铁量仅为 1．5%左右，以大量的稻壳、茎叶碎末为羼和料，工艺技术上还比较原始。稍晚出现了一些夹砂红陶和褐陶。各种器物均为手制，不甚规整，据测试，烧成温度在 800—900℃，在缺氧的还原焰中烧制而成。陶器的胎质比较粗厚疏松，重量较轻，吸水性强，比较容易破碎，到了晚期，基本上仍用手制，但有些器物已经用慢轮进行修整，出现了三足器、袋足器等较为复杂的新产品。有些陶器火候较高，烧成温度已达到 1000℃左右。\n\n## 文化分布\n\n1981年，河姆渡遗址发掘以后，浙江省文物考古研究所对河姆渡文化的分布范围开展调查，21世纪在基本建设中也发现了一些重要遗址，至 今在宁绍平原共发现河姆渡文化遗址49处，其中以姚江两岸最密集，共有31处。\n近几年考古发掘的重要遗址有余姚市丈亭镇鲻山遗址、三七市镇田螺山遗址、宁波市江北区傅家遗址。这三处遗址位于河姆渡以北10公里之内，文化内涵和河姆渡遗址一致，仅有少量文物是首次发现。如田螺山遗址发现北方遗址经常出土的高达90厘米的深腹罐，这是南北文化交流还是自己创造发明，引起考古界的争论（河姆渡与田螺山之间在远古时期是一片）。不管怎样，这些遗址发现发掘，丰富了河姆渡文化内涵，说明河姆渡遗址并不是孤立的，早在7000年前我们的祖先就在宁波这块富饶的土地上劳动生息，为中华民族的形成和发展作出了重大的贡献。", "## 河姆渡文化\n河姆渡文化是分布于中国浙江杭州湾南岸平原地区至舟山群岛的新石器时代文化，其年代大约在距今6000年到7000年之前，因以浙江余姚河姆渡遗址发掘最早，故称作河姆渡文化。\n该文化最早在1973年发现，河姆渡遗址在1973﹣1974和1977﹣1978年两次发掘并有资料。在建筑方面，遗址中发现大量干栏式建筑的遗迹；在食物方面，植物有大量水稻发现，被断定是人工栽培的水稻，此外植物残存尚有葫芦、橡子、菱角、枣子等，动物有猪、狗、水牛等家养的牲畜。\n在人工制品上，石器数量较少，主要是斧等打猎工具，亦有装饰品。多的是木器和骨器，其中发现中国最早的木制饰品木雕鱼，其他包括木柄骨制的耕田用具耜、和刀铲等切割器具，亦有大量纺织工具。在河姆渡并出土了中国境内所发现最早的漆器，其陶器制作有一定的水准，估计最高烧成温度达1000摄氏度。河姆渡陶器为手工制作，十分厚实，呈灰黑色，表面常打磨，常有绳纹，或雕刻植物、动物图案。其他的河姆渡手工艺品，包括粗陶动物及人偶，以及鸟类图案的木雕及象牙雕，其中以「双火鸟」纹雕刻最为知名。"],

皮肤科\n来自：百科名医网", "## 水俣病\n水病（水俣病），为公害病的一种，成因为汞中毒。1956年左右于熊本县水俣市附近发生，经确认后依地得名。不久，于新潟县发现的新公害病亦称为水俣病。其区别为：前者称熊本水俣病；后者则为第二水俣病或新潟水俣病。\n以上两种水俣病，与痛痛病、四日市哮喘并列为日本四大公害病。\n## 病征\n水俣病实际为有机水银中毒，分为急性、亚急性、慢性、潜在性和胎儿性等多种类型。患者手足麻痺，甚至步行困难、运动障碍、失智、听力及言语障碍；重者例如痉挛、神经错乱，最后死亡，至今仍无有效的治疗法。\n发病起三个月内约有半数重症者死亡，孕妇和胎儿亦会受到影响。\n## 原因\n1932年，Chisso（窒素即氮，该公司于2012年改名为「新日本窒素肥料」）于水俣工场生产氯乙烯与醋酸乙烯，其制程中需要使用含汞的催化剂。由于该工厂任意排放废水，这些含汞的剧毒物质流入成海，被水中生物所食用，并转成甲基氯汞（化学式CH3HgCl）与二甲汞（化学式(CH3)2Hg）等有机汞化合物。\n当人类捕食海中生物后，甲基汞等有机汞化合物通过鱼虾进入人体，被肠胃吸收，侵害脑部和身体其他部分，造成生物累积。\n## 发现经过\n1950年，有大量的海鱼成群在水俣湾海面游泳，任人网捕，海面上常见死鱼、海鸟尸体，水俣市的渔获量开始锐减。1952年，水俣当地许多猫只出现不寻常现象，走路颠颠跌跌，甚至发足狂奔，当地居民称「猫舞蹈病」，或直接称为「怪病」。1953年1月有猫发疯跳海自杀，但当时尚未引起注意，一年内，投海自杀的猫总数达五万多只。接著，狗、猪也发生了类似的发疯情形。1956年4月21日，人类亦被确认发生同样的症例，来自入江村的小女孩田中静子成为第一位患病者，被送至窒素公司（チッソ株式会社，「窒素」是指氮）附属医院，病况急速恶化，一个月后双眼失明，全身性痉挛，不久死亡。死者二岁的妹妹也罹患相同的病症，不久又发现许多村民都有问题。这些人开始只是口齿不清，走路不稳，最后高声大叫而死。医师细川一认为事态严重，向官方提出正式报告。当中的患者多为渔民家庭出身，1956年8月日本学者发现水俣湾海水中有污染物质，研究人员侦察的矛头指向窒素公司。这种怪病被称为「水俣奇病」。此事造成水俣近海鱼贝类市场价值一落千丈，水俣居民由于陷入贫困，反而大量食用有毒的鱼贝，使得灾情扩大。镇有4万居民，先后有1万人不同程度的患有此种病状。1957年8月水俣病患者家庭互助会成立。\n1959年，熊本大学医学部水俣病研究班发表研究报告，指出水俣病原因为当地窒素工场所排出的有机水银，1932至1968年间有数百吨的汞被排入水俣湾。1959年底，渔民开始向窒素公司进行示威抗议。1960年正式将「甲基汞中毒」所引起的工业公害病，定名为「水俣病」。然而，新日本窒素肥料立即否认此说，窒素公司认为：它只用金属汞，不用甲基汞，因此，不可能是水俣病的来源。工厂对事件处理相当消极，不但没有停止排放污水，还企图掩盖真相，阻挠相关的调查研究，甚至买通打手，以暴力吓阻。美国摄影师尤金·史密斯即被日本窒素公司所雇的暴民殴打，以至一目失明。日本政府于1968年左右乃确认两者之间的关系，但这样的迟误已造成灾害扩大。\n1966年新潟又爆发水俣病，史称「第二水俣病」，这次的祸首昭和电工仍企图逃避责任，但新潟市民对昭和公司不负责任的态度极为不满，展开激烈的示威抗争。1967年新潟市民正式向法院提出控诉。缠讼数年之后，1971年法院终于做成判决，昭和公司败诉，要负赔偿责任，新潟的受害者又主动与水俣市的苦主联手向法院控告窒素公司。1973年，法院判决窒素公司必须立即付出相当于3200万美元的赔偿金，被认定为水俣病的患者，可从政府及新日本窒素肥料取得相关医疗费用。两年内窒素公司一共赔出了八千万美元。由于病情认定是由政府处理，也产生是否涉入政治的疑问及批判。\n该事件被认为是一起重大的工业灾难。1997年10月，由官方所认定的受害者高达12,615人，当中有1,246人已死亡。"],

{"name": "筹算", "documents": ["## 筹算\n筹算（Rod calculus）是汉字文化圈古代使用算筹进行十进位制计算的程序。\n##历史\n筹算具体出现时间已然不可考，但根据典籍记录和考古发现，至少在战国初年筹算已然出现。它使用中国商代发明的十进位制计数，可以很方便地进行四则运算以及乘方，开方等较复杂运算，并可以对零、负数和分数作出表示与计算。\n筹算在公元6世纪由中国传入-{zh-cn:朝鲜半岛; zh-sg:韩国; zh-hant:韩国;}-和日本。七世纪的印度数学，分数中的分子在上，分母在下，与中国同，分数的乘除法也和《九章算术》相同。古印度数学绝大部分来自中国。。一直到被珠算完全取代之前，筹算是东亚古代进行日常计算的方法，算筹是东亚古代数学家研究数学时常用的计算器具，是东亚古代各种重要数学发明的基础，开创了中国以至东亚古代以计算为中心的机械化数学体系，与古希腊以逻辑推理为中心的数学体系有所不同；机械化的数学体系是一千多年世界数学的主流\n##影响\n筹算的乘除法传入印度，成为土盘算法。9世纪初至10世纪，又经印度传入阿拉伯,这时期的阿拉伯阐述印度数学的数学著作，诸如《印度算术原理》，其土盘算式虽然用阿拉伯数字表示，但其十进位制概念，分数的表示法，以及加、减、乘、除四则运算的计算方法，和中国的筹算雷同，有的还用空格“”表示“0”，和筹算一模一样。有学者认为，中国古代的筹算，通过丝绸之路传入印度、阿拉伯，促成印度－阿拉伯数字体系。\n##数字表示\n算筹数系是世界上唯一只用一个符号的方向和位置的组合，表示任何十进位数字或分数的系统。\n单位数字：将筹棍竖排一根棍表示1，两根棍表示2，5根棍表示5如图上。但从6至9数字的表示，不是并排6至9根筹棍，而是采用同位五进制，即用一根筹棍代表数码5，横放在筹数1至4的上方如图。这已蕴含算盘雏形。上排是筹算中1至9的竖码，下排是相应数字的横码。\n大于9的数字，则用十进制表示，在个位数的位置左边，放置一个筹数，代表这个筹数的十倍，在十位数值左的位置，代表百位数，如此类推。如图所示数二百三十一（231）的表示法，在个位放置一根筹码，表示1，在十位放置筹数3，代表30，在百位放置筹数2，代表200，总数即二百三十一（231）。《孙子算经》云：\n筹算板一般是桌面或地面，通常没有格子。如果筹码2，3，1并排排列，有可能被误读为51或24；为了避免邻位误读，每隔一位交替使用竖码横码，即个位竖码，十位用横码，百位用竖码，千位用横码，如此类推，就可以完全避免误读了。\n###零的表示\n中国自有筹算起就有“0”，即以空位表示“0”。筹算中的零是位置零和运算结果的零，没有特定符号，这和阿拉伯数字专有一个符号0不同，阿拉伯数字0只是符号零，不是运算结果。\n###正负数\n宋代数学家用红色筹码代表正数，用黑色筹码代表负数，也有一律用黑色筹码，但在数字最后一位加一根斜棍标示为负数。\n##小数\n孙子算经的度量衡已有十进位制概念，如尺、寸、分、厘、毫、丝、忽。七丈一尺二寸三分四厘五毫六丝，用现代表示方法为71.23456尺，用算筹排为\n其中为十分之一位等等。\n南宋秦九韶在《数书九章》中将小数推广到非度量衡，如\n1.1446154日\n表示为：\n日\n即在个位数1下记一“日”字。\n##加法\n算筹本身已经包含加法，因此用算筹进行加法运算十分方便快捷。筹算加法与阿拉伯数字加法最大的不同，在于算筹本身具有可加性，用算筹进行加法运算，只须机械地搬动筹棍，即可进行运算，不需要另外背诵加法表，这与阿拉伯数字不同，不可能将阿拉伯数字1和2机械地叠成3字，2和3叠成一个5字。\n左图表示的运筹步骤：\n上行被加数筹码，在运算过程中逐步变化；下行加数筹码，在运算过程中逐步消失。\n##减法\n不需向上一数量级借位的情况下，只要从被减数中去掉与减数相同数目的筹棍，剩余的筹码就是答案。左图为计算54-23的演示步骤。\n右图为计算4231-789的演示步骤，此情况即为需要向上一数量级借位：\n##乘法\n运用算筹进行乘除运算时必须先学会九九表:《夏侯阳算经》云：夫乘除之法，先明九九，一丛十横，百立千僵，千十相望，万百相当。满六已上，五在上方。六不积算，五不单张。上下相乘，实居中央。言十自当。已法除之，宜得上商，横算相当。以次右行，极于左方。\n《孙子算经》对筹算乘法有详细阐述。\n左图即为筹算38×76的演示步骤：\nP.S.:范例图片是一边乘一边加而不是像文字描述所说乘完后才加。\n##除法\n左图为计算的演示步骤：\n孙子除法在9世纪初最早由花拉子米从印度介绍到阿拉伯国家，十世纪阿拉伯数学家阿尔乌几里德《印度的算术》叙述的早期除法和十一世纪波斯数学家伊本·拉班《印度算术原理》叙述的除法，也是不折不扣的孙子除法：\n##分数\n用筹算进行除法运算时，如留有余数，则必须保留除数和余数，形成一对筹码，一在上一在下。刘徽《九章算术注》中，在上的筹称“实”，为在下的筹称为“法”：《孙子算经》中，在上的筹称为“子”，（分子），而在下的称为“母”（分母）。如右图一对筹码一在上一在下，1是子，7是母，构成分数 。\n这种筹算分数的表示法，在9世纪由花拉子米介绍到阿拉伯国家。\n###分数乘法\n此算法的实质是将带分数先化成假分数，再行乘法。\n###分数除法\n此算法的实质是将带分数先化成假分数，并将除数取倒数相乘。\n###最大公约数\n九章算术给出求两个数最大公约数的方法，即辗转相除，以至最后余数相等，即为最大公约数。\n左图为求  的最大公约数，并进行约分。\n最大公约数为25，约分得。\n###分数内插法\n何承天发明名为调日法的分数内插法，反复将弱值分数与强值分数的分子分母相加已求得更佳的近似值。祖冲之用此法求的著名的圆周率\n约率和密率\n##开平方根\n孙子算经卷中：“今有积，二十三万四千五百六十七步。问：为方几何？答曰：四百八十四步九百六十八分步之三百一十一。\n术曰：置积二十三万四千五百六十七步，为实，次借一算为下法，步之超一位至百而止。上商置四百于实之上，副置四万于实之下。下法之商，名为方法；命上商四百除实，除讫，倍方法，方法一退，下法再退，复置上商八十以次前商，副置八百于方法之下。下法之上，名为廉法；方廉各命上商八十以除实，除讫，倍廉法，从方法，方法一退，下法再退，复置上商四以次前，副置四于方法之下。下法之上，名曰隅法；方廉隅各命上商四以除实，除讫，倍隅法，从方法，上商得四百八十四，下法得九百六十八，不尽三百一十一，是为方四百八十四步九百六十八分步之三百一十一”。\n右图为筹算开方

早期筹算\n\n中国古代以筹为工具来记数、列式和进行各种数与式的演算的一种方法。筹，又称为策、筹策、算筹，后来又称之为算子。它最初是小竹棍一类的自然物，以后逐渐发展成为专门的计算工具，质地与制作也愈加精致。据文献记载,算筹除竹筹外,还有木筹、铁筹、骨筹、玉筹和牙筹，并且有盛装算筹的算袋和算子筒。算筹实物已在陕西、湖南、江苏、河北等省发现多批。其中发现最早的是1971年陕西千阳出土的西汉宣帝时期的骨制算筹。 筹算在中国肇源甚古，春秋战国时期的《老子》中就有“善数者不用筹策”的记述。当时算筹已作为专门的计算工具被普遍采用，并且筹的算法已趋成熟。\n\n### 文献记载\n\n《汉书·律历志》中有关于算筹的形状与大小的记载：“其算法用竹，径一分，长六寸，二百七十一枚而成六觚,为一握。”西汉算筹一般是直径为0.23厘米,长约13.86厘米的圆形竹棍,把二百七十一枚筹捆成六角形的捆。而《隋书·律历志》称：“其算用竹,广二分,长三寸。正策三廉,积二百一十六枚成六觚,干之策也。负策四廉，积一百四十四枚成方，坤之策也。”到了隋代，算筹已是三棱形与四棱形两种，以区别正数与负数。其广约为0.59厘米，长约8.85厘米。这表明从汉到隋，算筹从圆而方，由长变短，以便运用。魏刘徽注《九章算术》称：“正算赤,负算黑,否则以邪正为异。“又《梦溪笔谈》卷八称：”算法用赤筹、黑筹，以别正负之数。“可见早在三国以前，中算家便已用筹的颜色的赤、黑或形状的邪、正（三棱形和四棱形）来区分正、负数了。\n算筹记数的规则，最早载于《孙子算经》：“凡算之法，先识其位。一纵十横,百立千僵。千、十相望,万、百相当。”用算筹表示数目有纵、横两种方式： 中国古代的筹算不仅是正、负整数与分数的四则运算和开方，而且还包含着各种特定筹式的演算。中算家不仅利用筹码不同的“位”来表示不同的“值”，发明了十进位值制记数法，而且还利用筹在算板上各种相对位置排列成特定的数学模式，用以描述某种类型的实际应用问题。例如列衰、盈朒、“方程”诸术所列筹式描述了实际中常见的比例问题和线性问题；天元、四元及开方诸式，则刻画了高次方程问题；而大衍求一术则是为“乘率”而设计的特殊筹式。筹式以不同的位置关系表示特定的数量关系。在这些筹式所规定的不同“位”上，可以布列任意的数码（它们随着实际问题的不同而取不同的数值），因而，中国古代的筹式本身就具有代数符号的性质。可以认为，是一种独特的符号系统。 中国古代的筹算表现为算法的形式，而具有模式化、程序化的特征。中国的筹算不用运算符号，无须保留运算的中间过程，只要求通过筹式的逐步变换而最终获得问题的解答。因此，中国古算中的“术”，都是用一套一套的“程序语言”所描写的程序化算法，并且中算家经常将其依据的算理蕴涵于演算的步骤之中，起到“不言而喻，不证自明”的作用。可以说“寓理于算”是古代筹算在表现形式上的又一特点。\n\n算筹是在珠算发明以前中国独创并且是最有效的计算工具。中国古代数学的早期发达与持续发展是受惠于筹的。\n\n## 西藏筹算\n\n### 珍贵文化\n\n一种文化穿越了千年，在骈体歌谣般的吟唱声里把现场所有人的心引进了藏民族特定的智慧里。2011年5月23日，拉萨市政协民族会议室里，专家及学者齐聚一堂，拉萨市档案馆抢救西藏古老筹算文化演算会在这里召开。\n\n### 保护措施\n\n据了解，西藏古老筹算是非常独特的计算方法，早在吐蕃松赞干布时期已用法律的形式规定了各种度量衡的计算单位。距今已有上千年的历史，五世达赖时期，由堆琼巴·阿南达所著《筹算理论萨嘎杰研究》问世后，又进一步规范和统一了西藏古老的筹算理论和方法。\n目前，全市甚至全区知晓和运用该筹算的人已寥寥无几，为及时抢救西藏古老筹算文化，今天拉萨市档案馆特邀请相关专家举办西藏古老筹算演算会，重温古代的各种度量衡并重新制作筹算器具及计算盘、各种算筹等。在向外界展示同时还要制作各种影像资料加以保存。古西藏的各类度量衡和筹算的产生与运用，表明古西藏的先祖是聪明和智慧的，这种古老的筹算方式产生及运用为西藏的政治、经济、文化各方面的发展做出了卓越的贡献，是祖国文化宝库中藏民族的宝贵文化瑰宝，更是不可再生的历史档案。\n为了及时抢救这一文化遗产拉萨市档案馆自2010年起就开始走访原地方政府“孜康勤空”（审计署）工作过的老同志、知晓西藏古老筹算文化的区、市两级政协委员及自治区社科院诺张伍金先生，西藏大学的有关专家等做了大量工作。拉萨市档案馆抢救西藏古老筹算文化档案这一举措，不但丰富了馆藏而且也从另一个侧面体现了拉萨市档案馆特色馆藏的价值。\n三位专家在精心演算，观看的人们更为屏气凝神，现场没有一点余音，只有古朴及历史久远的回响，充溢着所有的空间、白发学者、古老的演算方式，与是古老与现代发展与传承在这里突显的尤为重要与迫切了。\n\n## 数字表示\n\n一到九的直型态与横型态对照\n算筹数系是世界上唯一只用一个符号的方向和位置的组合，表示任何十进位数字或分数的系统。 单位数字：将筹棍竖排一根棍表示1，两根棍表示2，5根棍表示5如图1上。但从6至9数字的表示，不是并排6至9根筹棍，而是采用同位五进制，即用一根筹棍代表数码5，横放在筹数1至4的上方如图1。这已蕴含算盘雏形。上排是筹算中1至9的竖码，下排是相应数字的横码。\n使用直横排列避免混淆\n大于9的数字，则用十进制表示，在个位数的位置左边，放置一个筹数，代表这个筹数的十倍，在十位数值左的位置，代表百位数，如此类推。如图2所示数二百三十一（231）的表示法，在个位放置一根筹码，表示1，在十位放置筹数3，代表30，在百位放置筹数2，代表200，总数即二百三十一（231）。《孙子算经》云：\n凡算之法：先识其位，一从十横，百立千僵，千十相望，万百相当\n\n。\n筹算板一般是桌面或地面，通常没有格子。如果筹码2，3，1并排排列，有可能被误读为51或24；为了避免邻位误读，先民发明了每隔一位交替使用竖码横码，即个\n位竖码，十位用横码，百位用竖码，千位用横码，如此类推，就可以完全避免误读了。\n\n### 零的表示\n\n数字后加斜棍表负数\n中国自有筹算起就有“0”，即以空位表示“0”。筹算中的零是位置零和运算结果的零，没有特定符号。\n\n### 正负数\n\n宋代数学家用红色筹码代表正数，用黑色筹码代表负数，也有一律用黑色筹码，但在数字最后一位加一根斜棍标示为负数。\n\n## 耐普洱算筹\n\n十七世纪初叶，英国数学家耐普尔发明的一种算筹计算法。明末介绍到我国，也称“筹算”。清代梅文鼎、戴震曾加以研究，戴震称为策算。筹是用竹或木制成的，一至九每筹正反面各分九格，每格斜分为二，个位数写于斜线下角，十位数写于斜线上角。第一筹正面写一至九，第二筹写一至九各数的二倍的数，第三到第九各筹中，分别写一至九各数的三倍至九倍的数，第一筹的反面与第九筹同，其他筹类此。第五筹的反面为空。计算时把筹拼拢，进行乘除。清代梅文鼎改斜格为两半圆合一位格，比较醒目。后来又将横筹改为纵筹，更为方便。又有平方筹、立方筹等专为开方之用。\n\n## 纳皮尔算筹\n\nnapier suanchou，亦称“纳皮尔计算尺”。一种能简化计算的乘法速算器，由英国数学家、对数的发明人纳皮尔发明。如图3，它由十根木条组成，每根木条上都刻有数码，右边第一根木条是固定的，其余的都可以根据计算的需要进行拼合和调换位置。这种算筹可以用加法和一位数乘法代替多位数的乘法，也可以用除数为一位数的除法和减法代替多位数的除法，从而简化了计算。其计算原理的“格子乘法”。例如，要计算934×314，首先将9，3，4和3，1，4摆成如图4所示，遇到对角线上的两上数字就加在一起，这就容易得到934分别乘以3，1，4的结果为2802，934和3736，然后再错位相加，就得到所要求的结果293276。这种简单的计算器，在当时很受欢迎，流行了许多年。在清代与笔算、比例规算法等一起传入中国，北京故宫博物院至今还藏有此算筹。 17世纪初，计算工具在西方呈现了较快的发展。首先创立对数概念 闻名于世的英国数学家纳皮尔（J.Napier），在他所著的一本书里，介绍了一种新工具， 即后来被称为“纳皮尔算筹”的器具。纳皮尔出身在苏格兰一个贵族家庭，13岁就进入圣安德鲁斯大学学习。作为一个天文爱好者， 他曾醉心于钻研占星术，自然而然进入到数学计算的领域。纳皮尔想过许多办法来简化天文数值计算， 终于在1614年提出了对数的概念， 成为与17世纪出现的解析几何、微积分一样重要的数学方法，纳皮尔也因此一举成名。据说，纳皮尔的这种器具发明于1612年，它由一些长条状的木棍组成，木棍的表面雕刻着类似于乘法表的数字。纳皮尔用它来帮助进行乘法计算，他根据乘数和被乘数排列好木棍的顺序，仅需要做简单的加法就能计算出乘积，从而大大简化了数值计算过程。纳皮尔算筹与中国的算筹在原理上大相径庭，它已经显露出对数计算方法特征。\n\n纳皮尔开创的对数概念影响了一代数学家，英国牧师奥却德（W.Oughtred）就是其中的佼佼者。虽然这位牧师后来爬到了主教的位置，仍然把全部业余时间花在数学上，甚至一天只睡二三个小时。他发明的乘法符号“×”一直沿用至今。",

武当派\n\n网游《新天龙八部》十四大门派之一\n\n武当派创立于湖北省武当山，为内家之宗，起于宋而兴于明。\n据明末清初黄宗羲的《王征南墓志铭》所述，武当派为宋人张三丰所创立。\n武当派的功法特点是强筋骨、运气功。强调内功修练，讲究以静制动，以柔克刚，以短胜长，以慢击快、以意运气，以气运身，偏于阴柔，主呼吸，用短手，武当功法不主进攻，然而亦不可轻易侵犯。\n有一种说法是之后的太极拳、八卦掌、形意拳等等内家拳均是从武当内家拳繁衍发展而成。## 门派背景\n\n亘古无双胜境，天下第一仙山。\n武当山集幽、奇、秀、美为一体，四季风光不同，景色各异。自南北朝起这里就有众多武林中人隐修于此，武当派最初只是在此修道隐居之人的松散朋党。\n自第一代天师起，武当越来越紧密的成为江湖上难以忽视的派别，近几十年更是可以和少林相提并论，隐隐有武林领袖的风范。\n武当派并非道观，却深喑道法，收藏众多道学经典。皇上欲修《道经》，就选取了声名渐隆的武当山。\n掌门为张三丰。\n\n## 门派特色\n\n### 战斗特色\n\n武当道法深厚、武功博大雄浑，内功位列十大门派之首。\n同时道家弟子的武功中有玄功的成分，对他们的攻击进一步加强。\n武当弟子典型的仙风道骨，作战也是风度翩翩，攻敌于百步之外，同时可以移形换位，几乎做到敌不沾身。面对狂暴的敌人，他们还可以通过道家玄法，牢牢的把敌人定在脚下、不得动弹。所以多么穷凶极恶的敌人也不敢在武当弟子面前造次。\n在群体对敌的过程中，武当弟子总是一剑定江山的领军人物\n\n###

炼丹\n\n炼丹之风，百年前曾风靡神州，僧俗道皆有修炼。武当弟子修道，且比之游方术士更有炼丹的本事。一方面武当百年来经验积累，另一方面炼丹与修炼密不可分，武当武学也是与炼丹之术相辅相成的。\n\n### 道法\n\n炼丹如果剥去金石采集、燃火练化的过程，炼丹食丹之人本身也需要有很好的道法修为、吐纳真法，方才保证金丹确实有想要的效果。\n\n### 乘鹤\n\n御鹤成仙，本是修炼得道的标志。但上一代李天师，偏偏自极北苦寒之地寻来灵鹤幼鸟，精心饲养。武当仙鹤，不再迁徙，且可让身轻之人骑乘。武当弟子乘鹤下山，往往被寻常百姓惊为天人。\n\n##

"武当派是中土武术门派之一，按照金庸武侠小说《倚天屠龙记》说法，张三丰为少林觉远大师的徒弟、师徒因违反少林不准擅自学武的禁令，被赶了出来，后来他根据少林功法变通，且自创内家拳，开山立派，武当由此立足于江湖。武当为内家之宗，在武林中与「少林派」齐名，同被誉为「武林中的泰山北斗」。1958年出版的卧龙生成名作《飞燕惊龙》中，即有武当派的描述，并列入「九大门派」之中。\n武当武术一度在文学作品中被描绘得神乎其技，人们通常把这种练习内功为主的拳法称为「内家拳」；武当道士们所创的武当武术中，蕴含着珍爱生命的传统哲理，小说家们将太极、阴阳、五行、八卦等哲学理论用于拳理、拳技、练功原则和技击战术中，组成一个庞大的武当武系。\n\n## 门派介绍\n\n武当派传说中的开山祖师是元、明之际的张三丰，他的生平众说纷纭，大致说来，他是辽东懿州人，本名是张全一，一名「君宝」，号「三丰」，因为不修边幅，又被称为「张邋遢」。他天资聪敏，过目不忘，与人言谈，专以道德、仁义、忠孝为本，并无虚诞欺诳于人，因而修练成「心与神通，神与道一，事事皆有先见之理」的境地。平时行止不定，或穿山走石或铺云卧雪，所以人们视他为神仙中人。\n武当与少林派两派在武侠小说中均有着相当重要的地位，一直都有「北崇少林，南尊武当」的说法，这两派也常联合起来主持武林正义。两者的不同除了分属佛道两种宗教信仰外，少林寺的地理位置是较明确的，武当派就只说是在武当山上，这或许是因为武当山上的知名道观多，却没有像是少林寺这般将宗教与武学相结合的单位。\n\n按金庸的武侠小说《倚天屠龙记》，张三丰为少林觉远大师的徒弟、师徒因违犯少林不准擅自学武的禁令，被赶了出来，后来他根据少林功法变通，且自创内家拳，自成一家，称武当派。武当为内家之宗，在武林中与少林派齐名。\n\n《新天龙八部》武当山\n\n##

武当武术\n\n## 武当宝剑\n\n●「太乙分光剑」：\n武当派心明神尼与师弟灵灵子合练之宝，按武当派所传《炼魔剑诀》炼成。曾仗以清理武当门户。（还珠楼主《蜀山剑侠传》）\n●「青牛剑」：\n昆仑派半边老尼参悟玄妙，以太上坐骑青牛为形，采五金之精所炼成的异宝，准备将来传授给自己的七个得意女弟子，昆仑七姊妹。炼成之后从未伤过生物。异派能手「金针圣母」曾借以兵解。（还珠楼主《蜀山剑侠传》）\n●「金牛剑」：\n系武当派镇派之宝。乃是一柄长约七寸，镶嵌金兽头的宝剑。放在剑匣中，隐隐有光华闪动，威力至大。后被武当教祖半边大师赐给得意弟子，「姑射仙」林绿华。（还珠楼主《蜀山剑侠传》）\n●「真武剑」（宝剑）：\n一代宗师张三丰的佩剑，形式奇古，锋锐无比。张三丰中年时用它扫荡群邪，威震江湖，晚年则极少使用。此剑向来是武当派镇山之宝，曾被魔教「日月神教」盗去，任盈盈出任教主后归还给当代掌门冲虚道长。（见金庸《笑傲江湖》）\n●「白龙剑」：\n「绵里针」陆菲青所用，曲折如意，相当于软剑。（金庸《书剑恩仇录》）\n●「凝碧剑」：\n利器，武当叛徒「火手判官」张召重所用。（金庸《书剑恩仇录》）\n●「七星剑」：\n武当掌门人石雁的佩剑。（古龙《幽灵山庄》）\n●七柄利剑：\n昔年徐鲁子徐大师，铸剑之术，天下无双，他曾应武当第七代掌门之邀，以西方精铁之英，用武当解剑池的水，铸成了七柄利剑，由掌门人传给门下剑术最高的七大弟子，人在剑在，死后才交回掌门收执。 （古龙《三少爷的剑》）\n●「腾蛟剑」：\n此剑用东北产的白金精炼而成，锋利无比，屈伸如意，可以当作腰带围在腰间，也可卷成一卷握在手里。（见梁羽生《七剑下天山》、《冰魄寒光剑》）\n●「苍木龙纹古剑」：\n武当镇山古剑。（温瑞安《血河车》）\n●「紫虚剑」：\n当代武当掌门大风道长的兵刃。（温瑞安《血河车》）\n●「沉沙古剑」：\n这柄巨剑规矩是只有掌门人能得见，在武当的铁箱遗物之中有本小册子，记录著本门各种宝物，这沉沙古剑名列首位，下面还注明此剑重达七七四十九斤，乃是本门上好几代一位前辈高手采集海底寒铁铸成，剑身特别长大，两边剑刃都未开锋发刃，但因铁质异于凡金，所以有裂石开碑的威力，此剑剑身上刻有剑谱秘诀，但玄奥难解，而且剑身过于沉重，倘非天生神力过人，万难使用。故此历代祖师都任得此剑供藏在武当禁地「星沉谷天龙湖」边的「长生岩」秘府之内。（司马翎《铁柱云旗》）\n●「朱雀剑」：\n「五行宝剑」之一，乃是春秋时代铸成的宝剑，名唤「朱雀」，玄机子早年在武当后山，无意得到。剑鞘和剑身俱到有古篆，原来是极为离奇的剑法，称为「离火剑诀」，配合起上乘内家真力和剑法，别有出奇的威力。玄机子仗着这口「朱雀剑」，曾和当代武当掌门黄鹤真人，在秘室中较量了两个时辰，终于黄鹤真人认败服输。（司马翎《剑气千幻录》）\n●「地煞潜龙剑」：\n武当山「天风观」的「金须道长」张涵清镇观之宝。这是一柄削钢斩铁、切金断玉的宝剑。绿鲨鱼皮鞘，金吞口，黄绒挽手，剑出鞘时，呛啷声音清脆、悠长，声似龙吟，剑身颤动，寒光闪闪，耀人眼目。（见郑证因《鹰爪王》）\n●「寒英剑」：\n乃当代三神刃之一，武当镇山之宝，与「含光剑」、「七星剑」，同称三绝，剑身发出蒙蒙青虹，难以分辨剑身是虹，抑或青虹是剑，令人望之，只觉彻体生寒。（云中岳《剑海情涛》）\n●「玄武剑」：\n是武当派镇山之剑，乃当代武当掌门青阳真人数十年用惯了的趁手兵刃。（东方玉《北山惊龙》）\n●「武当三剑」：\n「太极真武剑」、「紫霄纯阳剑」、「太乙拂尘剑」，这三口剑皆是道家「隐仙派」历代所传信物，其后一一收归于张三丰之手，供奉于「真武观」中，遂给人合称为「武当三剑」。「隐仙派」早已没落，如今精华全在武当一派。（孙晓《英雄志》）\n\n## 暗器\n\n●「芙蓉金针」：\n（见金庸《书剑恩仇录》）\n●「一手七暗器」：\n乃是「武当七绝」第三绝，能够一手同时发出七种形状不同、重量不同的暗器，那七种暗器又能够同时击中目标的一种暗器手法。（黄鹰《天蚕变》）\n\n## 师门重宝\n\n●「骊珠镯」：\n武当一件祖传照明之宝。（司马翎《铁柱云旗》）\n●「紫府金盂」：\n乃是玄门至宝，派中历代相传，能够自生清水，此水具有清灵之气，效力自比寒潭中阴寒之水更胜一筹。用来盛放瓜果，不但可以保持新鲜，而且分外鲜美。（司马翎《铁柱云旗》）\n●秘府图：\n一块径尺大的白玉板，版上朱痕纵横，是武当山禁地「星沉谷天龙湖」边的「长生岩」秘府中出入道路地图。那禁地秘府规定除了武当掌门人以外，旁人不得进入。秘府内有许多失传的练功法门。（司马翎《铁柱云旗》）\n●「千载灵芝」：\n观后有一座深谷，名曰「千药」，其中栽了两本罕世灵草，称为「千载灵芝」。这两本灵芝功效通神，有起死人活白骨之神效，不过这千载灵芝非是凡物，要采以炼药，大有困难，天下间只有那玄门至宝「紫府金盂」能够盛载炼药。（司马翎《铁柱云旗》）\n●「榔梅实」：\n乃是梅树榔树的变种。相传元帝为武当插梅寄榔。成此异种奇树。花如桃杏，蒂间垂丝，实如金橘，里白如玉，剖开时金玉相映，乃是果中珍名，这玩意据说可治百病，武当至宝龙虎护心丹，就有这珍果在内作引，不知确否。（云中岳《霸海风云》）\n●「人皮宝衣」：\n是武林中数百年谣传的「武当派绝艺秘宝」，干薄人皮制成的宝衣，上载武当创始人张三丰的武艺精华，药物所写，遇火才现。但一年之后即会全部湮没。习者必须在一年之内全部默记字画，再刻苦勤练五年，定必一鸣惊人。（详见兰立《剑底游龙》）\n\n## 药物\n\n解毒：「天心解毒丹」\n内伤：「白虎夺命丹」、「天王护心丹」、「九转小还丹」、「龙虎护心丹」、「大还丹」、「夺命金丹」\n外伤：「三黄宝腊丸」\n\n## 阵法\n\n●「真武七截阵」：\n张三丰从真武神像座前的蛇山、龟山，心想这一龟一蛇正是兼收至重至灵的两件物性，竟从中创制出一套精妙无方的武功出来。然而，从大气磅礴的龟、蛇二山山势演化而来的武功决非一人之力能同时施为。于是他传了七位弟子每人一套武功，各有精微奥妙之处，若二人合力，则攻守兼备，威力大增。若三人同使，比二人同使的威力又强一倍。四人相当于八位高手，五人相当于十六位，六人相当于三十二位，七人相当于六十四位当世一流高手同时出手。（见金庸《倚天屠龙记》）\n●「九宫八卦剑阵」：\n是以九个精通「连环夺命剑法」的人，按着九宫八卦方位布成的，武当派的「连环剑法」本以迅捷绵密见长，若是九个精通「连环夺命剑法」的人同使，那就简直没有半点空隙，连苍蝇也飞不过的。（见梁羽生《云海玉弓缘》）\n●「五行剑阵」：\n有五人组成一阵，联手拒敌，但那五人组成的剑势，其威力却不是五人加起来的威力，其妙处在全出其长，尽掩其短，五人之力，应该倍数乘之。五人组成的剑阵，其威力等于五五二十五人联手之力。这算计之法，也不知是出自何人之口，但却广传于江湖之上，人人皆知。武当派中的五行剑阵，因为需要人手不多，极易组成，而且变化亦不似少林罗汉阵那等复杂，但他们联手合攻的剑招。却是凌厉辛辣。武当派就凭这剑势，争得江湖上第一剑派之名。（卧龙生《天剑绝刀》）\n●「千针迷心阵」：\n由多名道人从皮囊中抽出体积细小的钢针，迅快向目标扬去，大有无孔不入之势。（司马翎《铁柱云旗》）\n●「连环剑阵」：\n此法不传俗家弟子，凡是出家的门下弟子只要三个人凑在一起，就可施展这种剑阵，运起秘传心法，互相抱住腰身，三人内力溶汇于一体，挺剑向敌人冲去，当者披靡，赵岳就曾经被这种奇特威猛的功夫冲杀得无从招架，几乎落败惨死。（司马翎《铁柱云旗》）\n●「北斗七星剑阵」：\n「北斗七星阵」又叫「天罡剑阵」，乃是以天上北斗七星方位排列，再配合阴阳变化而成。这七星都有名字，由左边起数，是天枢、天璇、天玑、天权、玉衡、开阳、瑶光，一至四是斗魁，又叫璇玑，五至七是斗柄，或者叫做玉衡。枢为天璇为地，玑为人，权为时，玉衡为音，开阳为律，瑶光为星成斗状排列，居阴布阳，变成阵，就犹如常山之蛇，击首尾应，击尾首应，击其中则首尾呼应，到最后一个变化，枢璇相合，天地交往，就是玉石俱焚，万劫不复之势。（黄鹰《天蚕变》）\n●「七星剑阵」：\n七星剑阵变化奇奥绝伦，看去是二十八支剑同时攻到，其实全不是那么回事，真正近身的只有四支。每一组的另六名道士，不是将剑搭在同伴的剑上，就是左掌按在身侧同伴的后心上了。这是玄门「分身导力」的超凡绝学，四十九人的内力，攻向一点，血肉之躯如何禁受得起？铜墙铁壁也挡不住这全力一击！（云中岳《剑海情涛》）\n●「大五行剑阵」：\n武当派闻名江湖的剑阵。二十五位道人，五个一组，像一朵梅花似的列成阵式，把敌人围在中间，剑阵流动，二十五支长剑，汇成一片精芒，同时出手，密不透风，威力无穷。「大五行剑阵」下少有人余生。（见东方玉《北山惊龙》）\n●「五行百步剑阵」：\n七十二位剑士，围着圈子游走不停，每个人沉势哈腹，长剑内指。像一团气流，旋风般的狂卷。（见萧瑟《追云搏电录》）\n●「九子连环阵」：\n天下闻名的四大阵式之一，厉害无比，难以攻破。（见萧瑟《白帝青后》）\n●「九宫仙阵」：\n乃是武当派的镇山之宝，与「少林罗汉阵」齐名。九人站立的方位尽皆不同，隐然组成了一种极为奇妙的阵法。少林派的罗汉阵乃是聚合阵中十八人的力量为一体，从而产生出人力所不可达到的大威能，从而克敌制胜。这九人合成的阵法，阵中每个人的真气却散布得清清楚楚的，有高有低，相互夹杂，并不混合勾结。但九人之间却形成了种极为和谐的关系，犹如音律一般，丝丝入扣，穷极天工，虽彼此独立，却又连横制约，成一整体。（见步非烟《武林客栈》）\n\n##

武当派\n武当派是集合晚清时期至民国初年之传说，与及小说资料所影响，而形成之为江湖武术门派。\n首先在民国初年杨式太极拳传人说太极拳即是刘宋时期(420—479年)武当丹士朴阳子张三丰所传之内家拳。杨家太极杨澄甫(杨露禅之孙)在民国初年所著的《太极拳体用全书》，在自序中说：“先大父更诏之日，太极拳创自宋末张三丰，传之者，为王宗岳、陈州同、张松溪、蒋发诸人相承不绝。陈长兴师，乃蒋发惟一之弟子。”\n中国武术的早期发展多半缺乏文字记载，仅能靠师徒口耳相传。而古时的武林人士和现今的武术界大多十分重视武德，并首重「尊师重道」，绝不可「欺师灭祖」，故于传承武艺时，必先向弟子说明其师承之源流，代代相传，即使日后另立门户/门派，亦不可忘本 (祖师源流)。现今广为流传的部份太极拳门派，如杨家、吴家、李家等都有源自武当张三丰之说法。\n据清徐道等述赞的《神仙鉴》(原名《三教同原录》)载：“刘宋时有张三峰者，号朴阳子。未入道时，曾授人以房中御女方。天帝恶之，终于草岛游仙。何一阳仙姑游华山，曾见其金丹秘诀，悉务于身。因无天诏，难升玉阙，深慨惜焉。”\n1921年许禹生书刊开始改称太极拳是宋元时期道士张三丰所创。相传之武当派开山祖师张三丰，本名张君宝，生于1247年(元定宗二年四月初九日、南宋理宗七年元)，于1366年(元惠宗三年九月二十二日)，于陕西宝鸡金台观去世。\n但据现存武当派各分支派及武当山道教中人相传，武当派开山祖师张三丰 ，本名张全一，字玄玄，元明之际著名道士，辽东懿州人。于湖北均县武当山修道，供奉玄天上帝为主神。因玄天上帝，本名玄武大帝，故武当派亦称为玄武派，是武当山的本山派系。由于他是辽东懿州人，因此，武当派在辽东留下一脉支派，称为三丰自然派。\n##清末直隶军中武术\n清末直隶清军中武术，亦是后来袁世凯新军中所习的拳术，后直系军阀承继之。包括了太极拳、心意六合拳(发展出形意拳)、八卦掌、八极拳。\n## 近代对武当拳派源流、拳系及内容之研究\n由武汉体育学院武术系主任、教授、著名武术家江百龙先生领导、组织的课题科研组，对国家体委委管课题研究项目《武当拳派源流、拳系及内容研究》，历时三年的研究，于1992年8月1日，在武当山紫霄饭店宣讲论文进行鉴定。 参加鉴定的是由国家体委组织的二十余名全国武术界著名的专家、学者、教授、武术大师，对该课题的《武当拳派祖师张三丰之生平》、《武当拳派之渊源》、《武当拳派之理论基础》、《武当拳派之技击内容》，进行了认真鉴定，一致认为：张三丰确有其人，武当山确有其拳，武当拳派是与少林拳派齐名的中国内家拳。这次对武当拳派的高层次高水准的研究，出了专著《武当拳之研究》，并在国家体委获奖。\n国家体委科研课题《武当拳派源流、拳系及内容研究》工作，编撰《武当拳之研究》，发表《武当拳探源》、《武当拳与道教理论的联系》等多篇武当武术论文，汇集了当前赞同“张三丰的太极拳祖师地位”的武术学者有关“武当武术”和“张三丰”研究的主要观点，透视出了这些学者的研究方向和学术层面。\n##现时之武当派\n现在所称之武当派或内家拳，当出自武禹襄之后。拳种为当时北京天津直隶一带之地方武术，混合了长拳、炮捶、红拳、太极拳、八卦掌、形意拳等。\n武当派建国后的道总：\n第一任道总：阮蓬志（道号仙境子）1984-1987年在任\n第二任道总：王光德（道号通圣）1987-2001年在任\n第三任道总：李光富 (道号诚道)2001-至今\n##门派分支与人物承传\n道教武当门派分支众多。粗分南武当北武当之外，分全真龙门派﹑正一派﹑真武玄武门/玄武派、三丰自然派、...等七八个分支。\n也因为跟多位师父学习不同武术，加上1989年恢复玄武派，一人同时承传两派功夫也是常见。 正式拜师入门嘅入室弟子比俗家弟子承传更多更深入，而且包含拳术以外的哲学﹑宗教﹑医术﹑秘传知识等。\n其中传武当武术或太极拳的历代师徒人数也众多。很多正式上山修道者很少接触传媒甚至互联网，不为外人知道。\n暂时列举相关人物多系开班授徒﹑任职高位﹑名人之师父﹑已推出书本或录像影碟﹑参加武术交流大会或表演者。\n即使同一门派分支，近代人跟多位师父学习，融会贯通加创新，每代武当太极拳也会出现一点增删变化或改进。\n###玄武派\n相传武当派开山祖师张三丰，于湖北均县武当山修道，供奉玄天上帝为主神 (宋元时，皇室封号武当山真武神)，因玄天上帝，本名玄武大帝，故武当派亦称为「玄武派」，是武当山的本山派系。 玄武派因为历史原因曾经中断。1989年农历九月九日，武当山道教协会决定恢复「武当玄武派」。武当玄武派承接原来第十二代，恢复承接的第一代为第十三代弟子，第二代由1986年阴历正月初一开始。\n武当玄武派弟子辈份排行用字：\n宣渊一道志，求德振常存，照应通玄理，微希太景成，武当兴法派，惟仙尊之宗，大岳气自然，五龙呈祥烟，玉虚宏图展，三丰丹技传，南岩捧圣真，紫霄永吉昌。\n###三丰派\n武当三丰派承传徒弟辈份用字

武侠小说中之武当派\n武当派是中土武术宗派之一。武当武学一度在文学作品中被描绘得神乎其技，人们通常把这种练习内功为主的拳法称为内家拳。武当道士们所创的武当武学中，蕴含著珍爱生命的传统哲理，小说家们将太极、阴阳、五行、八卦等哲学理论用于拳理、拳技、练功原则和技击战术中，组成一个庞大的武当武系。\n武当派传说中的开山祖师是元、明之际的张三丰，他的生平众说纷纭，大致说来，他是辽东懿州人，本名是张全一，一名君宝，号三丰，因为不修边幅，又被称为张邋遢。他天资聪敏，过目不忘，与人言谈，专以道德、仁义、忠孝为本，并无虚诞欺诳于人，因而修练成「心与神通，神与道一，事事皆有先见之理」的境地。平时行止不定，或穿山走石或铺云卧雪，所以人们视他为神仙中人。\n武当与少林两派在武侠小说中均有著相当重要的地位，一直都有「北崇少林，南尊武当」的说法，这两派也常联合起来主持武林正义。两者的不同除了分属佛道两种宗教信仰外，少林寺的地理位置是较明确的，武当派就只说是在武当山上，这或许是因为武当山上的知名道观多，却没有像是少林寺这般将宗教与武学相结合的单位。\n### 金庸小说\n按金庸的武侠小说《倚天屠龙记》，张三丰为少林觉远大师的徒弟、师徒因违犯少林不准打杂的擅自学武的禁令而逃了出来，后来他根据少林功法变通，且自创内家拳，自成一家，称武当派。武当为内家之宗，在武林中与少林齐名。\n####武当派绝学\n共有一十三记招数，每记招式各不相同，但所刺之处，全是敌人手腕的神门穴。神门穴在手掌后瑞骨之端，敌人中剑后，手掌便再也使不出半点力道。\n使用时以浑厚内力逼弯剑刃，长剑竟似变成了一条软带，轻柔曲折，飘忽不定，剑招闪烁无常，敌人难以招架。\n此剑术一经发动就连绵不断，在一招之后，不论对方如何招架退避，第二招顺势跟着就来，如柔丝不断，春云绵绵。\n手法以掌为主，运转舒展如绵，动作连而不断，掌法运行成环，劲力要求内蓄刚劲，外现绵柔，爆发时迅速、快捷。\n合于八卦之数；在行掌时，要求以摆扣步走圆形，将八个方位全都走到，而不像一般拳术那样，或来去一条线，或走四角，所以称为“八卦掌”。\n劲贯双臂，大喝一声，双掌推出。\n从武当派擒拿手法虎爪手变化而来，却是招招拿人腰眼，能使敌人损阴绝嗣。\n堪称轻功中的轻功，其注重身法的轻灵，不以步法多变来迷惑对手，要旨是身形轻巧，高低进退自如。\n张三丰从真武神像座前的蛇山、龟山，心想这一龟一蛇正是兼收至重至灵的两件物性，竟从中创制出一套精妙无方的武功出来。然而，从大气磅礴的龟、蛇二山山势演化而来的武功决非一人之力能同时施为。于是他传了七位弟子每人一套武功，各有精微奥妙之处，若二人合力，则攻守妆备，威力大暗。若三人同使，比二人同使的威力又强一倍。四人相当于八位高手，五人相当于十六位，六人相当于三十二位，七人相当于六十四位当世一流高手同时出手。\n张三丰悟自倚天屠龙二十四字所创的神妙笔法，七侠中只有张翠山习得\n集道家武学之大成的剑法，讲究神在剑先，绵绵不绝，以不变应万变。\n集道家武学之大成的拳法，讲究太极圆转，永无止境，用意而不用力。\n张三丰年轻时所用的《真武剑》﹝笑傲江湖﹞"],

{"name": "不周山", "documents": ["## 不周山\n不周山是中国上古传说中的一座山，亦是人间的天柱，被共工在一气之下撞断，使天崩塌，后才衍伸出女娲补天的故事。根据古书记载，不周山据说在昆仑山西北。有提及「不周山」的书籍有《山海经·大荒西经》、屈原的《离骚》等。\n##流行文化\n在电脑游戏《仙剑奇侠传4》中，不周山场景作为通往鬼界的结点而出现在游戏中。", "不周山是中国古代神话传说中的山名，最早见于《山海经·大荒西经》：“西北海之外，大荒之隅，有山而不合，名曰不周。\n\n”据王逸注《离骚》，高周注《淮南子·道原训》均考不周山在昆仑山西北。相传不周山是人界唯一能够到达天界的路径，但不周山终年寒冷，长年飘雪，非凡夫俗子所能徒步到达。不周山具体在哪里有多种说法，最常见的说法是帕米尔高原。\n\n## 词语释义\n\n不，表否定；周，周全，完整；山，高于地平面的自然隆起。不周山，就是不完整的山。这山一有名字，就不完整。共工氏怒触不周山，怒触的时候，这山就叫不周了。\n\n## 名称由来\n\n不周山因何命名，是否与“周山”对立存在，不得而知。但是不周山象征着不完整、灾难。或者说，它本身就是不完整、灾难的集合体。\n这个神秘的不周山在什么地方，今天的人不知道。因此，所有的山都成了不周山，人对土地产生了泛敬畏。\n\n## 相关传说\n\n### 共工怒触\n\n共工怒触不周山，据传说，颛顼是黄帝的孙子，号高阳氏，居于帝丘（今河南濮阳附近）。他聪明敏慧，有智谋，在民众中有很高的威信。他统治的地盘也大了很多，北到现在的河北一带，南到南岭以南，西到现在的甘肃一带，东到东海中的一些岛屿，都是他统治的地城。古代历史书上描写说，颛顼视察所到之处，都受到部落民众的热情接待。\n与颛顼同时，有个部落领袖，叫做共工氏。传说他是人首蛇身，长着满头的赤发，他的坐骑是两条龙。\n据说共工氏姓姜，是炎帝的后代。他的部落在现在今天的河南北部。他对农耕很重视，尤其对水利工作更是抓紧，发明了筑堤蓄水的办法。那个时候，人类主要从事农业生产，水的利用是至关重要的。共工氏是神农氏以后，又一个为发展农业生产做出过贡献的人。\n共工有个子女叫后土，对农业也很精通\n。他们为了发展农业生产，把水利的事办好，就一起考察了部落的土地情况，发现有的地方地势太高，田地浇水很费力；有的地方地势太低，容易被淹。由于这些原因，非常不利于农业生产。因此共工氏制订了一个计划，把土地的高处的土运去垫高低地，认为把下洼地垫高可以扩大耕种面积，高地去平，利于水利灌溉，对发展农业生产大有好处。\n颛顼部不赞成共工氏的做法。颛顼认为，在部族中至高无上的权威是自己，整个部族应当只听从他一个人的号令，共工氏是不能自作主张的。他以这样做会让上天发怒为理由，反对共工氏实行他的计划。于是，颛顼与共工氏之间发生了一场十分激烈的斗争，表面上是对治土、治水的争论，实际上是对部族领导权的争夺。\n要说这两个人比起来，力气上，共工氏要强；论机智，他却不如颛顼。颛顼利用鬼神的说法，煽动部落民众，叫他们不要相信共工氏。当时的人对自然知识缺少了解，对鬼神之事都极为相信，不少人上了颛顼的当，认为共工氏一平整土地，真的会触怒鬼神，引来灾难，因此颛顼得到了多数民众的支持。\n共工氏不能得到民众的理解和支持，但他坚信自己的计划是正确的，坚决不肯妥协。为了天下人民的利益，他决心不惜牺牲自己，用生命去殉自己的事业。他来到不周山（今昆仑山），想把不周山的峰顶撞下来，来表示自己的坚强决心。\n共工氏驾起飞龙，来到半空，猛地一下撞向不周山。霎时间，一声震天巨响，只见不周山被共工氏猛然一撞，立即拦腰折断，整个山体轰隆隆地崩塌下来。天地之间发生巨变，天空中，日月星辰都变了位置；大地上，山川移动，河川变流。原来这不周山是天地之间的支柱，天柱折断了，使得系着大地的绳子也崩断了，只见大地向东南方向塌陷。天空向西北方向倾倒。因为天空向西北方向倾倒，日月星辰就每天都从东边升起，向西边降落；因为大地向东南塌陷，大江大河的水就都奔腾向东，流入东边的大海里去了。\n共工氏英勇的行为得到了人们的尊敬。在他死后，人们奉他为水师 （司水利之神），他的子女后土也被人们奉为社神（即土地神），后来人们发誓时说\"苍天后土在上\"，就谈的是他，由此可见人们对他们的敬重。\n\n### 不周山\n\n关于共工氏和颛顼争夺帝位，怒撞不周山的传说，已经流传了两千多年。前边讲的几个神话，说明在那时我们的祖先尚不知如何解释各种各样的自然现象，不了解和掌握自然规律，因此在自然面前是那样的无力，因此把各种疑惑归之于神的存在，自然之力被形象化，人格化。所以创造了神话传说，歌颂心目中的英雄，也就塑造出了神话中盘古、女娲、黄帝等等传奇人物来。\n至于传说中的共工氏，当然并不一定实有其事，然而他那种勇敢、坚强，愿意牺牲自己来改造山河的大无畏精神，是值得我们钦佩的。尽管前边所讲的神话和传说是后人的臆想和艺术加工，但是原始社会部落首领的神化，反映了原来服务于部落的首领转化成了高踞于社会之上的权力。原始社会也就开始有了阶级的分化。\n注：“五帝”指的是黄帝和他以后的颛顼、帝喾、尧、舜这五个部落联盟领袖，他们被古代的历史学家尊称为 “五帝”。\n共工 炎帝裔。据《山海经·海内经》：“炎帝之妻，赤水之子听袄生炎居，炎居生节并，节并生戏器，戏器生祝融，祝融降处于江水，生共工。”宋罗泌《路史·后纪二》注引《归藏·启筮》：“共工人面蛇身朱发。”相传共工为水神。《左传·昭公十七年》：“共工氏以水纪，故为水师而水名。《管子·揆度》：“共工之王，水处什之七，陆处什之三，乘天势以隘制夫下。”《淮南子·本经训》：“舜之时，共工振滔洪水，以薄空桑。”共工神话最著者，为共工与颛顼之战。《淮南子·天文训》：“昔者共工与颛顼争为帝，怒而触不周之山，天柱折、地维绝，天倾西北，故日月星辰移焉；地不满东南，故水潦尘埃归焉。”颛顼，黄帝之裔（《山海经·海内经》）。故此战实为黄炎战争之继续。此战又或传为共工与高辛（《淮南子·原道》）；与神农（《雕玉集·壮力》）；与祝融（《史记·补三皇本纪》）；与女娲（《路史·太吴纪》）之争。其他如禹逐共工，禹杀共工之臣相柳等传说，由禹为黄帝系统人物，当亦系黄炎战争之余绪。今河南杞县流传的“女娲补天”则谓：共工、祝融，女娲、棺人为兄妹。共工与祝融因吃天鹅蛋之争，共工撞不周山，天塌洪水泛滥，女娲乃有补天之举，似更原始。参见百科词条“共工”、“杞人忧天”。\n共工怒触不周山，天柱折，地维绝，女娲于是炼五色石补天----《李凭箜篌引》（此为唐代作品）。\n\n### 盘古\n\n不周山与盘古的关系“ 首生盘古，垂死化身。……四肢五体为四极五岳。……肌肉为田土。”看来不周山也是盘古的一个部分，不知道是哪个部分，可以称之为天柱，虽极其重要，但却“不周”。这个重要的东西虽然不周，但还有大用处：顶着老天爷。一旦撞翻，问题就大了。\n《淮南子· 天文训》：“昔者共工与颛顼争为帝，怒而触不周之山。天柱折，地维绝。天倾西北，故日月星辰移焉，地不满东南，故水潦尘埃归 焉。”这句话的意思有两种可能，一是不周山就是天柱，二是不周山包含天柱。无论如何，这个天柱本身就有缺陷。翻译出来的大体意思是：过去，有个名共工的与另一个名颛顼的争夺帝位。共工因不能获胜而发怒，用头撞不周山，致使折断西北角的一条撑天柱子，和东南角的一条系地大绳。所以，天向西北倾斜，日月星辰都向西北方移动；而地面向东南方低洼，水和泥沙都流向东南。\n\n## 相关记载\n\n### 古书记载\n\n《山海经· 西山经》：“又西北三百七十里曰不周之山。”郭注：“此山形有缺，不周帀处，因名云。”\n《大荒西经》：又云“西北海外，大荒之隅，有山而不合，名曰不周。”看来，此山名并非共工氏触之后才得名的，而是它本身就有些问题。\n《淮南子· 天文训》：“昔者共工与颛顼争为帝，怒而触不周之山。天柱折，地维绝。天倾西北，故日月星辰移焉，地不满东南，故水潦尘埃归焉。”\n“路不周以左转兮”。王逸注：“不周，山名，在昆仑西北。”《山海经·大荒西经》云：“西北海之外，大荒之隅，有山而不合，名曰不周（原“不周”下有“负子”二字，系衍文从郝懿行校删）。”郭璞注：“《淮南子》曰：‘昔者共工与颛顼争帝，怒而触周之山，天维绝，地柱折（今本《淮南子·天文篇》作“天柱折、地维绝”）。’故今此山缺坏不周币也。”此山原为天柱，经共工触坏，始有“不周”之名。又《吕氏春秋·本味》云：“饭之美者，玄山之禾，不周之粟。”《山海经·西次三经》云：“不周之山……，爰有嘉果，其实如桃，其叶如枣，黄华而赤柎，食之不劳。”则此山以产美味见称。参见“天柱”、“共工”。\n据《山海经·海内经》：“炎帝之妻，赤水之子听袄生炎居，炎居生节并，节并生戏器，戏器生祝融，祝融降处于江水，生共工。”宋罗泌《路史·后纪二》注引《归藏·启筮》：“共工人面蛇身朱发。”相传共工为水神。《左传·昭公十七年》：“共工氏以水纪，故为水师而水名。《管子·揆度》：“共工之王，水处什之七，陆处什之三，乘天势以隘制夫下。”《淮南子·本经训》：“舜之时，共工振滔洪水，以薄空桑。”共工神话最著者，为共工与颛顼之战。《淮南子·天文训》：“昔者共工与颛顼争为帝，怒而触不周之山，天柱折、地维绝，天倾西北，故日月星辰移焉；地不满东南，故水潦尘埃归焉。”颛顼，黄帝之裔（《山海经·海内经》）。故此战实为黄炎战争之继续。此战又或传为共工与高辛（《淮南子·原道》）；与神农（《雕玉集·壮力》）；与祝融（《史记·补三皇本纪》）；与女娲（《路史·太吴纪》）之争。其他如禹逐共工，禹杀共工之臣相柳等传说，由禹为黄帝系统人物，当亦系黄炎战争之余绪。今河南杞县流传的“女娲补天”则谓：共工、祝融，女娲、棺人为兄妹。共工与祝融因吃天鹅蛋之争，共工撞不周山，天塌洪水泛滥，女娲乃有补天之举，似更原始。参见“杞人忧天”。\n\n### 天界路径\n\n相传不周山是人界唯一能够到达天界的路径，只可惜不周山终年寒冷，长年飘雪，非凡夫俗子所能徒步到达。传言曾有凡人为见神仙一面而只身上山，但却未曾见其返乡。自此之后，人人皆炼其身，锻其骨，以使得自己有足够的实力攀登不周山，后由于天条的放宽，无数凡人开始修行，为使自己能早日功德圆满，不少人开始竞相挑战不周山。\n\n### 寻不周山\n\n诗人毛泽东写道：“唤起工农千百万，同心干，不周山下红旗乱。”\n在这里，毛泽东是很欣赏共工的。他引用了《淮南子·天文训》一说，共工“怒而触不周之山，天柱折，地维绝，天倾西北，故日月星辰移焉，地不满东南，故水潦尘埃归焉。”诗人写道：“他死了没有呢？”\n\n## 位置考证\n\n### 帕米尔\n\n不周山为古代传说中的山名，最早见于《山海经·大荒西经》：“西北海之外，大荒之隅，有山而不合，名曰不周负子。”春秋战国时期的楚国大诗人屈原在他的不朽著作《离骚》中就有“路不周以左转兮，指西海以为期。”同期成书的《淮南子·天文训》则对不周山之“不周”，作了更为神奇的描述：“昔共工与颛琐争为帝，怒而触不周之山，天柱折，地维绝。天倾西北，故日月星辰移焉；地不满东南，故水潦尘埃归焉。”据王逸注《离骚》，高周注《淮南子·道原训》均考不周山在昆仑山西北。这个不周山即今日昆仑山西北部的帕米尔。\n\n### 祁连山尾\n\n公元前7719年，不周山忽遭大风雨，观天的大风雨表被毁，倾向东南。面对这场天灾，骊连氏（时任祁连山西表总管），认为是共工氏的责任，不应再任上相。女娲听信骊连氏所言，决定由骊连氏任上相。共工不服，不交出祭天权，聚族众守山，坚守表木天柱。骊连氏也率众攻山，两族在不周山争战，决战中撞毁了天柱，女娲怒，逐共工康回（虺）于祁连，共工含愤而去，族众不离，骊连也难以进驻，骊连建议迁榜罗，伏羲同意迁榜罗，重立天表。共工于公元前7687年或7690年卒于祁连山，于是遂有共工怒触不周山之传说。不周山位于祁连山尾（六盘山西侧），三面环山，东面有一谷口，故名不周山。\n\n### 贺兰山脉\n\n宁夏回族自治区贺兰山东北部分，贺兰山脉位于宁夏回族自治区与内蒙古自治区交界处。北起内蒙古巴彦敖包，跨石嘴山市，银川市，东南端至青铜峡，山体在蓝天和黄河映衬下格外壮丽。贺兰山东北部分在石嘴山市石炭井区境内有穿山而过的大武口沟，古称“打硙口”是中原汉族与北方少数民族的兵家必争之地。因为有可以连接荒凉漠北和富庶内地的险要山峡，此正所谓《山海经》中“有山而不合，名曰不周”所相印证。相传大禹治水时，劈开贺兰山，引黄河水北流。贺兰山地处温带荒漠与温带荒漠草原的分界线，又是西北内流区与外流区的分水岭。山谷内多岩画，年代无法考证，构图奇特，形象怪诞：既有个体图像，也有组合画面；既有人物像、人面像，又有动物、天体、植物符号和不明含义的符号，诸多岩画图案与《山海经》中所描述出产的珍禽异兽相吻合。故，《山海经》中不周山描述应是此地。\n\n### 诸毗之山\n\n内蒙古土默川平原以西，参见《经典图读山海经》\n根据《帝禹山河图》，不周山位于钟山的东面、昆仑丘的东北方，其地理方位“北望诸毗之山，临彼岳崇之山，东望黝泽，河水所潜也，其原浑浑泡泡。爰有嘉果，其实如桃，其叶如枣，黄华而赤拊，食之不劳。”所谓诸毗之山，当指阴山山脉；所谓岳崇之山，可能指昆仑丘，也可能指今日山西省北部的吕梁山、五台山、恒山。据此，不周山位于黝泽的西面，那里是黄河的源头，笔者进一步指出，黝泽位于今日的黄河前套地区，亦即内蒙古的土墨特右旗至托克托县一带；所以，不周山位于黄河前套地区以西，阴山之南。\n\n### 赫尔蒙山\n\n《山海经》说“西北海之外，大荒之隅，有山而不合，名曰不周，有水曰寒暑之水。水西有湿山，水东有幕山。有禹攻共工国山。”\n“西北海之外”，这就是不周山的地理坐标。哪里是西北海？往西北方向找，苏武牧羊的贝加尔湖古时称“北海”，不像。青海湖的地理环境又和下面的地理描述不一致，也不像。西北好像没有这样的大海了。其实古人未必把自己局限在中国版图之内。在史前时代，印度洋就已经有了远洋航行的记录。更多的考古发现进一步证实了人类早在史前时代就利用“海洋季风”航行在印度洋上。因此，古人把印度洋称之西海、西北海完全是可能的。\n“有山而不合，名曰不周。”这是不周山的地理形状。在“西北海（即印度洋）之外”的东非有合不起来的山，这就是东非大裂谷。它从赞比亚河口北延至红海南端，大致南北走向，绵延4500公里以上。它在东非高原上切出深逾千米的狭长谷地。“不合”的东非裂谷群山绵延，大裂谷的北端是约旦河谷，大裂谷北端的赫尔蒙山是叙利亚境内的最高山脉，它也有一条近68公里的裂谷。\n在公元前16世纪至8世纪，统治赫尔蒙山所在地的是赫梯人，这是一个最早使用铁器的民族。他们和埃及反复争夺叙利亚的统治权，因而赫尔蒙山的地理环境地理形状等知识的传播就是十分正常的事情。更何况，赫尔蒙山脚下的约旦河，就是一条“寒暑之水”。它的水量随着季节的不同而有极大的变化，低的时候水量只有每秒60立方米，高的时候要达每秒1760立方米，两者相差近30倍。把水量的变化称之为“寒暑”，可见古人的智慧。\n“水西有湿山，水东有幕山”，约旦河西岸是典型的地中海气候，年降雨量为760－1270毫米，气候温润潮湿，堪称“湿山”。而约旦河东面是典型的沙漠气候，年降雨量不到130毫米，干旱少雨的气候使居住在那里的民族经常发生用水的纠纷，所以我们的祖先把它称之为“幕（漠）山”。\n由此可见，赫尔蒙山的地理坐标、地理形状和地理环境与不周山完全一致。诗人毛泽东不会想到，失败了的英雄共工，居然会到4万里外的不周山去撞得“天柱折，地维绝”。\n\n### 其他山脉\n\n山西省长子县的西山相传就是不周山，而精卫填海的故事也发生在这里。\n传说宁夏和甘肃境内的六盘山为不周之山的残骸。"], "selected_questions": ["不周山在《山海经·大荒西经》中被怎样描述？", "在传说中，共工为什么会触怒不周山？这个事件带来了什么后果？", "不周山的名称由来如何？它与灾难、不完整有何关联？"], "GPT3.5_answers_D":

{"name": "梅毒", "documents": ["梅毒是由苍白（梅毒）螺旋体引起的慢性、系统性性传播疾病。主要通过性途径传播，临床上可表现为一期梅毒、二期梅毒、三期梅毒、潜伏梅毒和先天梅毒（胎传梅毒）等。是《中华人民共和国传染病防治法》中，列为乙类防治管理的病种。\n\n## 流行病学\n\n梅毒在全世界流行，据WHO估计，全球每年约有1200万新发病例，主要集中在南亚、东南亚和次撒哈拉非洲。近年来梅毒在我国增长迅速，已成为报告病例数最多的性病。所报告的梅毒中，潜伏梅毒占多数，一、二期梅毒也较为常见，先天梅毒报告病例数也在增加。\n梅毒患者的皮肤、黏膜中含梅毒螺旋体，未患病者在与梅毒患者的性接触中，皮肤或黏膜若有细微破损则可得病。极少数可通过输血或途径传染。获得性梅毒（后天）早期梅毒病人是传染源，95%以上是通过危险的或无保护的性行为传染，少数通过接亲吻、输血、污染的衣物等传染。胎传梅毒由患梅毒的孕妇传染，如果一、二期和早期潜伏梅毒的孕妇，传染给胎儿的几率相当高。\n1.传染源\n梅毒是人类独有的疾病，显性和隐性梅毒患者是传染源，感染梅毒的人的皮损及其分泌物、血液中含有梅毒螺旋体。感染后的头2年最具传染性，而在4年后性传播的传染性大为下降。梅毒螺旋体可通过胎盘传给胎儿，早期梅毒的孕妇传染给胎儿的危险性很大。\n2.传播途径\n性接触是梅毒的主要传播途径，占95%以上。感染梅毒的早期传染性最强。随着病期的延长传染性越来越小，一般认为感染后4年以上性接触的传染性十分微弱。\n患有梅毒的孕妇可通过胎盘传染给胎儿，引起胎儿宫内感染，可导致流产、早产、死胎或分娩胎传梅毒儿。一般认为孕妇梅毒病期越早，对胎儿感染的机会越大。孕妇即使患有无症状的隐性梅毒还具有传染性。\n\n## 临床表现\n\n1.获得性显性梅毒\n（1）一期梅毒 标志性临床特征是硬下疳。好发部位为阴茎、龟头、冠状沟、包皮、尿道口；大小阴唇、阴蒂、宫颈；肛门、肛管等。也可见于唇、舌、乳房等处。①硬下疳特点为 感染TP后7～60天出现，大多数病人硬下疳为单发、无痛无痒、圆形或椭圆形、边界清晰的溃疡，高出皮面，疮面较清洁，有继发感染者分泌物多。触之有软骨样硬度。持续时间为4～6周，可自愈。硬下疳可以和二期梅毒并存，须与软下疳、生殖器疱疹、固定性药疹等的生殖器溃疡性疾病相鉴别。②近卫淋巴结肿大 出现硬下疳后1～2周，部分病人出现腹股沟或近卫淋巴结肿大，可单个也可多个，肿大的淋巴结大小不等、质硬、不粘连、不破溃、无痛。\n（2）二期梅毒 以二期梅毒疹为特征，有全身症状，一般在硬下疳消退后相隔一段无症状期再发生。TP随血液循环播散，引发多部位损害和多样病灶。侵犯皮肤、黏膜、骨骼、内脏、心血管、神经系统。梅毒进入二期时，梅毒血清学试验几乎100%阳性。全身症状发生在皮疹出现前，发热、头痛、骨关节酸痛、肝脾肿大、淋巴结肿大。男性发生率约25%；女性约50%。3～5日好转。接着出现梅毒疹，并有反复发生的特点。①皮肤梅毒疹 80%～95%的病人发生。特点为疹型多样和反复发生、广泛而对称、不痛不痒、愈后多不留瘢痕、驱梅治疗迅速消退。主要疹型有斑疹样、丘疹样、脓疱性梅毒疹及扁平湿疣、掌跖梅毒疹等。②复发性梅毒疹 初期的梅毒疹自行消退后，约20%的二期梅毒病人于一年内复发,以环状丘疹最为多见。③黏膜损害 约50%的病人出现黏膜损害。发生在唇、口腔、扁桃体及咽喉，为黏膜斑或黏膜炎，有渗出物，或发生灰白膜，黏膜红肿。④梅毒性脱发 约占病人的10%。多为稀疏性，边界不清，如虫蚀样；少数为弥漫样。⑤骨关节损害 骨膜炎、骨炎、骨髓炎及关节炎。伴疼痛。⑥二期眼梅毒 梅毒性虹膜炎、虹膜睫状体炎、脉络膜炎、视网膜炎等。常为双侧。⑦二期神经梅毒 多无明显症状，脑脊液异常，脑脊液RPR阳性。可有脑膜炎或脑膜血管症状。⑧全身浅表淋巴结肿大\n（3）三期梅毒 1/3的未经治疗的显性TP感染发生三期梅毒。其中，15%为良性晚期梅毒,15%～20%为严重的晚期梅毒。①皮肤黏膜损害 结节性梅毒疹好发于头皮、肩胛、背部及四肢的伸侧。树胶样肿常发生在小腿部，为深溃疡形成，萎缩样瘢痕；发生在上额部时，组织坏死，穿孔；发生于鼻中膈者则骨质破坏，形成马鞍鼻；舌部者为穿凿性溃疡；阴道损害为出现溃疡，可形成膀胱阴道漏或直肠阴道漏等。②近关节结节 是梅毒性纤维瘤缓慢生长的皮下纤维结节，对称性、大小不等、质硬、不活动、不破溃、表皮正常、无炎症、无痛、可自消。③心血管梅毒 主要侵犯主动脉弓部位，可发生主动脉瓣闭锁不全,引起梅毒性心脏病。④神经梅毒 发生率约10%,可在感染早期或数年、数十年后发生。可无症状，也可发生梅毒性脑膜炎、脑血管梅毒、脑膜树胶样肿、麻痹性痴呆。脑膜树胶样肿为累及一侧大脑半球皮质下的病变，发生颅内压增高、头痛及脑局部压迫症状。实质性神经梅毒系脑或脊髓的实质性病损，前者形成麻痹性痴呆，后者表现为脊髓后根及后索的退行性变，有感觉异常、共济失调等多种病征，即脊髓痨。\n2.获得性隐性梅毒\n后天感染TP后未形成显性梅毒而呈无症状表现，或显性梅毒经一定的活动期后症状暂时消退，梅毒血清试验阳性、脑脊液检查正常，称为隐性（潜伏）梅毒。感染后2年内的称为早期潜伏梅毒；感染后2年以上的称为晚期潜伏梅毒。\n3.妊娠梅毒\n妊娠梅毒是孕期发生的显性或隐性梅毒。妊娠梅毒时，TP可通过胎盘或脐静脉传给胎儿，形成以后所生婴儿的先天梅毒。孕妇因发生小动脉炎导致胎盘组织坏死，造成流产、早产、死胎，只有少数孕妇可生健康儿。\n4.先天性显性梅毒\n（1）早期先天梅毒 患儿出生时即瘦小，出生后3周出现症状,全身淋巴结肿大，无粘连、无痛、质硬。多有梅毒性鼻炎。出生后约6周出现皮肤损害，呈水疱-大疱型皮损（梅毒性天疱疮）或斑丘疹、丘疹鳞屑性损害。可发生骨软骨炎、骨膜炎。多有肝、脾肿大。血小板减少和贫血。可发生神经梅毒。不发生硬下疳。\n（2）晚期先天梅毒 发生在2岁以后。一类是早期病变所致的骨、齿、眼、神经及皮肤的永久性损害，如马鞍鼻、郝秦森齿等，无活动性。另一类是仍具活动性损害所致的临床表现，如角膜炎、神经性耳聋、神经系统表现异常、脑脊液变化、肝脾肿大、鼻或颚树胶肿、关节积水、骨膜炎、指炎及皮肤黏膜损害等。\n5.先天潜伏梅毒\n生于患梅毒的母亲，未经治疗，无临床表现，但梅毒血清反应阳性，年龄小于2岁者为早期先天潜伏梅毒，大于2岁者为晚期先天潜伏梅毒。\n\n## 诊断\n\n1.流行病学病史\n有不安全的性接触史；孕产妇梅毒感染史；输注血液史。\n2.临床表现\n有各期梅毒相应的临床表现。如为潜伏梅毒则无明显临床表现。\n3.实验室检查\n（1）暗视野显微镜检查 取患者的可疑皮损（如硬下疳、扁平湿疣、湿丘疹等），在暗视野显微镜下检查，见到可运动的梅毒螺旋体，可作为梅毒的确诊依据。\n（2）梅毒血清学试验 梅毒血清学试验方法很多，所用抗原有非螺旋体抗原（心磷脂抗原）和梅毒螺旋体特异性抗原两类。前者有快速血浆反应素环状卡片试验（RPR）、甲苯胺红不加热血清学试验（TRUST）等，可做定量试验，用于判断疗效、判断病情活动程度。后者有梅毒螺旋体颗粒凝集试验（TPPA）、梅毒螺旋体酶联免疫吸附试验（TP-ELISA）等，特异性强，用于TP感染的确证。\n梅毒螺旋体IgM抗体检测：感染梅毒后，首先出现IgM抗体，随着疾病发展，IgG抗体随后才出现并慢慢上升。经有效治疗后IgM抗体消失，IgG抗体则持续存在。TP-IgM抗体不能通过胎盘，如果婴儿TP-IgM阳性则表示婴儿已被感染，因此，TP-IgM抗体检测对诊断婴儿的胎传梅毒意义很大。\n（3）脑脊液检查 梅毒患者出现神经症状者，或者经过驱梅治疗无效者，应作脑脊液检查。这一检查对神经梅毒的诊断、治疗及预后的判断均有帮助。检查项目应包括：细胞计数、总蛋白测定、RPR及TPPA试验等。\n\n## 鉴别诊断\n\n1.一期梅毒硬下疳应与软下疳、固定性药疹、生殖器疱疹等鉴别。\n2.一期梅毒近卫淋巴结肿大应与软下疳、性病性淋巴肉芽肿引起的淋巴结肿大相鉴别。\n3.二期梅毒的皮疹应与玫瑰糠疹、多形红斑、花斑癣、银屑病、体癣等鉴别。扁平湿疣应与尖锐湿疣相鉴别。\n\n## 并发症\n\n1.梅毒孕妇可传染胎儿，引起死产、流产、早产，导致婴儿的先天梅毒等，严重危害妇女儿童的健康。\n2.梅毒螺旋体侵犯中枢神经系统，可引发脑膜血管病变、脊髓痨、麻痹性痴呆。侵犯心血管系统，可导致主动脉炎、主动脉瓣闭锁不全、主动脉瘤等。严重者可致死。\n3.梅毒螺旋体损害骨骼、眼、呼吸道、消化道等系统，引起组织和器官破坏，功能丧失，严重者导致残疾或其他不良后果。梅毒的流行严重影响社会风气。因患病导致劳动力丧失，社会负担加重。梅毒还可影响家庭的稳定。\n\n## 治疗\n\n1.治疗原则\n强调早诊断，早治疗，疗程规则，剂量足够。疗后定期进行临床和实验室随访。性伙伴要同查同治。早期梅毒经彻底治疗可临床痊愈，消除传染性。晚期梅毒治疗可消除组织内炎症，但已破坏的组织难以修复。\n青霉素，如水剂青霉素、普鲁卡因青霉素、苄星青霉素等为不同分期梅毒的首选药物。对青霉素过敏者可选四环素、红霉素等。部分病人青霉素治疗之初可能发生吉海反应,可由小剂量开始或使用其他药物加以防止。梅毒治疗后第一年内应每3月复查血清一次，以后每6个月一次，共3年。神经梅毒和心血管梅毒应随访终身。\n2.早期梅毒（包括一期、二期梅毒及早期潜伏梅毒）\n（1）青霉素疗法 苄星青霉素G（长效西林），分两侧臀部肌注，每周1次，共2-3次。普鲁卡因青霉素G，肌注，连续10～15天，总量800万u～1200万u。\n（2）对青霉素过敏者 盐酸四环素，口服，连服15天。强力霉素，连服15天。\n3.晚期梅毒（包括三期皮肤、黏膜、骨骼梅毒、晚期潜伏梅毒）及二期复发梅毒\n（1）青霉素 苄星青霉素G，1次/周，肌注，共3次。普鲁卡因青霉素G，肌注，连续20天。可间隔2周后重复治疗1次。\n（2）对青霉素过敏者 盐酸四环素，口服，连服30天。强力霉素，连服30天。\n4.神经梅毒\n应住院治疗，为避免治疗中产生吉海氏反应，在注射青霉素前一天口服强的松，1次/日，连续3天。\n（1）水剂青霉素G 静脉点滴，连续14天。\n（2）普鲁卡因青霉素G 肌肉注射，同时口服丙磺舒，共10～14天。\n上述治疗后，再接用苄星青霉素G，1次/周，肌注，连续3周。\n5.妊娠期梅毒\n按相应病期的梅毒治疗方案给予治疗，在妊娠最初3个月内，应用一疗程；妊娠末3个月应用一疗程。对青霉素过敏者，用红霉素治疗，早期梅毒连服15天，二期复发及晚期梅毒连服30天。其所生婴儿应用青霉素补治。\n6.胎传梅毒（先天梅毒）\n早期先天梅毒（2岁以内）脑脊液异常者：水剂青霉素G或普鲁卡因青霉素G治疗，具体剂量遵医嘱。脑脊液正常者：苄星青霉素G，一次注射（分两侧臀肌）。如无条件检查脑脊液者，可按脑脊液异常者治疗。\n7.孕妇的梅毒治疗\n（1）有梅毒病史的已婚妇女在孕前一定进行全面梅毒检查。有过不洁性生活或者曾感染过梅毒的女性在打算怀孕前，最好去正规医院做全面梅毒检测。对于那些梅毒治疗完成、梅毒症状不明显的已婚女性也要在确定梅毒治愈后，才能怀孕。\n（2）妊娠期的梅毒检查和治疗：在妊娠初3个月及末均应作梅毒血清学检查。如发现感染梅毒应正规治疗，以减少发生胎传梅毒的机会。\n8.梅毒治疗中的吉海反应\n毒治疗首次用药后数小时内，可能出现发热、头痛、关节痛、恶心、呕吐、梅毒疹加剧等情况，属吉海反应，症状多会在24小时内缓解。为了预防发生吉海反应，青霉素可由小剂量开始逐渐增加到正常量，对神经梅毒及心血管梅毒可以在治疗前给予一个短疗程泼尼松，分次给药，抗梅治疗后2～4天逐渐停用。皮质类固醇可减轻吉海反应的发热，但对局部炎症反应的作用则不确定。\n9.饮食注意事项\n患梅毒后的饮食调养与其他感染性疾病一样，均要吃新鲜富含维生素的蔬菜、水果，少吃油腻的饮食，忌食辛辣刺激食物，戒烟、酒，适当多饮水，有利于体内毒素的排除。\n\n## 预后\n\n梅毒经过治疗后，如何判断是否痊愈，通常是用梅毒血清学的检测来加以判断，各大医院比较常用的是RPR（快速血浆反应素环状卡片试验）和TPPA（梅毒螺旋体颗粒凝集试验）。RPR是非特异性梅毒血清学试验，常用于疗效的判断。TPPA检测血清中特异性梅毒螺旋体抗体，有较高的敏感性和特异性。本法检测一旦阳性，无论治疗与否或疾病是否活动，通常终身保持阳性不变，其滴度变化与梅毒是否活动无关，故不能作为评价疗效或判定复发与再感染的指标，只能够作为梅毒的确认试验。\n凡确诊为梅毒者，治疗前最好做RPR定量试验。两次定量试验滴度变化相差2个稀释度以上时，才可判定滴度下降。梅毒患者在经过正规治疗以后，每三个月复查一次RPR，半年后每半年复查一次RPR，随访2～3年，观察比较当前与前几次的RPR滴度变化的情况。在治疗后3～6个月，滴度有4倍以上的下降，说明治疗有效。滴度可持续下降乃至转为阴性。如果连续三次到四次检测的结果都是阴性，则可以认为该患者的梅毒已临床治愈。\n梅毒患者在抗梅治疗后，其血清反应一般有3种变化的可能：\n1.血清阴转。\n2.血清滴度降低不阴转，或血清抵抗。\n3.转阴后又变为阳性，或持续下降过程中又有上升，表明有复发或再感染。\n各期梅毒接受不同药物的治疗，血清反应阴转率可有差别。一、二期梅毒接受任何抗梅药物治疗，血清阴转率皆高，通常在1～2年内可达70%～95%不等。当一期梅毒正规抗梅治疗后12个月，二期梅毒24个月后，血清反应仍然维持阳性，在临床上称之为血清抵抗或血清固定，发生原因可能与体内仍有潜在的活动性病变、患者免疫力下降、抗梅治疗剂量不足或有耐药等因素有关，也有查不到原因。对这类患者，应该做包括脑脊液检查、艾滋病检查在内的全面体检，以发现可能存在的原因并给予相应的处理。如果没有特殊异常发现，可以定期随访观察，不要盲目给予抗生素过度治疗。\n\n## 预防\n\n首先应加强健康教育和宣传，避免不安全的性行为，其次应采取以下预防措施和注意事项。\n1.追踪病人的性伴，查找病人所有性接触者，进行预防检查，追踪观察并进行必要的治疗，未治愈前禁止性行为。\n2.对可疑病人均应进行预防检查，做梅毒血清试验，以便早期发现病人并及时治疗。\n3.对患梅毒的孕妇，应及时给予有效治疗，以防止将梅毒感染给胎儿。未婚的感染梅毒者，最好治愈后再结婚。\n4.如需献血，要去正规采血点，在献血前需做全面的血液检查，预防感染。如需输血，需要输血单位出示所输血液的检查证明，防止不必要的麻烦发生。\n5.梅毒患者应注意劳逸结合，进行必要的功能锻炼，保持良好的心态，以利康复。\n6.注意生活细节，防止传染他人：早期梅毒患者有较强的传染性，晚期梅毒虽然传染性逐渐减小，但也要小心进行防护。自己的内裤、毛巾及时单独清洗，煮沸消毒，不与他人同盆而浴。发生硬下疳或外阴、肛周扁平湿疣时，可以使用清热解毒、除湿杀虫的中草药煎水熏洗坐浴。\n7.梅毒患者在未治愈前应禁止性行为，如有发生则必须使用安全套。", "## 梅毒\n梅毒（Syphilis）是一种细菌型的性传染病，病原体是螺旋菌菌种梅毒螺旋体的一种亚种（Treponema pallidum pallidum）。其病原体最早由德国的Erich Hoffmann和Fritz Schaudinn在1905年发现。梅毒的病征和症状相当多样，随著感染期（初期、第二期、潜伏期，和第三期）的不同会有不同的症状。初期典型呈现单一chancre（坚硬、无痛、无搔痒的皮肤溃疡），但会有多处酸痛；在第二期中会出现经常遍布到手掌与脚掌的广泛红疹。在口腔与阴道处会有溃疡。潜伏期的患者症状通常不明显，可能维持数年。在第三期会有gummas（柔软、非癌症式生长）、神经性与心脏疾病。梅毒因其症状表现类似许多其他疾病，而以「伟大的模仿者」为人熟知。\n梅毒主要透过人类性行为传播。该疾病也可由母亲在怀孕或分娩时传染给胎儿，导致Congenital syphilis。其他由相关「梅毒螺旋体」造成的人类疾病包括雅司病（pertenue亚种）、Pinta (disease)（carateum亚种）及Nonvenereal endemic syphilis（endemicum亚种）。通常梅毒可以透过血液检查诊断出来，不过其实梅毒螺旋体能使用暗视野显微镜检测。美国疾病预防中心会建议所有孕妇都进行相关检验。\n防治梅毒的方法包含使用乳胶保险套，与减少性伴侣等方式。梅毒可以利用抗生素有效治疗。许多病例中偏好的抗生素为Benzathine benzylpenicillin肌肉内注射。对于有严重青霉素过敏的患者，可以使用去氧羟四环素或四环霉素。对于有神经性梅毒患者，建议使用青霉素G钾或头孢曲松。至于对青霉素严重过敏的病患则可以透过口服多西环素或阿奇霉素来进行治疗。治疗过程中，患者可能会产生发烧、头痛，与肌肉痛的雅-赫氏反应。\n在2015年，感染梅毒的人数约4,540万，新个案则有600万宗。而在2015年期间，梅毒造成10.7万人死亡，相对于1990年的20.2万人已降低许多。1940年代，由于抗药性的关系，青霉素的效用大幅降低。于是，感染率自世纪之交后便在许多国家上升，通常合并人类免疫不全病毒（HIV）。据信部分导因于劈腿族与性交易的增加，保险套使用的降低及各种不安全性行为。2015年，古巴成为世界第一个根除母子垂直感染梅毒的国家。\n##病征及症状\n梅毒的病程共有四期：第一期、第二期、潜伏期，和第三期，另外也有先天性梅毒。由于梅毒的症状多样，因此威廉·奥斯勒爵士以「厉害的模仿者」（the great imitator）一词来形容该疾病。\n###第一期梅毒\n初期梅毒通常因与另一已感染者直接性接触获得，暴露后约3至90天（平均21天）出现皮肤损伤，称原发性Chancre，会出现在接触的位置。典型下疳（机率40%）是单一、硬化、无痛、无皮肤瘙痒溃烂、清楚的边缘和平整的底部，大小约0.3到3.0公分。但是其后续病灶可能会以其他形式出现。典型的病灶会从斑疹、丘疹，最后到糜烂或溃疡，有时可能出现多发性病灶（〜40%），尤其是合并爱滋病感染时更为常见。病灶可能会很痛或触痛（30%），并且可能出现在不是生殖器的位置（2-7%）。在女性最常见的位置是子宫颈（44%），在男性阴茎（99%），在肛门和直肠比较常见于与男性性行为的男子（34%）。下疳形成后7至10天，感染区域周围的淋巴结常肿大（80%），若无治疗，损伤可能持续三至六周。\n###第二期梅毒\n梅毒将会在初期梅毒发生后大约四到十周左右转为二期梅毒。二期梅毒会以许多不同症状呈现，症状大多发生在皮肤、黏膜以及淋巴结。四肢与指间可能会有具对称性、介于红与粉红之间、不造成搔痒的红疹。红疹可能会转为Maculopapular rash或脓疡，红疹会渐渐转为型态扁平、颜色偏白、疣状的病灶，好发在黏膜，称为Condylomata lata。以上这些病灶都充满细菌且具传染性。其他的症状像是：发烧、喉咙痛、倦怠、体重减轻、掉发与头痛，较少见的表征像是肝炎、肾脏疾病、关节炎、骨膜炎、Optic neuritis、葡萄膜炎、Interstitial keratitis。急性症状往往会在三到六周之间缓解有将近四分之一的患者会重复出现二期梅毒的症状。许多表现二期梅毒症状的人（40%－80%的女性、20%－65%的男性），并没有经历过初期梅毒（硬下疳）的典型症状。\n###潜伏期\n梅毒潜伏期定义为：血清学上有感染证据，但却没有呈现症状的时期。潜伏期发生时机差异很大，在美国，以二期梅毒症状发生后一年为分界，分为早发潜伏期与晚发潜伏期，在英国，则以两年为分界进入早发潜伏期的梅毒容易复发而晚发潜伏期的梅毒往往Asymptomatic，也并不像是进入早发潜伏期的梅毒一样具有传染性。\n###第三期梅毒\n三期梅毒在初次感染梅毒后三到十五年后发生，而且分为三种不同的形态：橡胶样梅毒瘤（gummatous syphilis，15%）、晚期神经性梅毒（6.5%）以及梅毒性心血管疾病（10%）。未经治疗的梅毒，将有三分之一的患者进入三期梅毒，三期梅毒患者并未具有传染性。\n梅毒瘤或晚发良性梅毒，通常好发在初次感染梅毒后1到46年后，平均大约是十五年。这个阶段会形成慢性的Gumma (pathology)，往往是软质、持续发炎的肉瘤组织，大小则不断变动。一般来说会感染皮肤、骨头和肝脏，但可发生在全身各处。\n神经性梅毒指的是梅毒已经感染中枢神经。在感染初期可能就会发生，此时可能毫无症状或是以梅毒性脑炎的方式表现；或是晚期以颅内血管性梅毒、麻痹性痴呆、Tabes dorsalis表现，会造成下肢平衡性差，以及宛如被闪电击中的疼痛。晚期神经性梅毒一般发生在初次感染后的四到二十五年后颅内血管性梅毒的症状一般会以情绪淡漠、癫痫、轻瘫伴随失智与Tabes dorsalis。神经性梅毒也会表现Argyll Robertson pupil，指的是双侧瞳孔对焦近物时会缩小，对强光却没有反应的症状。\n梅毒性心血管疾病发生在初次感染后十到三十年间，最严重的并发症是Syphilitic_aortitis，可能会导致主动脉瘤的形成。\n###先天性\n指的是在怀孕期间或出生时被传染的梅毒。三分之二感染梅毒的婴儿，出生时并没有任何症状，两岁左右开始出现的常见症状有：Hepatosplenomegaly（七成）、红疹（七成）、发烧（四成）、神经性梅毒（两成）以及肺炎（两成）。如果没有接受治疗，可能有四成会转为晚期先天性梅毒，出现Saddle nose、Higouménakis' sign、Saber shin和Clutton's joints等症状。\n##病因\n###病原菌\n梅毒螺旋体亚种螺旋体是螺旋状、革兰氏阴性、高度移动的细菌，其他相关梅毒螺旋体引起的人类疾病包括雅司病（雅司亚种）、Pinta (disease)（斑点螺旋体亚种）和Nonvenereal endemic syphilis（流行性亚种），它们不会导致神经系统疾病。人类是梅毒螺旋体亚种唯一已知的自然宿主，其无法在宿主以外的环境存活数天。这是由于其基因组很小（1.14 MDa），所以未编码制造主要营养的代谢路径。梅毒螺旋体亚种的倍增时间大于30小时，是较缓慢的。\n###传播\n梅毒主要是透过性行为传染，或在怀孕时由母亲垂直传染给胎儿，螺旋体可穿过粘膜或有伤口的皮肤，因此若亲吻时有碰触到伤口也是有可能被感染，同样地，口交、性交以及肛交都是传染途径。大约30-60%曾接触第一期或第二期梅毒病灶的人会得到此病。若用实例来解说，57个接种个体中大约有50%的机率会被感染，如此可知梅毒的传染力。大多数（60%)发生在美国的新病例都是男男间性交导致。它同样也会借由血液制品传播，但因为现今有许多国家都开始进行血液检测，所以也降低了传染风险。因为Needle sharing而感染梅毒的机率已可说是相当少见了。\n梅毒螺旋体怕干燥、怕氧气，所以在人体外的生存能力极低，在干燥环境和阳光照射下很快便死亡，但在潮湿环境下可以生存较长时间。梅毒通常不会经由马桶座垫、日常活动、浴缸或分享餐具或衣物而传播。这主要是因为该细菌在离开人体后很快就会死亡，所以借由生物体来做为传播媒介是几乎不可能的。普通消毒剂如升汞（1:1000）和热肥皂水都能在短时间内消灭此细菌，煮沸也可将其立即杀死。\n##治疗\n###感染初期\n不复杂梅毒之首选治疗仍然是单一剂量的肌内注射长效性青霉素。多西环素和四环霉素则是对青霉素过敏的替代选择；然而，因有胎儿出生缺陷的风险，不建议孕妇使用此两药。梅毒对巨环内酯、利福平、克林霉素常有抗药性。头孢曲松，是第三代头孢菌素，和青霉素一样有效。建议治疗中的人在水泡未痊愈之前，避免进行性行为。\n###感染后期\n因青霉素G难以渗入中枢神经系统，对于神经性梅毒，则建议静脉注射大剂量青霉素最少10天。如果对青霉素过敏，可改用双钠盐或减敏疗程。若较晚治疗可连续三周每周一次肌肉注射青霉素G。在梅毒早期，如对盘尼西林过敏，可使用德霸霉素胶囊或四环霉素，但改用此两药会治疗较久。在此阶段治疗可限制疾病进展，但对已损伤处则仅有轻微的作用。\n###雅-赫氏反应\n治疗的其中一个副作用是雅-赫氏反应。此副作用经常一小时之内发生，并持续24小时发烧、肌肉痛、头痛和心跳加快。它是因为破裂的梅毒杆菌释放脂蛋白（内毒素），导致免疫系统释放细胞激素所引起的现象。\n##诊断\n临床上，很难从外观早期诊断出梅毒，须利用血液检查或显微镜检方能确诊，验血因较好操作，故较常用。然而，以上检查无法区分是在梅毒的哪一个分期。\n###血液检测\n血液测试分成非密螺旋体及密螺旋体试验。非密螺旋体试验通常用作初筛，包括venereal disease research laboratory（VDRL）及rapid plasma reagin（RPR）。然而这些试验有时会出现伪阳性，需要利用密螺旋体试验再做确认，例如treponemal pallidum particle agglutination（TP-PA）或fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test（FTA-Abs）。非密螺旋体试验伪阳性也可能出现在水痘或麻疹病毒感染的患者，或是淋巴瘤、肺结核、疟疾、心内膜炎、Connective tissue disease和妊娠等状况下。密螺旋体抗体试验通常在开始感染后2至5周即会呈现阳性反应，而神经性梅毒可借由已知梅毒感染下，大量的白血球（主要是淋巴球）及脑脊液中高蛋白质含量作诊断。\n###直接测试\n下疳患者的Serous fluid在暗视野显微镜下可能可以做立即性的诊断。在取得检体10分钟以内要做检验，灵敏度可达到接近80%，然而医院并不是随时备有这样的设备给检验人员使用，因此仅可用作确认，而非初步诊断。另外2种试验也可用于检验下疳患者的检体，direct fluorescent antibody（DFA）及核酸增幅试验。直接萤光抗体试验利用标有萤光素的抗体与特定的梅毒蛋白结合，而核酸增幅试验利用聚合酶链锁反应（PCR）等技术侦测梅毒特定基因序列的存在。这些检验方法并不受时间影响，因为病不需要活的菌体即可做检验。\n##预防\n截至2020年为止，并没有疫苗能有效地预防梅毒，不过正在研发一些根据梅毒螺旋体蛋白来降低病变的疫苗。避免与感染者的亲密身体接触可以有效降低梅毒传播机率，正确使用乳胶安全套也可以降低梅毒传播机率，但不等于能完全消弭相关风险。美国疾病管制局建议与未感染的性伴侣维持类似一夫一妻制的长期关系，并避免使用酒精及其他会增加危险性行为可能性的药物。\n只要孕妇在怀孕初期进行产检以及在感染梅毒后立即著手治疗，则可以预防新生儿感染先天性梅毒的机会，「United States Preventive Services Task Force」强烈建议所有的怀孕妇女都应进行全面性的筛检而世界卫生组织则建议妇女在初次以及妊娠第三期时的产检时实施梅毒筛检。若检验结果呈现阳性，相关单位会建议伴侣也应同样接受治疗。先天性梅毒在开发中国家依旧横行，因为多数的产妇并没有接受产检，而就算有产检的妇女，也不一定有进行过梅毒筛检。在已开发国家有时也会有零星个案，因为那些最容易感染梅毒的族群（例如因使用毒品等原因者），也是在怀孕期间最少受到妥善照顾的一群。目前有多项措施，是希望协助中低收入国家借由筛检，降低先天性梅毒的患病人数，而这些措施都已证实是相当有效。\n梅毒在许多国家都是列为法定传染病，包括加拿大、欧盟与美国都是如此。这就表示医护人员需要在必要时通报卫生主管机关，同样地，对该名患者的伴侣也有进行partner notification的义务，医师也须鼓励病患去寻求医疗协助。疾病管制局建议，有进行男男性交的男性每年至少需进行一次梅毒筛检。\n有许多方法可提高梅毒筛检的后续追踪，包含借由电子邮件和简讯做提醒。\n##流行病学\n梅毒于2013年感染约31.5万人，据信在1999年梅毒已感染了超过1.2亿的人，其中发展中国家占了90%的个案。每年约有70万至160万人受梅毒影响而造成流产、胎死腹中与先天性梅毒，在2010年期间约造成113,000人死亡，较1990年202,000人少一些。梅毒在撒哈拉以南非洲地区造成大略20%的新生儿死亡，娱乐性药物使用者、HIV感染者与男男性交者拥有较高的发生率。在美国，2007年男性引发梅毒的比率高过女性六倍，然而在1997年比例却是相当的。其中非裔美国人在2010年占了近半数的个案截至2014年，美国的梅毒感染数仍持续增加。\n梅毒在18与19世纪的欧洲十分流行，福楼拜发现梅毒在19世纪埃及的妓女间十分流行。在20世纪初直到1980、1990年代之间，已开发国家的梅毒感染状况，由于抗生素的广泛使用而降低。2000年起，梅毒在美国、加拿大、英国、澳洲与欧洲的感染率正逐渐升高，主要发生于男男性接触人群。然而，美国女性的感染率趋于稳定；英国女性的感染率虽有升高，但升高比率相较男性缓慢。自1990年代以来，中国与俄罗斯异性恋者感染率上升这得归咎于不安全性行为，例如滥交、招妓，以及性行为中较少使用防护措施。\n在未经治疗的情况下，死亡率约为8%至58%，其中男性死亡率较高。梅毒的症状在19、20世纪逐渐逐渐变得不严重，一部分是因为现今普遍且有效的治疗和螺旋体的病毒性下降，因为及早治疗，降低了并发症的出现。梅毒提高了爱滋病的传染风险达二到五倍，也常见到同时感染的情形（此比例在数个城市中心达到30–60%）。古巴在2015年成为全世界第一个根除梅毒垂直感染（由母亲对小孩的感染）的国家。\n## 历史\n### 欧洲\n梅毒的确切来源存在争议。目前仅能确定在欧洲接触到它之前，梅毒便存在于美洲大陆。争议的症结点是不确定梅毒在传入欧洲之前，是否也同时存在于其他地区只是未被辨识出来notetag|美国医学社会史家罗伊·波特（Roy Porter）著《剑桥医学史》（The Cambridge Illustrated History of Medicine）：哥伦布及其同伴常常被谴责为把梅毒从美洲携带到欧洲，并由此而传遍全世界。针对哥伦布的这一指责看来是真实可靠的，由美国亚特兰大艾莫瑞大学研究人员表示，新的基因证据支持哥伦布（Christopher Columbus）将梅毒从美洲新大陆带到欧洲的理论；研究人员针对梅毒系谱树（family tree）进行的基因分析显示，与梅毒最接近的是它的南美洲表亲，这种梅毒亚种细菌会造成一种名叫雅司病（yaws）的传染病。负责研究的生物演化学家哈珀（Kristin Harper）说：「部分人士认为梅毒确实是一种古老的疾病，我们最早的人类祖先可能就感染过这种疾病。另外部分人士认为梅毒来自新大陆。」“意大利似乎是第一个注意到西班牙的一些士兵曾经伴随哥伦布的第二次航海，因此产生了梅毒美洲发源的见解。。其中有「哥伦布假说」及「前哥伦布假说」两种较主要的假设：「哥伦布假说」认为梅毒会从美洲被传播到欧洲，和哥伦布远航所同行的船员们脱不了关系；另一种则是认为其实欧洲本来就存在梅毒，只是一直没有被人发现，直到哥伦布回到欧洲不久后，它才正式被发现。而这两种假说，分别被称为「哥伦布假说」与「前哥伦布假说」。不过目前现有证据而言较支持「哥伦布假说」，因为梅毒第一次在欧洲爆发的书面记录，记载于1494或1495年的义大利那不勒斯。当时法国正入侵义大利。也因为有人声称是法国人传播梅毒的，所以它最初被那不勒斯人称为「高卢病」。\n但也因为此病是在那不勒斯投降后，才在军队中爆发开来，因此也被称为那不勒斯病。\n1530年，意大利维罗纳的医生兼诗人吉罗拉莫·弗拉卡斯托罗发表了《西菲利斯：高卢病》（Syphilis, sive Morbus Gallicus），为一韵以长短格六步格所写的拉丁文诗。该诗描述意大利疾病肆虐情形，诗中主人翁是一位名叫西菲力士（Syphilus）的牧羊人notetag|西菲力士是希腊神话中绝代美人奈娥比（Niobe）的儿子，被阿波罗（Apollo）射死。此病在历史上也被称为「大痘」。患有高卢病（morbus gallicus），是一种性病。有人认为可能是第一位患有梅毒的人，于是便把这种疾病叫做Syphilus。\n梅毒螺旋体这种致病微生物，最早是由Fritz Schaudinn和Erich Hoffmann于1905年时所发现的。第一个有效治疗梅毒的洒尔佛散是保罗·埃尔利希在1910年发现的，在1943年证实此疗法有效。20世纪中发现抗生素并将其用在治疗中，在这之前一般会用水银治疗，并且是将患者隔离，治疗的副作用往往比疾病本身更严重。\n历史上像弗朗茨·舒伯特等名人可能都患有梅毒。尼采长期以来一直也被认为是因为后期梅毒而去世，但最近对此诊断已有提出质疑。\n### 中国\n16世纪以前，中国尚无梅毒的记载，1498年，梅毒出现于印度。大约于1505年，梅毒由葡萄牙商人传入广东岭南一带，当时称“广东疮”、“杨梅疮”，此后梅毒向内陆传播。明代陈司成著《霉疮秘录》被认为是中国第一部论述梅毒最详尽的专著，明代李时珍著《本草纲目》详细记载了梅毒流行情况。\n1636年，陈司成在《霉疮秘录》一书记载如下：“独见霉疮一症，往往外治无法，细观经书，古未言及，究其根源，始于舞会之未，起于岭南之地，致使蔓延通国，流祸甚广”，“一感其毒，酷烈匪常……”，“入髓沦肌，流经走络，或攻脏腑，或寻孔窍……，始生下疳继而骨痛，眉发脱落，甚则目盲，耳闭”。“甚则传染妻孥，丧身绝良，移患于子女。”\n##艺术与文学\n目前已知最早描绘梅毒形象的是杜勒于1490年代所绘制的版画《梅毒患者》，画中人物的形象据信是一位国土佣仆（北欧佣兵）。19世纪有关「红颜祸水」和「蛇蝎女郎」的传闻，有可能有部分与梅毒流行有关，如当时的济慈所写的《La Belle Dame sans Merci》，即是该时代背景的经典范例之作。\n画家斯特拉达努斯在1580年代曾绘制画作，描述一位富人接受有关愈创树的治疗，此画作的标题是「准备和使用愈创木酚来治愈梅毒」（Preparation and Use of Guayaco for Treating  Syphilis）。此画作是在一系列庆祝发现新大陆的画作中，也可以表示对当时的欧洲贵族而言，梅毒的治疗是多么的重要。在图画中，有四名仆人在准备药汁，医生正在检视，而病人正在饮用药汁。\n##社会与文化\n###艺术与文学\n艺术家Stradanus在1580年左右画了幅画，描绘一名富人接受以热带愈疮木进行的梅毒治疗。该作品的名称为「备置及使用愈创木来治疗梅毒」。该艺术家选择在一系列作品中纳入此图像来庆祝发现新世界，这显示出对当时的欧洲菁英份子而言，梅毒的治疗（即使无效）有多重要。在这幅色彩丰富且细节清楚的作品中，描绘了4名正在准备药汁的仆人，而一名医生在盯着倒霉的病人喝药的同时藏了东西在背后。\n###塔斯基吉和危地马拉研究\n二十世纪在美国进行的塔斯基吉梅毒试验，是相关骇人听闻且冲击医学伦理底线的实验。这项计划是由美国卫生与公共服务部所资助，由塔斯基吉研究机构在阿拉巴马州的塔斯基吉进行的医学实验。这项计划开始于1932年，那时候梅毒还是大规模的流行疾病，还没找到安全又有效的治疗方法。此计划的设计，是为了研究感染梅毒后的发病历程。1947年，人们发现，盘尼西林可治疗初期的梅毒感染，也开始广泛的使用，不过对于较晚期梅毒病患的效果，却仍混沌不明。研究机构的负责人没有提供受试者盘尼西林，不过此说法仍有争议，因为后来有发现部分的个案曾有接受盘尼西林治疗的纪录。\n在1960年代，美籍律师Peter Buxtun写信给主导塔斯基吉梅毒试验的机关美国疾病控制与预防中心。信中提到有数以百计的黑人病患本可治愈，却因为这个实验丧生及衍生的道德问题。该局却回信提到，这个计划必须持续到所有的患者死去为止。到了1972年，邦司顿投书主流媒体，造成了社会一片哗然。也因为这样，这个计划被迫终止，这场诉讼耗费九百万美元，而美国国会也成立了专责委员会，立法阻止相似的事件在未来再度发生。\n1994年成立了塔斯基吉梅毒试验专责委员会，由于委员会的努力，梅毒试验的幸存者在1997年5月16日受邀前往白宫，由美国总统柯林顿代表政府为这项研究向幸存者致歉。\n1946年到1948年在危地马拉也有进行由美国资助的梅毒人体试验，是在Juan José Arévalo在危地马拉执政时和一些卫生部长和官员的合作所下进行。医生让士兵、犯人和精神病患在没有知情同意的情形下，感染梅毒及其他性传染病，再用抗生素进行治疗。美国在2010年10月正式向危地马拉为此人体试验致歉。"], "selected_questions": ["梅毒主要通过什么途径传播？", "如何预防梅毒的传播？", "梅毒是什么疾病？"],

{"name": "四书五经", "documents": ["## 四书五经\n四书五经是四书和五经的合称，是中国儒家的经典书籍。四书又称为四子书，是指《论语》《孟子》《大学》《中庸》。五经是《诗经》《尚书》《礼记》《周易》和《春秋》。\n在战国时原有「六经」的说法，为《诗》《书》《礼》《乐》《易》和《春秋》，排列顺序为《庄子》的《天下》、《天运》两篇的文内顺序，被出土郭店楚简所记“六经”名与顺序印证。项羽火烧咸阳宫，除《周易》作为术数之书得以幸免，其余四种皆毁。汉初，汉儒凭记忆与民间幸存之书恢复内容，汉武帝接续文景时已定官学的三种，将其全部定为官学，设立“五经博士”，五经之名正式确定。汉代整理的“五经”，如果按《汉书·艺文志》“六艺略”排列，六种为《易》《书》《诗》《礼》《春秋》以及《论语》《孝经》《小学》（汉代习称“五”，一般不包含“《乐》”）。六经中的《乐经》很早就亡佚了，《乐经》在汉代是否存在至今有争议NoteTag|已知最新实际证据为河南方面报道的河南博物院藏疑似《乐经》残石（该院另同时藏有三体石经残石，不可混淆）。，《汉书·艺文志》中无此书的记载。\n##“四书五经”的由来\n### 五经\n战国时已有以《诗》《书》《礼》《乐》《易》《春秋》为“六经”的说法。《庄子·天运》：“孔子对老聃说：‘我研究《诗》《书》《礼》《乐》《易》《春秋》六经，自以为时间很长了。’”当时称为“经”的不仅是儒家著作。《庄子·天下》说墨家弟子都读《墨经》，《荀子》中引有《道经》。经也并非都是孔子所著。后来“经”字神秘化，各宗教经典都称为“经”了。《诗》《书》《礼》《乐》《易》《春秋》六经中的《乐经》很早就亡佚了，《汉书·艺文志》中已无此书的记载。其他五种著作就称为“五经”。唐朝时因唐太宗令颜师古考订《五经定本》，令孔颖达等撰《五经正义》，其孔撰官修的《礼记正义》的颁行，突出了《三礼》中《礼记》的地位（参与《礼记正义》编撰的贾公彦，还主持完成了《仪礼正义》的撰作）。\n###四书\n南宋的理学家朱熹取《礼记》中的《中庸》《大学》两篇文章单独成书，与纪录孔子言行的《论语》、孟轲所撰写的《孟子》合为「四书」，依照其想法，《中庸》出自子思、《大学》源于曾子；因称它们分别出于早期儒家的四位代表性人物曾参、子思、孔子、孟子，所以称为《四子书》（也称《四子》），简称为《四书》。南宋光宗绍熙元年（1190年），朱熹统整这四部书，予以集注，在福建漳州刊刻《四书章句集注》。他认为：「先读《大学》，以定其规模；次读《论语》，以定其根本；次读《孟子》，以观其发越；次读《中庸》，以求古人之微妙处。」并曾说：「《四子》，《六经》之阶梯。」同时《孟子》也成为经书的一部分，合称十三经。\n###四书五经的顺序\n《庄子》《淮南子》、董仲舒《春秋繁露》《礼记》和《史记》中提到五经时的顺序都是《诗》《书》《礼》《易》《春秋》，到东汉时《汉书》《说文解字》都变成了《易》《书》《诗》《礼》《春秋》。\n四书的顺序最初也不确定，最终由朱熹确定为《大学》《中庸》《论语》和《孟子》。\n##四书简介\n###《大学》\n《大学》原本是《礼记》中一篇，在南宋前从未单独刊印。传为孔子后学作。自唐代韩愈、李翱维护道统而推崇《大学》（与《中庸》），至北宋二程百般褒奖宣扬，甚至称“《大学》，孔氏之遗书而初学入德之门也”，再到南宋朱熹继承二程思想，便把《大学》从《礼记》中抽出来，与《论语》《孟子》《中庸》并列，到朱熹撰《四书章句集注》时，便成了《四书》之一。按朱熹和宋代另一位著名学者程颐的看法，《大学》是孔子及其门徒留下来的遗书，是儒学的入门读物。所以，朱熹把它列为“四书”之首。\n###《中庸》\n《中庸》原来也是《礼记》中一篇，一般认为它出于孔子的孙子子思（前483年－前402年）之手，《史记·孔子世家》称“子思作《中庸》”。单篇流传可考者，《汉书‧艺文志》载有《中庸说》二篇，《隋书‧经籍志》则载有梁武帝撰《中庸讲疏》一卷。自唐代韩愈、李翱维护道统而推崇《中庸》（与《大学》），至北宋二程百般褒奖宣扬，甚至认为《中庸》是“孔门传收授心法”，再到南宋朱熹继承二程思想，便把《中庸》从《礼记》中抽出来，与《论语》《孟子》《大学》并列，到朱熹撰《四书章句集注》时，便成了《四书》之一。从《中庸》和《孟子》的基本观点来看，也大体上相同的。不过，现存的《中庸》，已经经过秦代儒者的修改，大致写定于秦统一全国后不久。所以每篇方式已不同于《大学》，不是取正义开头的两个字为题，而是撮取文章的中心内容为题了。\n###《论语》\n《论语》是记载孔子及其学生言行的一部经典。孔子（前551年——前479年），名丘，字仲尼，春秋时鲁国陬邑（今山东曲阜）人。儒家学派创始人，中国古代最著名的思想家、政治家、教育家，对中国思想文化的发展有极其深远的影响。《论语》大约在春秋战国时期成书，是后来孔子的学生及其再传学生所记录整理。《论语》是记载孔子及其学生讨论内容的一部书。《论语》涉及哲学、政治、经济、教育、文艺等诸多方面，内容非常丰富，是儒学最主要的经典。在表达上，《论语》语言精炼而形象生动，是语录体散文的典范。在编排上，《论语》没有严格的编纂体例，每一条就是一章，集章为篇，篇、章之间并无紧密联系，只是大致归类，并有重复章节出现。到汉代时，有《鲁论语》（20篇）、《齐论语》（22篇）、《古文论语》（21篇）三种《论语》版本流传。东汉末年，郑玄以《鲁论语》为底本，参考《齐论语》和《古文论语》编校成一个新的本子，并加以注释。郑玄的注本流传后，《齐论语》和《古文论语》便逐渐亡佚了。以后各代注释《论语》的版本主要有：三国时魏国何晏《论语集解》，南北朝梁代皇侃《论语义疏》，宋代邢晏《论语注疏》、朱熹《论语集注》，清代刘宝楠《论语正义》等。\n###《孟子》\n《孟子》是记载孟子及其学生言行的一部书。孟子（约前372-前289年），名轲，字子舆，战国中期邹国（今山东邹县东南人），离孔子的故乡曲阜不远。是著名的思想家、政治家、教育家，孔子学说的继承者。和孔子一样，孟子也曾带领学生游历魏、齐、宋、鲁、滕、薛等国，并一度担任过齐宣王的客卿。由于他的政治主张也与孔子的一样不被重用，所以便回到家乡聚徒讲学，与学生万章等人著书立说，“序《诗》《书》，述仲尼之意，作《孟子》七篇。”（《史记·孟子荀卿列传》）赵岐在《孟子题辞》中把《孟子》与《论语》相比，认为《孟子》是“拟圣而作”。所以，尽管《汉书·艺文志》仅仅把《孟子》放在诸子略中，视为子书，但实际上在汉代人的心目中已经把它看作辅助“经书”的“传”书了。汉文帝把《论语》《孝经》《孟子》《尔雅》各置博士，便叫“传记博士”。到五代后蜀时，后蜀主孟昶命令人楷书十一经刻石，其中包括了《孟子》，这可能是《孟子》列入“经书”的开始。到南宋孝宗时，朱熹编《四书》列入了《孟子》，正式把《孟子》提到了非常高的地位。元、明以后又成为科举考试的内容，更是读书人的必读书了。\n##五经简介\n###《诗经》\n《诗经》在先秦称《诗》或《诗三百》，是中国第一本诗歌总集。汇集了春秋中期前的诗歌三百零五篇。《诗经》认为是由孔子所编定。但学者认为是由鲁国乐官所编。《诗》分“风”、“雅”、“颂”三部分，“风”为土风歌谣，“雅”为西周王畿的正声雅乐，“颂”为上层社会宗庙祭祀的舞曲歌辞。此书广泛地反映了当时社会生活各方面，被誉为古代社会的人生百科全书，对后世影响深远。汉时有鲁、齐、韩三家言《诗》，后来又有《毛诗》，只有《毛诗》流传至今。\n###《尚书》\n《尚书》古时称《书》，是记言记事的简册泛称，主要记载帝王言论及活动。到孔子时代，《书》大约只残存百余篇，诸子百家多有引用，孔子作了整理。秦朝时民间所藏的《书》基本上被焚毁，国家所藏的《书》也毁于战火。汉文帝时，秦朝博士伏生讲授保存下来的28篇《尚书》，用当时通行的隶书写成，称为《今文尚书》。《尚书》的称谓中“尚”便指“上古”，记载上起尧舜，下至东周，是现存最早的一部历史文献汇编，基本内容是古代帝王的文告和君臣谈话内容的记录。\n汉武帝末年。鲁共王拆除孔子的旧宅，从墙壁夹层中得到用秦代以前的大篆（籀文）写成的《尚书》，称为《古文尚书》，除与《今文尚书》相同的28篇外，多出16篇。西晋后，《尚书》全部散佚。东晋时梅赜献《孔传古文尚书》，包括与《今文尚书》相同的28篇(但析为33篇)和另外25篇，遂流传至今。现认为《孔传古文尚书》是伪书。\n###《礼记》\n《礼记》亦称《小戴礼记》，共49篇，是先秦到秦汉时期的礼学文献选编。最初为西汉的戴圣所纂，但非出于一时一人之手。戴圣本是今文《仪礼》博士，《仪礼》仅17篇，所记大多为士礼，故汉朝的儒家学者杂采当时能见到的各种文献以为己用。其内容较为驳杂，大致有记述礼节、记述政令、解释《仪礼》、记孔子言论、记述孔门及时人事、礼节考证、通论礼意或学术、记述制度、记述掌故、杂记等十种。东汉时郑玄为之作注，其文字较为通畅易读，流传较广。唐朝时取代《仪礼》的地位。\n###《周易》\n《周易》也称《易》《易经》，本是古代占卜之书，包括《经》和《传》两部分。《经》文叙述了六十四卦三百八十四爻。《传》为解释卦名、卦义、卦辞、爻辞的七种十篇，称为“十翼”“《易传》”“《易大传》”。八卦和六十四卦的出现当在西周以前的远古年代，有学者认为《经》的编订在商末周初，《传》作于春秋战国，非一人一时之作。古人认为经伏羲、周文王、周公、孔子等历代圣人编定而成。内容广泛记录了西周社会各方面，包含史料价值、思想价值和文学价值。其外层神秘，而内蕴的哲理至深至弘。\n###《春秋》\n《春秋》本是记事史书的通称，但流传下来的只有鲁国的《春秋》。其编者一般认为是孔子，鲁哀公十四年（公元前481年）西狩获麟，于是孔子有感于自己的主张不行于天下，于是取鲁国《春秋》进行加工编撰。全书纪事从鲁隐公元年（公元前722年）到鲁哀公十四年（公元前479年），共242年。后人因此称东周前期为春秋时期。其书用鲁国纪元兼记各诸侯国事，是现存最早的编年史。记事的目的是提倡道义和“礼”。而春秋本身的文字极为精简，所以后世流传有《公羊传》《谷梁传》《左传》三传来解释原文。\n##影响\n自西汉以来，经书被确立为国家经典，宋代以来又被定为科举用书，成为读书人之必读。故其地位崇高，影响巨大。十三经不过65万字，而关于它们的注解达到三亿字左右，为原文的四、五百倍。\n朱熹著《四书章句集注》，具有划时代意义。汉唐是《五经》时代，宋后是《四书》时代。南宋后各朝皆以《四书》列为科举考试范围，因而造就《四书》独特的地位。甚至宋朝以后《四书》已凌驾《五经》的地位。\n元仁宗延祐二年时确定以朱熹的《四书章句集注》为科试范畴，从此以后中国的科举考试便在《四书集注》的范围内出题。虞集称将朱学“定为国是”使“学者尊信，无敢疑贰。”（虞集《道园学古录》卷39〈跋济宁李璋所刻《九经》《四书》〉）明成祖敕胡广纂修《四书大全》、《性理大全》，主攻朱子之学。《明史》卷70〈选举志．二〉载：明初“颁科举定式，初场试《四书》义三道，经义四道。《四书》主朱子《集注》，《易》主程《传》、朱子《本义》，《书》主蔡氏《传》及古注疏，《诗》主朱子《集传》……”。朱彝尊《经义考》称四书如“日星丽天，万象昭著”。陈确〈与黄太冲书〉云：“惟是世儒习气，敢于诬孔、孟，必不敢倍程、朱”。", "“四书”与“五经”之合称。四书之名始于南宋朱熹，五经之名则早始于汉武帝之时。向为历代儒学子首要研学之书经。\n\n四书即《大学》《中庸》《论语》《孟子》。五经即《诗经》《尚书》《礼记》《周易》《春秋》。《春秋》盖由微言大义，故常与其注书《左氏传》《公羊传》《谷梁传》等合集。\n\n## 四书\n\n朱熹分别为这四部书作了注释，其中，《大学》《中庸》的注释称为“章句”，《论语》《孟子》的注 释因为引用他人的说法较多，所以称为“集注”。值得注意的是， 朱熹所编定的《四书》次序本来是《大学》《论语》《孟子》《中庸》，是按照由浅入深进修的顺序排列的。后人因为《大学》《中庸》的篇幅较短，为了刻写出版的方便，而把《中庸》提到《论语》之前，成了前年通行的《大学》《中庸》《论语》《孟子》顺序。\n由于朱熹注释的《四书》既融会了前人的学说，又有他自己的独特见解，切于世用；又由于以程颢、程颐兄弟和朱熹为代表的“程朱理学”地位的日益上升，所以，朱熹死后，朝廷便将他所编定注释的《四书》审定为官书，从此盛行起来，到元代延佑年间（1314年—1320年）恢复科举考试，正式把出题范围限制在朱注《四书》之内。明、清沿袭元制，衍出“八股文”考试制度，题目也都是出自朱注《四书》。《四书》不仅是儒学经典，还是每个读书人的必读书。在近代，《四书》还被编入小学、中学教科书。\n\n### 《大学》\n\n《大学》原本是《礼记》中一篇，在南宋前从未单独刊印。传为孔子弟子曾参（前505年—前434年）作。自唐代韩愈、李翱维护道统而推崇《大学》（与《中庸》），至北宋二程百般褒奖宣扬，甚至称“《大学》，孔氏之遗书而初学入德之门也”，再到南宋朱熹继承二程思想，便把《大学》从《礼记》中抽出来，与《论语》《孟子》《中庸》并列，到朱熹撰《四书章句集注》时，便成了《四书》之一。按朱熹和宋代另一位著名学者程颐的看法，《大学》是孔子及其门徒留下来的遗书，是儒家学派的入门读物。所以，朱熹把它列为“四书”之首。\n大学之道，在明明德，在亲民，在止于至善。知止而后有定，定而后能静，静而后能安，安而后能虑，虑而后能得。物有本末，事有终始，知所先后，则近道矣。古之欲明明德于天下者，先治其国，欲治其国者，先齐其家；欲齐其家者，先修其身；欲修其身者，先正其心；欲正其心者，先诚其意；欲诚其意者，先致其知，致知在格物。物格而后知至，知至而后意诚，意诚而后心正，心正而后身修，身修而后家齐，家齐而后国治，国治而后天下平。自天子以至于庶人，壹是皆以修身为本。其本乱而末治者，否矣。其所厚者薄，而其所薄者厚，未之有也。此谓知本，此谓知之至也。\n所谓诚其意者，毋自欺也。如恶恶臭，如好好色，此之谓自谦。故君子必慎其独也。小人闲居为不善，无所不至，见君子而后厌然，拚其不善，而著其善。人之视己，如见其肝肺然，则何益矣。此谓诚于中形于外。故君子必慎其独也。曾子曰：“十目所视，十手所指，其严乎！”富润屋，德润身，心广体胖，故君子必诚其意。诗云：“瞻彼淇澳，绿竹猗猗，有斐君子，如切如磋，如琢如磨，瑟兮僩兮，赫兮喧兮，有斐君子，终不可煊兮。”如切如磋者，道学也；如琢如磨者，自修也；瑟兮僩兮者，恂栗也；赫兮喧兮者，威仪也；有斐君子，终不可煊兮者，道盛德至善，民之不能忘也。诗云：“于戏！前王不忘。”君子贤其贤而亲其亲，小人乐其乐而利其利，此以没世不忘也。康诰曰：“克明德。”大甲曰：“顾是天之明命。”帝典曰：“克明峻德。”皆自明也。汤之盘铭曰：“苟日新，日日新，又日新。”康诰曰：“作新民。”诗云：“周虽旧邦，其命维新。”是故君子无所不用其极。诗云：“邦畿千里，惟民所止。”诗云：“缗蛮黄鸟，止于丘隅。”子曰：“于止，知其所止，可以人而不如鸟乎？”诗云：“穆穆文王，于缉熙敬止。”为人君，止于仁，为人臣，止于敬，为人子，止于孝，为人父，止于慈，与国人交，止于信。子曰：“听讼，吾犹人也，必也使无讼乎！”无情者不得尽其辞，大畏民志，此谓知本。\n所谓修身在正其心者，身有所忿惕则不得其正，有所恐惧则不得其正，有所好乐则不得其正，有所忧患则不得其正。心不在焉，视而不见，听而不闻，食而不知其味，此谓修身在正其心。所谓齐其家在修其身者，人之其所亲爱而辟焉，之其所贱恶而辟焉，之其所敬畏而辟焉，之其所哀矜而辟焉，之其所敖惰而辟焉，故好而知其恶，恶而知其美者，天下鲜矣。故谚有之曰：“人莫之其子之恶，莫知其苗之硕。”此谓身不修，不可以齐其家。\n所谓治国必齐其家者，其家不可教，而能教人者无之。故君子不出家而成教于国。孝者，所以事君也；弟者，所以事长也；慈者，所以使众也。康诰曰：“如保赤子。”心诚求之，虽不中，不远矣。未有学养子而后嫁者也。一家仁，一国兴仁；一家让，一国兴让；一人贪戾，一国作乱，其机如此。此谓一言贲事，一人定国。尧舜率天下以仁，而民从之；桀纣率天下以暴，而民从之。其所令，反其所好，而民不从。是故君子有诸己而后求诸人，无诸己而后非诸人。所藏乎身不恕，而能喻诸人者，未之有也。故治国在齐其家。诗云：“桃之夭夭，其叶蓁蓁，之子于归，宜其家人。”宜其家人而后可以教国人。诗云：“宜兄宜弟。”宜兄宜弟，而后可以教国人。诗云：“其仪不忒，正是四国。”其为父子兄弟足法，而后民法之也。此谓治国在齐其家。\n所谓平天下在治其国者，上老老而民兴孝，上长长而民兴弟，上恤孤而民不倍，是以君子有絜矩之道也。所恶于上，毋以使下；所恶于下，毋以事上；所恶于前，毋以先后；所恶于后，毋以从前；所恶于右，毋以交于左；所恶于左，毋以交于右，此之谓挈矩之道。诗云：“乐只君子，民之父母。”民之所好好之，民之所恶恶之，此之谓民之父母。诗云：“节彼南山，维石岩岩，赫赫师尹，民具尔瞻。”有国者不可以不慎，辟则为天下僇矣。诗云：“殷之未丧师，克配上帝，仪监于殷，峻命不易。”道得众，则得国；失众，则失国。是故君子先慎乎德，有德此有人，有人此有土，有土此有财，有财此有用。德者本也，财者末也。外本内末，争民施夺。是故财聚则民散，财散则民聚。是故言悖而出者，亦悖而入；货悖而入者，亦悖而出。康诰曰：“唯命不于常。”道善则得之，不善则失之矣。楚书曰：“楚国无以为宝，惟善以为宝。”舅犯曰：“亡人无以为宝，仁亲为宝。”\n《秦誓》曰：“若有一介臣，断断兮无他技，其心休休焉，其为有容焉。人之有技，若己有之；人之彦圣，其心好之，不啻若自其口出。实能容之，以能保我子孙黎民，尚亦有利哉！人之有技，媢嫉以恶之，人之彦圣，而违之俾不通。实不能容，以不能保我子孙黎民，亦曰殆哉！”唯仁人放流之，迸诸四夷，不与同中国。此谓唯仁人为能爱人，能恶人。见贤而不能举，举而不能先，命也。见不善而不能退，退而不能远，过也。好人之所恶，恶人之所好，是谓拂人之性，菑必逮夫身。是故君子有大道，必忠信以得之，骄泰以失之。生财有大道，生之者众，食之者寡，为之者疾，用之者舒，则财恒足矣。仁者以财发身，不仁者以身发财。未有上好仁，而下不好义者也；未有好义，其事不终者也，未有府库财，非其财者也。孟献子曰：“畜马乘，不察于鸡豚；伐冰之家，不畜牛羊；百乘之家，不畜聚敛之臣。与其有聚敛之臣，宁有盗臣。”此谓国不以利为利，以义为利也。长国家而务财用者，必自小人矣，彼为善之。小人之使为国家，菑害并至，虽有善者，亦无如之何矣。此谓国家不以利为利，以义为利也。\n\n### 《中庸》\n\n在南宋前从未单独刊印，一般认为它出于孔子的孙子子思（前483年－前402年）之手，《史记·孔子世家》称“子思作《中庸》”。自唐代韩愈、李翱维护道统而推崇《中庸》（与《大学》），至北宋二程百般褒奖宣扬，甚至认为《中庸》是“孔门传收授心法”，再到南宋朱熹继承二程思想，便把《中庸》从《礼记》中抽出来，与《论语》《孟子》《大学》并列，到朱熹撰《四书章句集注》时，便成了《四书》之一。从《中庸》和《孟子》的基本观点来看，也大体上相同的。不过，现存的《中庸》，已经经过秦代儒者的修改，大致写定于秦统一全国后不久。所以每篇方式已不同于《大学》，不是取正义开头的两个字为题，而是撮取文章\n子路问强。子曰：“南方之强与，北方之强与，抑而强与？宽柔以教，不报无道，南方之强也，君子居之。衽金革，死而不厌，北方之强也，而强者居之。故君子和而不流，强哉矫！中立而不倚，强哉矫！国有道，不变塞焉，强哉矫！国无道，至死不变，强哉矫！\n子曰：素隐行怪，后世有述焉，吾弗为之矣。君子遵道而行，半途而废，吾弗能已矣。君子依乎中庸，遁世不见知而不悔，唯圣者能之。\n君子之道费而隐，夫妇之愚，可以与知焉，及其至也，虽圣人亦有所不知焉；夫妇之不肖，可以能行焉，及其至也，虽圣人亦有所不能焉。天地之大也，人犹有所憾，故君子语大，天下莫能载焉，语小，天下莫能破焉。诗云：鸢飞戾天，鱼跃于渊。言其上下察也。君子之道，造端乎夫妇，及其至也，察乎天地。\n子曰：道不远人，人之为道而远人，不可以为道。诗云：伐柯伐柯，其则不远。执柯以伐柯，睨而视之，犹以为远。故君子以人治人，改而止。忠恕违道不远。施诸己而不愿，亦勿施于人。君子之道四，丘未能一焉。所求乎子，以事父，未能也；所求乎臣，以事君，未能也；所求乎弟，以事兄，未能也；所求乎朋友，先施之，未能也。庸德之行，庸言之谨，有所不足，不敢不勉。有余不敢尽，言顾行，行顾言，君子胡不造造尔。\n君子素其位而行，不愿乎其外。素富贵行乎富贵，素贫贱行乎贫贱，素夷狄行乎夷狄，素患难行乎患难。君子无入而不自得焉。在上位不陵下，在下位不援上，正己而不求于人则无怨，上不怨天，下不尤人。故君子居易以俟命，小人行险以侥幸。子曰：射有似乎君子，失诸正皓，反求诸身。\n君子之道，譬如行远，必自迩；譬如登高，必自卑。诗曰：妻子好合，如鼓瑟琴，兄弟既翕，和乐且耽。宜尔室家，宜尔妻孥。\n子曰：鬼神之为德，其盛矣乎。视之而弗见，听之而弗闻，体物而不可遗。使天下之人，齐明盛服，以承祭祀。洋洋乎如在其上，如在其左右。诗曰：神之格思，不可度思，吲可射思。夫微之显，诚之不可拚如此夫。\n子曰：舜其大孝也与。德为圣人，尊为天子，富有四海之内，宗庙飨之，子孙保之。故大德必得其位，必得其禄，必得其名，必得其寿。故天之生物，必因其才而笃焉。故栽者培之，倾则覆之。诗曰：嘉乐君子，宪宪令德，宜民宜人，受禄于天，保佑命之，自天申之。\n子曰：无忧者其唯文王乎。以王季为父，以武王为子，父作之，子述之。武王攒大王、王季、文王之绪，壹戎衣而有天下，身不失天下之显名，尊为天子，富有四海之内，宗庙飨之，子孙保之。武王末受命，周公成文武之德，追王大王、王季，上祀先公以天子之礼。斯礼也，达乎诸侯大夫及士庶人。父为大夫，子为士，葬以大夫，祭以士；父为士，子为大夫，葬以士，祭以大夫。期之丧，达乎大夫；三年之丧，达乎天子；父母之丧，无贵贱，一也。\n子曰：武王、周公其达孝矣乎。夫孝者，善继人之志，善述人之事者也。春秋，修其祖庙，陈其宗器，设其裳衣，荐其时食。祖庙之礼，所以序昭穆也。序爵，所以辨贵贱也；序事，所以辨贤也；旅酬下为上，所以逮贱也；燕毛，所以序齿也。践其位，行其礼，奏其乐，敬其所尊，爱其所亲，事死如事生，事亡如事存，孝之至也。郊社之礼，所以事上帝也；祖庙之礼，所以祀乎其先也。明乎郊社之礼，谛尝之义，治国，其如示诸掌乎？\n哀公问政，子曰：“文武之政，布在方策。其人存，则其政举。其人亡，则其政息。”人道敏政，地道敏树。夫政也者，蒲庐也。故为政在人，取人以身，修身以道，修道以仁。仁者，人也，亲亲为大。义者，宜也，尊贤为大。亲亲之杀，尊贤之等，礼所生也。在下位，不获乎上，民不可得而治矣。故君子不可以不修身，思修身不可以不事亲，思事亲不可以不知人，思知人不可以不知天。天下之达道五，所以行之者三。曰君臣也，父子也，夫妇也，昆弟也，朋友也，五者天下之达道也。知、仁、勇三者，天下之达德也。所以行之者一也。或生而知之，或学而知之，或困而知之，及其知之一也。或安而行之，或利而行之，或勉强而行之，及其成功一也。子曰：“好学近乎知，力行近乎仁，知耻近乎勇。”知斯三者，则知所以修身，知所以修身，则知所以治人，之所以治人，则知所以治天下国家矣。\n凡为天下国家有九经，曰：修身也，尊贤也，亲亲也，敬大臣也，体群臣也，子庶民也，来百工也，柔远人也，怀诸侯也。修身则道立，尊贤则不惑，亲亲则诸父昆弟不怨，敬大臣则不眩，体群臣则士之报礼重，子庶民则百姓劝，来百工则财用足，柔远人则四方归之，怀诸侯则天下畏之。齐明盛服，非礼不动，所以修身也。去谗远色，贱货而贵德，所以劝贤也。尊其位，重其禄，同其好恶，所以劝亲亲也。官盛任使，所以劝大臣也。忠信重禄，所以劝士也。时使薄敛，所以劝百姓也。日省月试，既禀称事，所以劝百工也。送往迎来，嘉善而矜不能，所以柔远人也。继绝世，举废国，治乱持危，朝聘以时，厚往而薄来，所以怀诸侯也。凡为天下国家有九经，所以行之者一也。凡事豫则立，不豫则废。言前定则不怯，事前定则不困，行前定则不疚，道前定则不穷。在下位，不获乎上，民不可得而治矣。获乎上有道，不信乎朋友，不获乎上矣。信乎朋友有道，不顺乎亲，不信乎朋友矣。顺乎亲有道，反诸身不诚，不顺乎亲矣。诚身有道，不明乎善，不诚乎身矣。诚者，天之道也；诚之者，人之道也。诚者不勉而中，不思而得，从容中道圣人也。诚之者，择善而固执之者也。博学之，审问之，慎思之，明辨之，笃行之。有弗学，学之弗能弗措也。有弗问，问之弗知弗措也。人一能之，己百之，人十能之，己千之。果能此道矣，虽愚必明，虽柔必强。\n自诚明，谓之性；自明诚，谓之教。诚则明矣，明则诚矣。\n唯天下之至诚，为能尽其性，能尽其性，则能尽人之性，能尽人之性，则能尽物之性，能尽物之性，则可以赞天地之化育，可以赞天地之化育，则可以与天地参矣。\n其次致曲，曲能有诚。诚则形，形则著，著则明，明则动，动则变，变则化。唯天下至诚为能化。\n至诚之道，可以前知。国家将兴，必有祯祥；国家将亡，必有妖孽。见乎蓍龟，动乎四体。祸福将至，善，必先知之，不善，必先知之。故至诚如神。\n诚者，自成也，而道自道也。诚者物之终始，不诚无物。是故君子诚之为贵。诚者非成己而已也，所以成物也。成己，仁也；成物，知也。性之德也，合内外之道也。故时措之宜也。\n故至诚无息，不息则久，久则征，征则悠远，悠远则博厚，博厚则高明。博厚所以载物也，高明所以覆物也，悠久所以成物也。博厚配地，高明配天，悠久无疆。如此者，不见而章，不动而变，无为而成。天地之道，可一言而尽也。其为物不二，则其生物不测。天地之道，博也，厚也，高也，明也，悠也，久也。今夫天，斯昭昭之多，及其无穷也，日月星辰系焉，万物覆焉。今夫地，一撮土之多，及其广厚，载华岳而不重，振河海而不泄。今夫山，一卷石之多，及其广大，草木生之，禽兽居之，宝藏兴焉。今夫水，一勺之多，及其不测，鼋鼍蛟龙鱼鳖生焉，货财殖焉。诗云：维天之命，于穆不已。盖曰天之所以为天也，于乎不显？文王之德之纯，盖曰文王之所以为文也，纯亦不已。\n大哉圣人之道，洋洋乎发育文王，峻极于天。优优大哉，礼仪三百，威仪三千，待其人而后行。故曰：苟不至德，至道不凝焉。故君子尊德性而道问学，致广大而尽精微，极高明而道中庸，温故而知新，敦厚以崇礼。是故居上不骄，为下不倍。国有道，其言足以兴，国无道，其默足以容。诗曰：既明且哲，以保其身。其此之谓与？\n子曰：“愚而好自用，贱而好自专，生乎今之世，反乎古之道。如此者，灾及其身也。”非天子，不议礼，不制度，不考文。今天下，车同轨，书同文，行同伦。虽有其位，苟无其德，不敢作礼乐焉。虽有其德，苟无其位，亦不敢作礼乐焉。子曰：“吾说夏礼，杞不足征也；吾学殷礼，有宋存焉；吾学周礼，今用之，吾从周。”\n王天下有三重焉，其寡过矣乎！上焉者，虽善无征，无征不信，不信民弗从。下焉者，虽善不尊，不尊不信，不信民弗从。故君子之道，本诸身，征诸庶民，考诸三王而不缪，建诸天地而不悖，质诸鬼神而无疑，百世以俟圣人而不惑。质诸鬼神而无疑，知天也；百世以俟圣人而不惑，知人也。是故君子动而世为天下道，行而世为天下法，言而世为天下则。远之则有望，近之则不厌。诗曰：在彼无恶，在此无射，庶几夙夜，以永终誉。君子未有不如此而誉于天下者也。\n仲尼祖述养生，宪章文武，上律天时，下袭水土。辟如天地之无不持载，无不覆帱；辟如四时之错行，如日月之代明。万物并育而不相害，道并行而不相悖。小德川流，大德敦化。此天地之所以为大也。\n唯天下至圣，为能聪明睿知，足以有临也。宽裕温柔，足以有容也。发强刚毅，足以有执也。齐庄中正，足以有敬也。文理密察，足以有别也。溥博渊泉，而时出之。溥博如天，渊泉如渊。见而民莫不敬，言而民莫不信，行而民莫不说。是以声名洋溢乎中国，施及蛮貊。舟车所至，人力所通，天之所覆，地之所载，日月所照，霜露所队，凡有血气者，莫不尊亲。故曰配天。\n唯天下至诚，为能经纶天下之大经，立天下之大本，知天地之化育。夫焉有所倚！肫肫其仁，渊渊其渊，浩浩其天。苟不固聪明圣知达天德者，其孰能知之！\n诗曰：衣锦尚炯。恶其文之著也。故君子之道，黯然而日章；小人之道，的然而日亡。君子之道，淡而不厌，简而文，温而理，知远之近，知风之自，知微之显，可与入德矣。诗云：潜虽伏矣，亦孔之昭。故君子内省不疚，无恶于志。君子之所不可及者，其唯人之所不见乎！诗云：相在尔室，不愧屋漏。故君子不动而敬，不言而信。诗曰：奏假无言，时靡有争。是故君子不赏而民劝，不怒而民威于斧钺。诗曰：不显惟德，百辟其刑之。是故君子笃恭而天下平。诗云：子怀明德，不大声以色。子曰：声色之于化民，末也。诗曰：德遒如毛。毛犹有伦，上天之载，无声无臭，至矣！\n\n### 《论语》\n\n《论语》是记载孔子及其学生言行的一部书。孔子（前551年—前479年），名丘，字仲尼，春秋时鲁国陬邑（今山东曲阜）人。儒家学派创始人，中国古代最著名的思想家、政治家、教育家，对中国思想文化的发展有极其深远的影响。《论语》成书于春秋战国之际，是孔子的学生及其再传学生所记录整理。\n《论语》涉及哲学、政治、经济，教育、文艺等诸多方面，内容非常丰富，是儒学最主要的经典。在表达上，《论语》语言精炼而形象生动，是语录体散文的典范。在编排上，《论语》没有严格的编纂体例，每一条就是一章，集章为篇，篇、章之间并无紧密联系，只是大致归类，并有重复章节出现。到汉代时，有《鲁论语》（20篇）、《齐论语》（22篇）、《古文论语》（21篇）三种《论语》版本流传。\n东汉末年，郑玄以《鲁论语》为底本，参考《齐论语》和《古文论语》编校成一个新的本子，并加以注释。郑玄的注本流传后，《齐论语》和《古文论语》便逐渐亡佚了。以后各代注释《论语》的版本主要有：三国时魏国何晏《论语集解》，南北朝梁代皇侃《论语义疏》，宋代邢晏《论语注疏》、朱熹《论语集注》，清代刘宝楠《论语正义》等。宋代赵普有“半部论语治天下”之说，可见论语的贡献很大。\n\n### 《孟子》\n\n《孟子》是记载孟子及其学生言行的一部书。孟子（约前372-前289年），名轲，字子舆，战国中期邹国（今山东邹城东南人），离孔子的故乡曲阜不远。是著名的思想家、政治家、教育家，孔子学说的继承者。和孔子一样，孟子也曾带领学生游历魏、齐、宋、鲁、滕、薛等国，并一度担任过齐宣王的客卿。由于他的政治主张也与孔子的一样不被重用，所以便回到家乡聚徒讲学，与学生万章等人著书立说，“序《诗》《书》，述仲尼之意，作《孟子》七篇。”（《史记·孟子荀卿列传》）赵岐在《孟子题辞》中把《孟子》与《论语》相比，认为《孟子》是“拟圣而作”。所以，尽管《汉书·艺文志》仅仅把《孟子》放在诸子略中，视为子书，但实际上在汉代人的心目中已经把它看作辅助“经书”的“传”书了。\n汉文帝把《论语》、《孝经》、《孟子》、《尔雅》各置博士，便叫“传记博士”。到五代后蜀时，后蜀主孟昶命令人楷书十一经刻石，其中包括了《孟子》，这可能是《孟子》列入“经书”的开始。到南宋孝宗时，朱熹编《四书》列入了《孟子》，正式把《孟子》提到了非常高的地位。元、明以后又成为科举考试的内容，更是读书人的必读书了。\n两汉以后学五经，两宋以后学四书。半部论语打天下，半部论语治天下。\n\n## 五经\n\n《诗经》、《尚书》、《礼记》、《周易》、《春秋》，合称“五经”。五经是儒家作为研究基础的古代五本经典书籍的合称，相传它们都经过儒家创始人之一的孔子的编辑或修改。\n儒家本有六经，即《诗经》，《尚书》，《仪礼》，《乐经》，《春秋》，《周易》。秦始皇“焚书坑儒”，据说经秦火一炬，《乐经》从此失传，东汉在此基础上加上《论语》、《孝经》，共七经；到唐时，《春秋》分为“三传”，即《左传》、《公羊传》、《谷梁传》，《礼经》分为“三礼”，即《周礼》、《仪礼》、《礼记》，再增补《尔雅》构成十二经；宋时加《孟子》，后有宋刻《十三经注疏》传世。“十三经”是儒家文化的基本著作，就传统观念而言，《易》、《诗》、《书》、《礼》、《春秋》谓之“经”，《左传》、《公羊传》、《谷梁传》属于《春秋经》之“传”，《礼记》、《孝经》、《论语》、《孟子》均为“记”，《尔雅》则是汉代经师的训诂之作。后来的五经是指：《易经》、《尚书》、《诗经》、《礼记》、《左传》。\n\n### 《诗经》\n\n《诗经》是中国最早的一部诗歌总集，共收录周代诗歌305篇。原称“诗”或“诗三百”，汉代儒生始称《诗经》。现存的《诗经》是汉朝毛亨所传下来的，所以又叫“毛诗”。《诗经》是中国韵文的源头，是中国诗史的光辉起点。它形式多样：史诗、讽刺诗、叙事诗、恋歌、战歌、颂歌、节令歌以及劳动歌谣样样都有。它内容丰富，对周代社会生活的各个方面，如劳动与爱情、战争与徭役、压迫与反抗、风俗与婚姻、祭祖与宴会，甚至天象、 地貌、动物、植物等各个方面都有所反映。可以说，《诗经》是周代社会的一面镜子。而 《诗经》的语言是研究公元前11世纪到公元前6世纪汉语概貌的最重要的资料。\n据说《诗经》中的诗，当时都是能演唱的歌词。按所配乐曲的性质，可分成风、雅、颂类。“风”包括周南、召南、邶风、鄘风、卫风、王风、齐风、魏风、唐风、秦风、陈风、桧风、曹风、豳风组成，称为十五国风，大部分是黄河流域的民歌，小部分是贵族加工的作品，共160篇。“雅”包括小雅和大雅，共105篇。 “雅”基本上是贵族的作品，只有小雅的一部分来自民间。“颂”包括周颂、鲁颂和商颂，共40篇。颂是宫廷用于祭祀的歌词。一般来说，来自民间的歌谣，生动活泼，而宫廷贵族的诗作，相形见绌，诗味不多。\n《诗经》在先秦称《诗》，或《诗三百》，是中国第一本诗歌总集。汇集了从西周初年到春秋中期五百多年的诗歌三百零五篇（原三百十一篇），是西周初至春秋中期的诗歌总集。“古者《诗》三千余篇，及于孔子，去其重……”（《史记·孔子世家》），据传为孔子编定。《诗》分“风”、“雅”、“颂”三部分，“风”为土风歌谣，“雅”为西周王畿的正声雅乐，“颂”为上层社会宗庙祭祀的舞曲歌辞。《诗经》还有“赋”、“比”、“兴”这三个修辞手法。此书广泛地反映了当时社会生活各方面，被誉为古代社会的人生百科全书，对后世影响深远。喜欢诗词的朋友，相信都有读过。\n中国最早的诗歌总集。它收集了从西周初期至春秋中叶大约500年间的诗歌305篇。先秦称为《诗》，或取其整数称《诗三百》。西汉时被尊为儒家经典，始称《诗经》，并沿用至今。\n关于《诗经》的编集，汉代有两种说法：①行人采诗说。《汉书·艺文志》载：“古有采诗之官，王者所以观风俗，知得失，自考正也 。”《诗经》305 篇的韵部系统和用韵规律和诗歌形式基本上是一致的，而它包括的时间长、地域广，在古代交通不便、语言互异的情况下，如果不是经过有目的的采集和整理，要产生这样一部诗歌总集是不可想象的。因而采诗说是可信的。②孔子删诗说。《史记·孔子世家》载：“古者诗三千余篇，及至孔子去其重，取可施于礼义……三百五篇，孔子皆弦歌之。”唐代孔颖达、宋代朱熹、明代朱彝尊、清代魏源等对此说均持怀疑态度。《诗经》大约成书于公元前6世纪，此时孔子尚未出生；公元前544年吴公子季札至鲁国观乐，鲁乐工为他所奏的风诗次序与今本《诗经》基本相同，说明那时已有了一部《诗》，此时孔子年仅 8 岁 。 因此近代学者一般认为删诗说不可信 。 但根据《论语》中孔子所说：“吾自卫返鲁，然后乐正，雅、颂各得其所，”可知孔子确曾为《诗》正过乐。只不过至春秋后期新声兴起，古乐失传，《诗三百》便只有歌诗流传下来 ，成为今之所见的诗歌总集。\n《诗经》所录，均为曾经入乐的歌词。《诗经》的体例是按照音乐性质的不同来划分的 ，分为风 、 雅、颂三类。①风。是不同地区的地方音乐，多为民间的歌谣。《风》诗是从周南、召南、邶、鄘、卫、王、郑、齐、魏、唐、秦、陈、桧、曹、豳等15个地区采集上来的土风歌谣 。共160篇 。大部分是民歌 。②雅 。即朝廷之乐，是周王朝直辖地区的音乐 ，大部分为贵族的作品， 即所谓正声雅乐 。《雅》诗是宫廷宴享或朝会时的乐歌，按音乐的不同又分为《大雅》31篇，《小雅》74篇，共105篇 。除《小雅》中有少量民歌外。\n\n### 《尚书》\n\n《尚书》意为“上古之书”，是中国上古历史文件和部分追述古代事迹作品的汇编。记载上起传说中的尧舜时代，下至东周（春秋中期），约1500多年。基本内容是古代帝王的文告和君臣谈话内容的记录，这说明作者应是史官。《史记·孔子世家》称孔子“序《书传》，上纪唐虞之际，下至秦缪，编次其事”，相传为孔子编定。《尚书》有两种传本，一种是《今文尚书》，一种是《古文尚书》，现通行的《十三经注疏》本，是今文尚书和伪古文尚书的合编。古时称赞人“饱读诗书”，“诗书”便是分别指《诗经》、《尚书》。春秋战国时称《书》，到了汉代，才改称《尚书》。儒家尊之为经典，故又称《书经》。2008年7月，清华大学入藏了一批战国竹简，总数约2500枚。经专家鉴定，其内容全部都是古书，其中有许多经、史一类的文献。此次公布的清华简中，《傅说之命》三篇引发关注，其内容与东晋时期出现的伪古文《尚书》的《说命》篇完全不同，再次证明，传世的伪古文《尚书》系后人伪作。\n\n《尚书》据说原有一百篇，秦代焚书后（也可能是项羽火烧咸阳造成流失，亦或秦二世之后战乱流失。虽然始皇的法治与“诗书”中的“王道”治国有偏差，以始皇的明睿不可能做毁灭文化之暴举，咸阳应存有“诗书”的正本，所谓“焚书坑儒”不过是政治需要，雷声大雨点小。不能望文生义为“焚掉所有书籍，坑杀所有儒生”。历史有待验证，此处不可偏信偏听，特此注解），汉初仅搜集到二十九篇，用当时通行的隶书写定，称今文《尚书》。汉武帝时，从孔子故宅中发现用古文字写的《尚书》，比今文《尚书》多十六篇，称为古文《尚书》，这十六篇不久亡佚。晋人伪造古文《尚书》二十五篇，又从今文《尚书》中析出数篇，连同原有的今文 《尚书》共为五十八篇，也称古文《尚书》。《十三经注疏》中的《尚书》，就是经过晋人手术的这种古文《尚书》。\n《尚书》包括虞、夏、商、周书。《虞书》、《夏书》非虞夏时所作，是后世儒家根据古代传闻编写的假托之作。 《商书》是殷王朝史官所记的誓、命、训、诰，其中《汤誓》按时代说应为最早的作品，但这篇文章语言流畅，可能经过后人的润色。《盘庚》三篇古奥难读，较多地保留了原貌。《尚书》是中国古老的文章汇编。其中殷商和周初的部分，所用语言同秦汉时的古汉语已有很大不同，加以年代久远，传写讹误，十分艰涩难读。古代的另一种学术造假行为叫伪托。这类伪托之作和今日之学术造假不同，这类作者只求作品传世，既不求名也不求利。而且虽然是伪托之作，往往不乏学术价值，有些甚至是极其重要的文献。《禹贡》是中国现存最古史书《尚书》中的一篇。以前的学者都以为《禹贡》为夏朝史官甚至是大禹本人的著述，现在早已为学界所否定。上世纪30年代，顾颉刚提出了《禹贡》成书于战国时期的观点。其中最有意思的一个证据是：《禹贡》中提到一条河“菏”，菏指菏水，是公元前483年吴王夫差为与晋争霸而开凿的一条运河。即此一点就可以断定《禹贡》作于公元前483年之后。\n\n### 《周礼》\n\n《周礼》亦称《周官》或《周官经》，它是儒家的经典之一。儒家把《诗》、《书》、《礼》、《易》、《乐》、《春秋》作为六经。孔子收徒讲学时，选用了这些典籍作为教材。不过，孔子所讲授的礼、乐和旧的富有鬼神迷信色彩的礼、乐已有很大的区别。他认为，《乐》教，可以使人“广博易良”；《礼》教，可以使人“恭俭庄敬” （见《礼记·经解》）。孔子还说过：“不学礼，无以立。”（《论语·季氏》）在孔子看来，不学礼，便没有立足社会的依据。因此，必须“立于礼”（《论语·泰伯》）。\n《周礼》为何人所作，何时产物？历来也是有争论的。古文经学家认为，它是周公旦所作。今文经学家认为，它出于战国，也有人认为是西汉末刘歆所伪造。近人从周秦铜器铭文所载官制，参证该书中的政治、经济制度和学术思想，多数人认为是战国时的作品。也有人认为，《周礼》成于汉初。\n礼所包括的范围很广，从国家的典章制度，直至个人的行为准则。我们所能见到的礼书，有《周礼》、《仪礼》和《礼记》。《周礼》是讲周朝官制的，《仪礼》是讲各种典礼节仪的（如冠、婚、丧、祭等具体仪式），《礼记》是孔子学生以及后人传习《礼经》的记录，内容有关礼的性质、意义和作用。东汉学者郑玄分别给《仪礼》、《礼记》作了注解之后，才有了“三礼”这一名称。“三礼”都与孔子礼的思想有关，但只有《仪礼》（17篇）是由孔子整理编订的。 《周礼》是搜集周王室官制和战国时代各国制度，添附儒家政治理想，增减排比而成的汇编。由于中国早在夏、商、周时就进入了奴隶社会，而周为奴隶社会的鼎盛时代，所以《周礼》是中国最早和最完整的官制记录，也是世界古代一部最完整的官制记录。全书6篇，即《天官冢宰》、《地官司徒》、《春官宗伯》、《夏官司马》、《秋官司寇》、《冬官司空》，各篇分为上下卷，共12卷。这6篇中的《冬官司空》早佚，到汉时补以《考工记》。\n《周礼》一书，东汉郑玄撰有《周礼注》，唐朝贾公彦作《周礼正义》，清代孙诒让也撰有《周礼正义》，这些注释对后人研究《周礼》提供了参考资料。 周朝的最高统治者是周天子，他是奴隶主贵族的总代表。 辅助周王的大官，相传有太师、太傅和太保三公。成王时，周公为师，召公为保。“相王室以尹天下”。周公的儿子伯禽，也当过周王的师保。在令尊、令彝铭文中，周王命他“尹三事四方，受卿事寮”。“三事”是三种官职的总称，即政务官、事务官和地方官。“四方”是指四方诸侯和方国部落。“卿事寮”是指周朝政府中的大小官僚。 在周王及其师保之下，朝廷中最高的官职是卿士，即太宰、太宗、太史、太祝、太士、太卜，合称六卿。六卿经常在周王的左右。三左是太史、太祝、太卜；三右是太宰、太宗、太士。他们在朝廷中分立于周王的两侧，协助周王处理政务。 周王朝，“国之大事，在祀与戎”，所以六卿大多和宗教事务有密切的关系。太祝就是最大的祭祀官，周公儿子伯禽也曾任过太祝。太卜是管卜筮的，处于人神之间的媒介地位。 太士也是神职官吏。太史这一职位，就是商代以来的作册，周初毕公高曾任过太史，称为“作册毕公”。太宰可能是朝廷中的政务总管。太宗是管周朝的宗族和谱系，也是重要的职务。 六卿还有许多僚属，各有专职，所以总称为卿事寮。除六卿之外，周朝还设有五官：司徒、司马、司空、司土、司寇。\n《周礼》还包含着古代宗教、经济政策、哲学与伦理等诸多方面的历史资料，是一部以儒家思想为主，兼收法家和阴阳五行思想的重要文化典籍。\n\n### 《易经》\n\n《易经》在中国传统文化的经典著作中，被誉为诸经之首，三玄之一。《易经》包含《周易》，就是各种变化，孔子定为五经之一，计有24070字，分本经和大传两部分。本经包括八卦、重卦、卦辞、为易有主体，故称为经；大传包括上彖、下彖二、上象三、下象四、上系五、下系六、文言七、说卦八、序卦九、杂卦十，此十者合称十翼。十翼为阐明易经而作，故曰传，它是用八卦重叠而成的六十四卦为结构框架，把中华民族在太古时代摸索总结出来的生活经验和生产经验，用抽象的符号记录下来，进一步以阴阳变化之道来分析，说明宇宙间的一切现象，通过卜卦来启示天道，地道，人道的变化规律。\n《易经》是中国一部最古老而深邃的经典，是华夏五千年智慧与文化的结晶，被誉为“群经之首，大道之源”。在古代是帝王之学，政治家、军事家、商家的必修之术；它也是中医之子向更高层次学习的门槛。如果从本质上来讲，《易经》是一本“卜筮”之书。“卜筮”就是对未来事态的发展进行预测，而《易经》便是总结这些预测的规律理论的书。《周易》也称作是《易经》，被誉为是“群经之首，大道之源”。是中国古文化典籍中最古老而深邃的经典。\n\n### 《麟经》\n\n孔子所著《春秋》一书本名《麟经》，相传孔子编纂此书时，有一猎户背一奇形怪兽请教孔子所猎者为何物，孔子见状大惊曰：麒麟本是太平兽，缘何生来不逢时。自此便停著《春秋》，三年后孔子亡故。后人以此典故称孔子所著《春秋》为《麟经》，奉为四书五经之一。\n之所以以“春秋”一词命名史书，而非“冬夏”，是因五行学说中，“春秋”之位相应“东西”二方，东为木、西为金，金木为篆，故可标禀历史；金木为实，故可以史为鉴。有此缘故，故名“春秋”。而“冬夏”二季相应为“水火”，是阴阳变化之极，变化不定，故此不以此立说，亦不称物为“南北”也。\n《春秋》原是先秦时代各国史书的通称，后来仅有鲁国的《春秋》传世，便成为专称。这部原来由鲁国史官所编《春秋》，相传经过孔子整理、修订，赋予特殊的意义，因而也成为儒家重要的经典。 《春秋》是中国编年体史书之祖，它以鲁国十二公为序，起自鲁隐公元年（前722），迄于鲁哀公十四年（前481）记载了二百四十二年间的历史。它是纲目式的记载，文句极简短，几乎没有描写的成分。但它的语言表达，具有谨严精炼的特点，反映了文字技巧的进步。 《春秋》最突出的特点就是寓褒贬于记事的“春秋笔法”。相传孔子按照自己的观点对一些历史事件和人物作了评判，并选择他认为恰当的字眼来暗寓褒贬之意，因此《春秋》被后人看作是一部具有“微言大义”的经典，是定名分、制法度的范本。并且，在史书和文学作品的写作上，也对后人产生很大影响。史学家从中领悟到修史应该有严格而明确的倾向性，文学家往往体会了遣词造句力求简洁而义蕴深刻。当然，刻意求深，也难免造成文意晦涩的弊病。\n\n### 《礼记》\n\n《礼记》是战国到秦汉年间儒家学者解释说明经书《仪礼》的文章选集，“《礼记》只是解《仪礼》”（《朱子语类·卷八十七》），是一部儒家思想的资料汇编。《礼记》虽只是解说《仪礼》之书，但由于涉及面广，其影响乃超出了《周礼》、《仪礼》。《礼记》有两种传本，一种是戴德所编，有85篇，今存40篇，称《大戴礼记》；另一种，也便是我们所见的《礼记》，是戴德其侄戴圣选编的四十九篇，称《小戴礼记》。\n\n### 《春秋》\n\n《春秋》是鲁国的编年史，经过了孔子的修订。就因文字过于简质，后人不易理解，所以诠释之作相继出现,对书中的记载进行解释和说明，称之为“传”。其中左丘明《春秋左氏传》，公羊暠《春秋公羊传》，谷梁赤《春秋谷梁传》合称《春秋三传》列入儒家经典。\n《公羊传》与《谷梁传》是为解春秋之笔法，释《麟经》之精妙，但于《麟经》并无后续纪年。《左传》 也称《左氏春秋》、《春秋古文》、《春秋左氏传》，古代编年体历史著作。是孔子所著《麟经》之续，同为鲁国编年体史书，故与《麟经》并列。《史记》称作者为春秋时期左丘明，清代今文经学家认为系刘歆改编，近人又认为是战国初年人据各国史料编成（又有说是鲁国历代史官所写）。它的取材范围包括了王室档案，鲁史策书，诸侯国史等。记事基本以《春秋》鲁十二公为次序，内容包括诸侯国之间的聘问、会盟、征伐、婚丧、篡弑等，对后世史学文学都有重要影响。《左传》本不是儒家经典，但自从它立于学官，后来又附在《春秋》之后，就逐渐被儒者当成经典。\n\n### 《乐经》\n\n于战国时期失传。传说于秦始皇焚书坑儒之时被焚毁。\n\n## 考证\n\n2008年7月，清华大学入藏了一批战国竹简，总数约2500枚。经专家鉴定，其内容全部都是古书，其中有许多经、史一类的文献。此前，清华简第一辑和第二辑整理报告分别于2010年和2011年年底出版。此次公布的清华简中，《傅说之命》三篇引发关注，其内容与东晋时期出现的伪古文《尚书》的《说命》篇完全不同，再次证明，传世的伪古文《尚书》系后人伪作。古代的另一种学术造假行为叫伪托。这类伪托之作和今日之学术造假不同，这类作者只求作品传世，既不求名也不求利。而且虽然是伪托之作，往往不乏学术价值，有些甚至是极其重要的文献。\n《禹贡》是中国现存最古史书《尚书》中的一篇。以前的学者都以为《禹贡》为夏朝史官甚至是大禹本人的著述，现在早已为学界所否定。上世纪30年代，顾颉刚提出了《禹贡》成书于战国时期的观点。其中最有意思的一个证据是：《禹贡》中提到一条河“菏”，菏指菏水，是公元前483年吴王夫差为与晋争霸而开凿的一条运河。即此一点就可以断定《禹贡》作于公元前483年之后。此外，《周礼》 实际上成书于两汉之间，《庄子》 除内八篇外都是后人所作，《论语》的版本之争实际上就是真伪之辩。\n\n## 价值\n\n我们只要谈到中国传统文化，必然得提到“四书五经”。“四书五经”是中国传统文化的重要组成部分，是儒家思想的核心载体，更是中国历史文化古籍中的宝典。儒家经典“四书五经”包含内容极其广泛、深刻，它在世界文化史、思想史上具有极高的地位。\n“四书五经”详实地记载了中华民族思想文化发展史上最活跃时期的政治、军事、外交、文化等各方面的史实资料及影响中国文化几千年的孔孟重要哲学思想。历代科举选仕，试卷命题无他，必出自“四书五经”足见其对为官从政之道、为人处世之道的重要程度。\n四书五经在社会规范、人际交流，社会文化等产生不可估量的影响。时至今日，“四书五经”所载内容及哲学思想仍对我们现代人具有积极的意义和极强的参考价值。"],

"原本《春秋》是一本记事史书，记录了春秋时期的各诸侯国的政治、军事和社会等方面的事件。它的编者一般被认为是孔子。\n\n后来只有鲁国的《春秋》流传下来的原因有以下几点：\n\n1. 鲁国是孔子的故乡，他在那里进行了对《春秋》的加工编撰，这使得鲁国的《春秋》具有了特殊的地位和影响力。\n\n2. 鲁国自春秋时期起就形成了一种重视礼仪和典章制度的传统，这与《春秋》中所传承的价值观和道义观念相符合，因此鲁国的《春秋》更容易被当时的读者接受和传播。\n\n3.

A.J.Herketroter)先生，副主席约翰·吉宁斯(John Jennings)先生。\n壳牌集团共有11家服务公司承担着总部的管理和服务职能，主要任务是为集团的各业务公司和关联公司(指集团持股＜50%的公司)及其子公司(不包括美国壳牌石油股份有限公司及其子公司)提供咨询服务。\n这些服务公司既按业务划分，又按地区与职能进行划分，用矩阵式管理方法对全球业务进行组织管理。从功能来看，荷兰海牙的服务公司侧重技术性服务，英国伦敦的服务公司侧重商业性服务。为了便于地区协调，服务公司还按地区划分，设立了5个协调局，即亚太、西欧、独联体和东欧、西半球和非洲、远东和南亚。\n业务公司共有300余家，遍布世界100多个国家，经营范围包括石油、天然气、煤炭、化学品、金属及其它。每家业务公司均为独立组织，而其中很多是联营性质，并非完全由壳牌全资拥有，股东包括其它公司、政府或个别投资者。凡由壳牌集团持股51%以上的，称为集团公司，其余的称为关联公司。各业务公司的管理人员全权负责公司的经营业务和长期发展方针，并吸取服务公司的经验，通过他们获得其它业务公司的经验。 业务公司的五年计划和年度计划要征得服务公司的业务部门的意见后，和服务公司中的计划、财务、人事等部门协商，然后报区域协调局；区域协调局从区域资源和市场条件及集团能提供多少支持等方面进行研究协调，同意后才能上报集团董事局审批。壳牌公司集团在比利时、法国、德国、荷兰、英国、日本、新加坡、美国、加拿大等地设有12个科研和技术支持中心。集团各成员机构都坚持同一套商业操作、会计程序、安全及环境保护标准。集团的运作以\"经营总则\"所载的经营方针为基础。个别业务公司可因其所在地的情况，制定自己的嵌则，?quot;经营总则\"是壳牌集团成员经营操作的总指导方针，它概括了壳牌各公司的主要目标和责任。\n从上述组织机构看，壳牌公司集团过去的管理模式属综合型管理。最近，壳牌公司集团为了提高竞争能力，将按壳牌化学、壳牌炼油。勘探开采等专业业务划分成全球性营业公司，并把研究机构也并入各相应公司。如：壳牌化工公司负责经营管理壳牌公司全球化工业务，从1998年1月1日起也负责美国壳牌原有的化工业务。\n\n## 经营战略\n\n加强集团管理，建立业务组织\n为保证同一地区内各种业务间的协调，发挥备经营公司的主动性，1959年壳牌集团公司通过在海牙和伦敦开设服务公司，最高层成立“常务董事会”及通过地区监督在区域基础上协调各项业务等措施迈向了真正的集团管理，而不是将集团视为一家拥有很多分公司的机构。常务董事会的六位董事处于公司管理的最高阶层，管理着公司总体业务的拓展。他们每隔一周往返于伦敦和海牙之间，在绝对一致的基础上作出所有重大构想，重要计划与人事决定必须一致通过。这种体制为更好地进行集团管理起了很好的作用。如80年代使壳牌集团避免了象竞争对手那样盲目收购其它公司，经营耗资巨大而又不很熟悉的行业。\n70年代中期集团决定发展业务组织概念，以保证同一地区内各种业务间的协调，以一致的态度处理同政府及其它团体的往来。同时将集团的主要活动发展成独立的业务，要求各营业公司就各项业务为金融机构提供业绩报告。集团公司为每项业务制定发展策略，但允许营业公司保留日常决策权。1978年集团公司将地区组织职责进一步扩展至包括区内所有集团的业务，并提出了在个别国家设立壳牌专员的概念，壳牌专员协调并统筹该国的各项业务，直接向地区监督负责。同时，集团鼓励个人的主动性，在集团内部大约有260个重要经营公司被授予几乎完全的自主权，它们能对经营作出自己的决定，并有一系列服务公司通过科技服务作其后盾。这种分散化及自主权使经理们能更好地融入社会，并能对新规定、用户不断变化的需求及任何危机迅速作出反应。\n1996年初，壳牌公司集团对其运营结构进行了重组，以便更好地满足客户的需要以及商业挑战。各业务公司以当地客户为重，每家公司的管理层都对该公司的业绩及长期发展负贡。集团设立12个研究开发中心和11个服务公司，以支持业务公司的发展。\n全球性开发和优化配置资源及市场\n两次石油危机曾经给壳牌集团带来很大损失，针对全球石油供求关系不太稳定的情况，集团采取了把其业务进一步向世界各地扩展、实现资源和市场的全球化开发和优化配置的策略。壳牌集团在全球45个国家有勘探活动，在28个国家有石油生产，是全球上游活动最广泛的石油跨国公司。地理上的分散化使得某一地区的政治经济风波不会对集团的其它部分造成重大影响。一方面壳牌集团在全球各地大力勘探开发油气资源，增加投资，以保持并进一步提高其油气探明储量和产量及其分布地区的广泛性。1997年公司集团的勘探费用计划继续增加。另一方面，壳牌集团也把大力开发全球市场作为自己经营战略的又一重点。它通过建立和拥有庞大的油气运输船队及数以万计的加油站和零售点，在全球100多个国家建立了巨大的销售网络：在全球33个国家建有54座炼厂和一批石化生产基地及相关经营公司，建立了规模很大的全球生产、销售市场体系。在把握现有市场的同时，积极占领新的市场，打入东欧、拉美和亚太等地区，不断改善其在全球范围内的产销衔接和市场体系。\n保持对市场的高度反应能力，把握时机\n保持稳定发展壳牌集团十分注意提高其对国际市场的反应速度。对看准了的市场，不借投入巨资，以把握时机，获得最大利益。如1989年西班牙政府刚刚取消国家石油公司对国内加油站的垄断经营后，壳牌集团立即打入这一市场，在短短的2年内就在西班牙建立起了壳牌的加油站网。再比如针对欧洲炼油业的过度饱和，集团及时采取相应措施，一方面压缩其在该地区的炼油能力，另一方面在亚非拉地区新建和扩建了一批炼油装置和石化装置。针对近年来化工业获利能力持续下降的情况，集团在近年陆续出售了一些精细化工部门。为了应付突然发生的情况，壳牌集团在各地的经营公司还通过场景式预测定期进行石油中断\"或\"有变故\"的演习。由于这样的努力，使得该集团能够保持稳定发展，即使是海湾战争爆发时也做到了及时应变，没有遭受大的损失。\n以核心事业为主，进行多元化管理\n公司在美国的业务分布\n壳牌集团为了避免不必要的经营风险，注意将自己的多元化经营范围集中在与石油勘探开发、石油炼制、化工紧密\n相关或协同的煤炭、有色金属等行业，很少跨范围去经营自己不熟悉的行业。这种组合有助于避免季节间的波动，同时上游(石油勘探和开发)与下游(炼油与销售及相关化工产品)和相关的海运、煤炭等行业间取得了良好的平衡。在1992～1996年间，集团总资本支出中油气(石油勘探开发和炼油与销售)所占比例一直保持在75%～90%，保证了核心事业的发展；集团总销售收入中油气收入所占比例也一直保持在85%～90%的水平。同时集团十分注意加强石油炼制和化工的衔接和结合，在今后几年将对下游业务加大投资力度(计划今后5年投资47亿英镑)。该集团的煤炭、有色金属业也保持了稳定的发展，1996年煤炭销售量达到1850万吨，比上一年增加5%。\n加大科技投入，不断发展新技术\n不断开发新技术和新产品是壳牌取得成功的一个重要原因。为此壳牌集团在通过有关服务公司加强对全集团科技的集中统一管理和搞好对经营公司的科技咨询服务的同时，保证公司对科技的投入，1992～1996年间，公司集团用于科研和技术开发的投资始终保持在7亿美元以上。近几年来，集团的油气勘探越来越多在深海和极地等水深、高寒条件下进行，投资和环境风险大大升级，壳牌集团依靠自己开发的新技术减少了这方面的风险。同时，集团依靠开发新工艺、新技术、新产品，促进了配套石化、化工事业的迅速发展。此外集团还注意利用其雄厚的资本，通过与其它公司的合资经营，分享合资对方的技术和生产经验。该企业品牌在世界品牌实验室（World Brand Lab）编制的2006年度《世界品牌500强》排行榜中名列第七十四，在《巴伦周刊》公布的2006年度全球100家大公司受尊重度排行榜中名列第八十。\n\n## 业务范围\n\n壳牌通过大约25000家美国国内的品牌加油站成为市场领头羊，这些品牌加油站也是壳牌出现在美国公众面前的主力军。壳牌石油公司和沙特阿拉伯国有石油公司沙特Armoco各拥有莫蒂瓦企业公司一半股份，这个合资公司在美国墨西哥湾拥有并运营3个炼油厂。同时，它还拥有名叫Pecten的勘探公司的80%股份，该公司在各海上油田包括Douala, Cameroon和法国国有埃尔夫·阿奎坦公司 (道达尔石油公司)一起进行勘探和钻井业务。\n壳牌石油的产品除了石油的勘探，开发和炼化外，还包括各种油，燃料以及信用卡服务。位于加州Martinez的壳牌石油炼油厂是在美国的第一家炼油厂，供应了西部和中西部地区的壳牌和德士古的加油站。壳牌汽油过去包括RU2000和SU2000两条产品线（后来还曾有一个SU2000E产品线），不过它们都已经被V-Power产品线所取代。\n壳牌与雪佛龙签有协议，在一定区域内，当一个公司拥有炼油能力而另外一个没有的时候，则向对方供应基础汽油料(经过炼化但未添加V-Power或Techron等添加剂的汽油)。 2002年，壳牌开始更换德士古加油站为壳牌，预计这一美国商业史上最大的零售品牌重组过程将会在2004年6月完成。\"\n\n## 中国发展\n\n2000年，壳牌化工与中国海洋石油总公司合资的中海壳牌石油化工有限公司签署合营合同，这项总投资达41亿美元的合资项目是中国迄今为止最大的中外合资项目之一。该项目于2006年1月正式投产。壳牌与中国北京、天津、广东、成都建有加油站。\n\n##

与荷兰皇家壳牌的关系\n直到1980年代中期，壳牌在美国的业务基本上一直是独立的，其股票(“壳牌石油”) 在纽约证券交易所上市交易，而位于伦敦和海牙的集团总部办公室也有一些直接干预。1984年，壳牌通过竞拍购买了原不属于它所有的壳牌石油公司的股票（大约30%），此举引起了一些少数股东的反对，并导致了一场官司。尽管如此，壳牌还是成功地买下全部股权，价值约57亿美元。time=2009-05-19\n尽管进行了上述收购，然而壳牌石油还保留一项独立业务。这是由比较复杂的法律方面的原因造成的，因为荷兰皇家壳牌害怕承担一旦有因为母公司的过度控制造成的繁杂的责任问题。其中这一独立造成的奇怪结果是，壳牌的标志和在世界上其他国家的标志有一点儿不一样。1990年代，壳牌石油的独立性开始逐渐遭到破坏，因为母公司采取更直接的办法来运营业务。现在壳牌石油的标志与世界各地的一样。time=2009-05-19\n##

{"name": "M1卡宾枪", "documents": ["## M1卡宾枪\nM1卡宾枪（M1 Carbine）是美国在二战至越战时期采用的制式轻型半自动卡宾枪，有多种衍生型，是二战中美国使用最广泛的武器之一。\n## 历史\n1938年，美国陆军要求为军官、军士、车组成员、机枪手、通讯兵及其他不便携带全尺寸步枪的士兵，配备一种介乎于步枪与手枪之间，重量不超过2.5公斤的轻型步枪，作为轻型自卫武器用以取代手枪和冲锋枪。1940年美国军方批准展开研制计划，由温彻斯特连发武器公司设计的样枪以及弹药被美军选中，1941年定型，命名为M1卡宾枪，并于1942年进入现役装备部队。直到二战结束，M1卡宾枪共生产了超过600万把，这个数字超过了M1加兰德步枪的产量。二战期间，M1卡宾枪主要由美国海军陆战队使用。\n在太平洋战场，M1卡宾枪因体积小，重量轻，以及近距离火力较强而受到不经常与敌军直接作战的士兵或游击队员的好评。但日常与敌军作战的前线士兵（特别是在菲律宾作战的士兵）发现该枪的穿透力及停止作用均有所不足。虽然M1卡宾枪使用的.30卡宾枪弹可以轻松穿透钢盔以及当时日军所使用的护甲，但是敌军在中弹，以至多次中弹后仍未丧失战斗力的记录多次出现在美军各方的战后报告当中（after-action reports）。\n起初，M1卡宾枪被设计为一款具全自动射击功能的武器，但由于新型卡宾枪需要快速投产，该功能被取消了。然而在战争后期，为应对德军广泛采用的StG44突击步枪等全自动武器，美军于1944年10月采用可选射的改良版M2卡宾枪与30发弹匣。M2卡宾枪在全自动模式下射速高达850—900发／分钟。该枪在战争末期（1945年4月）才开始投产，美国军械署亦向士兵分发了可把M1改装成M2卡宾枪的转换套件，士兵可使用该工具在前线将M1卡宾枪改装以使其可全自动射击。这些改装型卡宾枪在二战末期的战斗中获美军有限使用。\n在韩战期间使用，美军内部出现很多抱怨指称.30卡宾枪弹无法阻止身着厚重衣物或装备的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军士兵，甚至在近距离以及多次命中的情况下亦不见效。海军陆战队第1师的陆战队员亦报告有卡宾枪弹无法阻止敌军士兵的情况，部份单位甚至对卡宾枪射手下达作战规定，要求其瞄准敌军头部射击。中国人民志愿军中使用美军装备的步兵也因相同的原因而厌恶该型卡宾枪，缴获的M1和M2卡宾枪一般装备传令员和迫击炮组员。尽管毁誉参半，M2卡宾枪仍因其持续性火力而常常成为美军在朝鲜半岛战场中夜间巡逻时的首选武器。士兵们经常会将两到三个弹匣用胶带固定在一起以提高换弹速度，即弹匣并联。（这一方式一般被称作“丛林风格”）\n越战期间，南越军队从美国政府接收了至少793,994把M1与M2卡宾枪，这些卡宾枪在战争中得到了广泛使用。与此同时，越共游击队也曾缴获这些卡宾枪，并将枪管或枪托锯短以方便使用。虽然M1／M2卡宾枪较轻的重量和较高的射速令其适合身材相对较小的亚洲人使用，但是也因为缺乏动能及穿透力而令这些武器无法与AK突击步枪作比较。\n## 设计\nM1／M2／M3卡宾枪采用短行程活塞导气原理，转拴式枪栓方式运作。其中M1和M3只能半自动射击，而M2则为一款选射武器，其枪栓左侧设有快慢机，可选择半自动或全自动射击。这些武器能够使用15或30发容量的弹匣供弹，枪托上可以附加携带两个备用弹匣的弹匣袋。\nM1／M2／M3卡宾枪所发射的.30卡宾枪弹（7.62×33毫米）基本上是Winchester Model 1905使用的.32 Winchester Self-Loading的无突缘版本。标准的.30卡宾枪弹弹头重110格令（7.1克），使用M1卡宾枪的18英寸枪管射击时，枪口初速度为610米／秒，动能为1,311焦耳。在yard的距离上，M1卡宾枪的散布在3英寸至5英寸之间，这对于一款近距离自卫武器来说已经足够。M1卡宾枪的最大射程为yd，但是弹头在超过yd后下坠严重，因此M1／M2／M3卡宾枪的实际有效射程大约为200码。\nM1卡宾枪最初服役时是使用15发标准直弹匣供弹。但随著美军于1944年10月采用M2卡宾枪，，一种30发弯曲弹匣（绰号“香蕉弹匣”）亦同时成为美军制式装备。二战后，30发弹匣很快成为了M1与M2卡宾枪的标准弹匣，但15发直弹匣一直到越战结束后才停止使用。在初期的战斗报告中，士兵们经常会在战斗中误将弹匣释放按钮当作保险按下。随后，生产厂商改以旋转式保险取代原本的按钮式保险。\n早期的M1卡宾枪并不配备刺刀，后来根据军队的要求，在枪管下方增加了刺刀座，并配备M4刺刀。M1／M2卡宾枪具有重量低及射击时容易控制等优点。在第二次世界大战期间，M1卡宾枪被认为是一种有效的近战武器。但在韩战期间，M1／M2卡宾枪在严寒低温环境下的可靠性表现差劣。主要原因是复进簧较为脆弱，润滑油在低温下冻结以及弹药在零度以下反冲力不足。\n## 出口\n越南战争初期，美国政府曾将M1／M2卡宾枪作为军事援助物资供应友邦，该枪曾是南越军队的主要武器。M1卡宾枪亦曾经是联邦德国（西德）巴伐利亚邦警察以及以色列警察使用的武器。直至现在，以色列仍拥有大量M1卡宾枪及.30卡宾枪弹药。\n## M1卡宾枪在中国\n1942年后美国以租借法案名义向中华民国政府供应有限的M1卡宾枪，相比起国民革命军当时装备的各款栓动式步枪，M1卡宾枪作为半自动武器而且轻巧灵活，故得到了不少国军士兵的好评。\n1945年，国民革命军宪兵也装备了M1卡宾枪，部份在国共内战期间流入中共军队手中。\n在韩战期间，入朝参战的中国人民志愿军也同样广泛地使用M1卡宾枪，这些武器不单来自原先的国民党军，也缴获自美军和韩国军，以及来自苏联转赠的二战期间美国对苏联的援助。\n1949年夏季，中共中央军委下令研究仿制M1卡宾枪，属下兵工厂并曾试产了少量枪枝。后因苏联提供兵工设备及技术（53式步骑枪及56式半自动步枪），中国人民解放军才停止研究仿制M1卡宾枪的工作。\n余下的M1卡宾枪被交予中国民兵使用至1980年代。\n## 改进型号\n### M2卡宾枪\n尽管美军对于该枪有需求，但M2卡宾枪在二战中的使用十分有限，且大多是用于战争即将结束时的太平洋战场。M2卡宾枪在后勤维护方面与M1卡宾枪并无太大差异，且其射程、精度以及穿透性均强于诸如汤普森冲锋枪与M3冲锋枪等使用手枪弹的冲锋枪。因此，在二战之后，M2卡宾枪在美军中很大程度上取代了冲锋枪，直到其被M16突击步枪取代。\n## 使用弹药类型\n军用.30卡宾枪弹：", "# M1卡宾枪\n\n美国研制的卡宾枪\n\nM1卡宾枪是美国陆军1940年左右要求研制的一种替代制式手枪的自卫武器。在二战期间，M1卡宾枪及其变形枪是一种相当有效的步兵近战武器。\n在战后一段时间内，有大量的M1卡宾枪及其变形枪作为军用剩余物资在民间市场上销售。## 由来介绍\n\nM1卡宾枪是美军在20世纪40年代设计制造的一种轻型半自动武器，其发射的.30卡宾枪弹威力远小于步枪弹，但又比手枪弹大的多。M1卡宾枪在第二次世界大战期间装备军士、基层军官以及二线作战部队，作为自卫武器使用，得到了广泛好评。\n\nM1卡宾枪的设计师大卫·威廉姆斯是一名很有才华的轻武器设计师，其曾因犯罪服刑，但却在监狱中设计出了一种新型步枪。后来威廉姆斯被释放，结合他在监狱中设计，仅仅用了13天便设计出了著名的M1卡宾枪。M1卡宾枪的重量非常轻，后坐力很小，不需要什么训练就能轻易掌握，射程和精度都远远超过手枪，非常适合作为近距离的自卫武器。由于其威力和精度都大于冲锋枪，因此也被作为近战武器使用。在朝鲜战争中，部分美军士兵认为M1卡宾枪威力不足，甚至无法打穿棉衣。但事实上，这是由于目标超出了武器有效射程导致的。作为近距离作战武器，M1卡宾枪还是相当优秀的。\n美国陆军的这个要求被搁置了一段时间，然后在1940年重新提出。美国陆军军械部提出的具体战术技术指标要求是：质量小于2.5kg，能实施单发或连发发射，能取代手枪和冲锋枪作为军士、基层军官或机枪手、炮手、通信兵或二线人员使用的基本武器。1940年6月15日，美国国防部部长正式批准了轻型自卫武器的研制工作，11月中旬，美国陆军委托温彻斯特公司研制威力介于步枪弹和手枪弹之间的新型枪弹。新枪的研制则在温彻斯特公司、柯尔特公司、史密斯-韦森公司等在内共有11家公司中产生。\n负责弹药开发工作的温彻斯特公司当时正忙于调整M1伽兰德步枪的生产线，因此在1941年5月进行的第一次对比试验中未能及时提交自己的产品。经过5月份的初步射击试验后，美国陆军放弃了连发发射的要求。到9月份第二次对比试验前，温彻斯特公司提交了他们的半自动轻型步枪。1941年9月30日，选型委员会的报告书认为温彻斯特公司的样枪最适合。该设计方案于1941年10月正式定型，并命名为“M1 0.30英寸（7.62mm）卡宾枪”，并初步装备给陆军试用。\nM1卡宾枪\n于1942年6月交货，由于交付数量已经满足要求，因此除了通用汽车公司内陆制造分公司和温彻斯特公司外，其他承包商的生产合同在1944年中期被取消，而这两家公司也在1945年8月停止了卡宾枪的生产。在这38个月内，一共生产了 600多万支卡宾枪，包括原型M1卡宾枪和M1A1、M2、M3等变型枪。内陆制造公司的产量最大，占总数的43%，而温彻斯特公司的产量只占13.5%，其他公司都不超过10%。\n与几种变型枪相比，原型M1卡宾枪产量最大，共生产了551万支。与M1伽兰德步枪相比，M1卡宾枪有便于更换的弹匣和较大的容弹量，实际射速高而且后坐力低，其射击精度和侵彻作用比使用手枪弹的冲锋枪强。增加快慢机和大容量弹匣的M2火力“几乎”相当于突击步枪（之所以用“几乎”是因为其有效射程还是太近了）。因此在二战期间M1卡宾枪及其变型枪是一种相当有效的步兵近战武器。然而，虽然这种武器威力低、射程近、可靠性不高，但它在第二次世界大战中却表现极佳，在欧洲战场这种武器和其改进型M1A1卡宾枪大量装备给士官、侦察兵和空降部队。而在太平洋战场几乎遍地都是，几乎完全取代了M1加兰德步枪。朝鲜战争和越南战争的初期阶段，M1卡宾枪和它的变型枪仍是被用于一线战斗的武器，但在朝鲜战争期间，M1卡宾枪由于在低温条件下的可靠性差而名誉扫地，而且据说甚至不能有效射穿厚棉衣。不过在越南战争初期，又轻又短的M1卡宾枪又成了一种非常有用的丛林战步枪而受到欢迎，直到M16A1的出现。M1卡宾枪也被美国政府大量输出到其他友好地区（大部分在东南亚，例如南越政府军）。M1卡宾枪在战后的西德和法国也有少量使用，而作为治安部队的武器，巴伐利亚的乡村警察使用得最多，以色列警察仍在大量地使用M1卡宾枪。\n\n## 设计师\n\n卡宾枪的开发小组由温彻斯特研究所所长爱德温·巴格丝雷领导，他从公司外请来了北卡罗来纳州的大卫·马绍尔·威廉姆斯，此人曾一度被认为是13天内设计了卡宾枪的天才设计师，更被人称为 “卡宾威廉姆斯”。\n威廉姆斯在1921年因为私自酿酒（当时美国正在禁酒）而被捕，逮捕过程中一名县警中枪身亡，法庭在证据不足的情况下把威廉姆斯关进监狱。当时典狱官并不相信威廉姆斯有罪，而且还认为他有轻武器设计方面的才能，因此允许威廉姆斯在监狱的工作室里利用废弃钢材设计步枪，而且还在监狱内试射成功。典狱官与天才犯人之间的友谊经过媒体报道而轰动了北卡罗来纳州，法庭重新审理了威廉姆斯的案件，终于查清是另一名县警开枪时误击同伴。威廉姆斯在服完非法酿酒的刑期后于1929年出狱，并继续进行枪械设计的工作。传奇性的故事总是令人津津乐道，所以经过新闻媒体渲染后许多人都以为M1卡宾枪是威廉姆斯设计的，但事实上M1卡宾枪的原型是温彻斯特研究所以前设计过的一种猎用卡宾枪的方案，该方案原本已经被弃用，由于时间紧迫而重新拿了出来，并采用了威廉姆斯在狱中所设计的短行程活塞导气系统。\n\n## 结构特点\n\nM1卡宾枪所使用的0.30英寸M1卡宾枪普通弹是由温彻斯特公司在0.32英寸（7.65mm）步枪弹的基础上，将其外部尺寸略加修改而成的。M1卡宾枪弹采用直筒形无突缘弹壳，圆弧形弹头，弹头质量7.1g，枪口初速为570m/s。枪口动能大约相当于0.45ACP手枪弹的2倍，但只有0.30-06步枪弹的1/3,口径7.62\\*33mm（与AK47步枪口径相同。）。按叫法，M1卡宾枪弹可算得上是“中间威力”步枪弹，但枪口动能太小且弹头形状欠佳，因此其有效射程只有大约200m左右。但无论如何，它的射程还是比手枪弹远得多，而且后坐力适中。除了M1普通弹外，还可使用M16和M27两种曳光弹及M6空包弹。\n\nM1卡宾枪采用短行程活塞的导气自动原理，由大卫·威廉姆斯设计。导气孔位于枪管中部，距弹膛前端面115mm，活塞在枪管下方，后坐距离仅3.5mm。发射时，火药燃气通过导气孔进入导气室并推动活塞向后运动，活塞撞击枪机框，使之后坐。枪机框后坐约8mm后，膛压下降至安全值，这段时间为开锁前的机械保险。然后，枪机框导槽的曲线段与枪机导向凸起相扣合，枪机开始旋转（同时起预抽壳的作用）开锁。在枪机后坐过程中，其上的抽壳钩拉着弹壳向后运动，弹壳被拉出弹膛后，由枪机上的弹性抛壳挺向右前方抛出。\n当枪机框惯性体后端撞击机匣时，枪机框停止后坐，而枪机则要到它碰及机匣中枪机通孔的后端才停止运动。此时枪机后坐行程大于全弹长，于是弹匣中最上面的一发弹又被托弹板送至进弹位置。然后被压缩的复进簧伸张，推枪机复进，同时推弹入膛。由于枪机上的导向凸起和枪机框导槽的相互作用，枪机回转，实现闭锁。然后枪机框继续复进，直至惯性体的前端将活塞顶入活塞筒才完全停止。此时，枪再次呈待击状态。事实上，M1卡宾枪的枪机和M1伽兰德步枪的基本上一样，只不过是尺寸按比例缩小了而已。\n当击针向前运动时，其尾端的凸起必须进入机匣横梁上的槽中，否则，击针就无法向前。而这一点只有在枪机旋转到位并确实闭锁后才能实现。如果在枪机未确实闭锁的情况下扣压扳机，击锤也会向前转动，不过其能量却消耗在使枪机旋转进入闭锁位置，故无足够的能量打击击针击发枪弹，可避免意外事故的发生。\n扳机护圈前面的手动保险是直推式的。把它推向左边时，保险机销轴上的平面对准扳机前端，因此允许扳机前端下落，从而可使扳机后端的凸肩上抬。当把保险推向右边时，保险机销轴的圆柱面移至扳机前端的下方，阻止扳机向下运动，形成保险。\n早期M1卡宾枪上的保险是横推式的开关，但后来改成回转式的杠杆开关，这是因为在持续射击时保险按钮很快会变得过热，弹匣扣紧邻着保险按钮，而发烫的保险按钮会影响更换弹匣。\nM2卡宾枪还可以实施连发发射。当枪机框复进到位时，撞击连发杆，连发杆抬起阻铁，解脱击锤，枪即连续发射。M2 卡宾枪的快慢机选择杆装在机匣左侧。\n早期M1卡宾枪采用翻转式L形表尺，照门的大觇孔射程设定在150码（137m），小觇孔为300码（274m）。后来的M1和M2卡宾枪都把表尺改为滑动式，距离从 100m至300m内可调，而且也可以调整风偏。\n早期的M1卡宾枪上并不能配刺刀，后来根据部队提出的要求，在1943年10 月开始试验M1卡宾枪的刺刀，最后在1944年5月选定了T8试制型刺刀，并正式命名为M4刺刀，同时在枪管下方增加了方形的刺刀座。\nM1卡宾枪配有草绿色的帆布枪带，在枪托上可以附加两个弹匣袋，以便在枪身上携带两个备用弹匣。M1和M2卡宾枪均可安装M8型枪榴弹发射插座发射枪榴弹。\n\n## 改进型号\n\n### M1A1卡宾枪\n\n1942年定型，共制造约150000把，折叠枪托，金属制骨架式枪托，向左折叠，供空降部队使用。\n\nM1卡宾枪与M1A1卡宾枪\n\n### M1A2卡宾枪\n\n改进机械照门，加入风偏调节；没有投产。\n\n### M1A3卡宾枪\n\n由M1A1用的折叠枪托改为伸缩式枪托，配备15发弹匣；没有投产，原意为替代M1A1卡宾枪但没有落实。\n\n### M2卡宾枪\n\n1944年定型，增加快慢机，可选择单发、连发射击模式；配30发弹匣，但可与15发弹匣通用；共制造约60000把（因为有众多M1卡宾枪被改造成M2，所以实际数目比官方公布为多）。虽然有连射模式，但因为无手枪式握把，比有握把的突击步枪较难控制。\n1942年初，美国陆军的空降部队要求开发一种能折叠枪托以缩短全枪长度，且在折叠状态下也能射击的M1卡宾枪。1942年3月通用汽车公司试制了侧向折叠的金属骨架形枪托样枪，而斯普林菲尔德兵工厂则试制了伸缩式金属枪托样枪。经过试验，通用汽车公司的样枪在1942年5月被选定为制式武器，正式命名在研究卡宾枪的最初要求中，原本是要有连发发射功能的，但是这个要求在通过初步试验后被放弃。但后来基于士兵的反馈，又提出要求有连发发射功能，于是在1944年5月开始研制增加了快慢机的M1卡宾枪，研制工作由通用汽车公司和斯普林菲尔德兵工厂分别进行，最后通用汽车公司研制的样枪被采用，在1944年9 月正式命名为M2卡宾枪。由于连发发射时弹药消耗特别快，因此将弹匣容量增加到30发，但可与原来的15发弹匣通用。M2卡宾枪仅生产了57万支，主要装备给参谋士官或军官使用。\n\n### M3卡宾枪\n\n1945年定型，装有主动红外夜视装置，以T3镜架配合；加装喇叭形枪口消焰器。服役于第二次世界大战、朝鲜战争及越战，共制造约3000把。\nM3卡宾枪在研制时被称为T3式卡宾枪或T120式卡宾枪，是在1944年初应美国陆军的要求而开发的一种夜间近战用武器。T3卡宾枪基本上就是在M2卡宾枪的机匣上安装了主动红外夜视瞄准装置，前护木下安装了一个带控制开关的握把。由于主要是在夜间使用，又在枪口上加装了喇叭形高效消焰器，以减少射击时被敌人发现的机会，另外取消了连发发射功能。首次出现，在公众视野是在1945年美军进驻冲绳，之前为保密状态。T3卡宾枪在1945年8月被正式命名为M3卡宾枪，生产数量约3000把。其后，在朝战中进一步改进了M3式瞄准镜，将夜间使用有效范围扩展到100米。中国人民志愿军在战役中多有缴获\n。\n\n##

八八舰队\n1905年5月27日，在日俄战争中，东乡平八郎率日本海军联合舰队歼灭了俄罗斯帝国海军由波罗的海舰队拼凑而成的第二太平洋舰队，一举确立了日本“海军强国”的地位。从此，大舰巨炮便成了海军的传统，日本海军在日俄战争之前的六六舰队基础上规划的八八舰队便随之出笼，是以八艘战列舰和八艘装甲巡洋舰组成，是日本海军以主力军舰为核心的海军扩充计划，其宗旨是组成强大的海军力量与敌对决。\n##概要\n1907年（明治40年）、因日本帝国国防方针于当年年度初期决定「国防所要兵力」而确立。\n第一次世界大战结束后，因1921年华盛顿海军条约起草，要求军备限制，而胎死腹中。\n## 六六舰队和最初的八八舰队方案\n中日甲午战争结束后，由于三国干涉还辽事件，日本自签订马关条约后开始了为期10年的“卧薪尝胆”阶段，针对远东的俄、法、德海军力量进行扩张，主要假想敌为俄国太平洋分舰队。经过1895年和1896年的两次增调，俄国太平洋舰队的实力为战列舰1艘、一级巡洋舰7艘、二级巡洋舰3艘、鱼雷巡洋舰2艘、炮舰6艘、雷击舰7艘、鱼雷艇3艘，总计13.4万吨，再加上法德两国的远东舰队，总吨位达21万吨。而当时的日本海军主力战舰仅有“三景舰”松岛、严岛、桥立和镇远号铁甲舰，总吨位不过9万吨，与三国相比居于劣势。为了扭转这一局面，海军舰政局长佐双左仲在1896年提出了后来被称为“六六舰队”方案的《海军发展10年规划》，即以海军建设费新购6艘战列舰和6艘装甲巡洋舰，以此为核心，使日本海军的主力舰吨位达到13万吨，再加上辅助舰艇，日本海军的实力将超过远东地区其他国家海军力量的总和。此时日本已经有两艘新订造的战列舰从英国抵达日本，即“富士”号和“八岛”号，如果要完成“六六舰队”的构想，日本还需要再采购4艘战列舰、6艘装甲巡洋舰。\n“六六舰队”的海军扩建费被均摊到两年的预算支出中，分别以“第一期海军扩张费”（1896年）和“第二期海军扩张费”（1897年）的名义得到日本国会的批准，其总额为2.13亿日元，其中1.395亿日元造舰费来自甲午战争后的中国赔款，其余部分包括对清军备扩张时代海军扩张费用的延续（已订购的富士、八岛等舰，以及“水雷战舰艇发展基金”）和1905年后增加的若干笔小额补充拨款。除了12艘主力舰外，“六六舰队”计划还包括10艘轻巡洋舰、37艘雷击舰及鱼雷艇和众多辅助舰艇，整个计划中新建和外购的军舰达103艘，合计排水量达153,000吨。\n由于八岛号战列舰和初濑号战列舰在日俄战争中触雷沉没，因此日本国会以“舰艇补足费”的名义紧急向海军省划拨了一笔造舰资金，用于建造2艘战列舰和4艘装甲巡洋舰。由于战时无法从国外购买军舰，因此这六艘新舰的设计和建造工作完全由日本独立进行，建造代号以天干、地支命名，即“甲号战舰”（安艺）、“乙号战舰”（萨摩）、“子号装甲巡洋舰”（筑波）、“丑号装甲巡洋舰”（生驹）和“寅号装甲巡洋舰”（鞍马）。“卯号装甲巡洋舰”没有建造，其预算被延用于建造比叡号战列巡洋舰。\n日俄战争结束后，日本对其远东假想敌的次序作了一次调整。明治40年（1907年）的国防方针规定，日本的头号假想敌仍为俄国，其次则是美国。该方针规定日本的陆军平时应保持25个师团的规模，战时则应能够迅速扩充到50个师团。海军最低限度应以舰龄不满8年的8艘战列舰和8艘装甲巡洋舰为核心，此即“八八舰队”概念的发端。\n除了六六舰队外，日本在日俄战争前后还购买或俘获了6艘战列舰和3艘装甲巡洋舰，至1905年，其舰队主力舰规模已达10艘战列舰（不含日俄战争中损失的2艘）及9艘装甲巡洋舰。然而由于英国无畏号战列舰的服役，海军主力舰设计进入了新的阶段，旧式战列舰变得过时。1906年9月28日，日本海军大臣斋藤实向首相西园寺公望提出了日俄战争后的“海军整备计划”，作为申请今后10年造舰拨款的依据。按照斋藤的规划，在1910年之前，海军的首要扩充目标是建造2万吨级战列舰3艘，1.8万吨级装甲巡洋舰4艘，4500吨级二等巡洋舰3艘，900吨级大型驱逐舰6艘，400吨级驱逐舰24艘，以及潜艇6艘。\n1906年12月，“海军整备计划”在第23届帝国议会提出，并获得通过。这届议会批准的海军造舰拨款分为两部分：“补充舰艇费”7658万日元，平均分为7年拨付，用于建造战列舰“河内”、“摄津”、一等巡洋舰“金刚”、二等巡洋舰“筑摩”、“矢矧”、“平户”，驱逐舰“海风”及“波-9”、“波-10”号潜艇；“舰艇补足费”6408万日元，分4年付清，用于完成战列舰“萨摩”、“安艺”和一等巡洋舰“筑波”、“生驹”、“鞍马”的建造工作，并新建一等巡洋舰“比睿”、二等巡洋舰“利根”、驱逐舰“山风”、“神风”、通报舰“淀”、“最上”和1至13号潜艇。此外还拨付“整备费”1亿1092万日元，用于战利舰的修复和军港建设，海军教育机构的扩展；“军舰建造及建设费”9986万日元，用于完成“香取”、“鹿岛”、“扶桑”、“伊吹”、“榛名”、“雾岛”等舰的建造。\n1909年，英国开工建造搭载343毫米主炮的“猎户座”级战列舰和“狮”级战列巡洋舰，宣告了“超无畏舰时代”的来临。日本海军也修改了造舰计划。由于1907年海军规划中计划建造的4艘装甲巡洋舰此时尚未开工，日本海军决定修改设计、加大舰体和主炮，将其建造为日本首级“超无畏舰”，即金刚级战列巡洋舰。\n## 八八舰队（1920年）\n### 八四舰队案\n1914年7月10日，海军大臣八代六郎向防务会议提交了“八八舰队案”第二阶段整备提要，即“八四舰队案”大纲，内中声称考虑到日本当前的财政现状，海军先以装备舰龄未满8年的战列舰8艘、战列巡洋舰4艘为扩充目标。同年10月3日，海军将“八四舰队案”的具体对策以“海军舰艇补充方针”的形式提交防务会议讨论。10月7日，防务会议以“在国力允许的限度内（建造军舰）”为前提批准了该案。\n“海军舰艇补充方针”内容大致包括以下几点：一、将建造中的3艘战列舰（山城、伊势、日向）、6艘驱逐舰和2艘潜艇的补足建造费全部拨付到位；二、由于造舰技术日新月异，为了避免出现战斗力落后的情况，战列舰、战列巡洋舰、巡洋舰、炮舰等军舰以8年为一期，以服役满3期（24年）为最高舰龄；驱逐舰、潜艇和鱼雷艇以满2期（16年）为最高舰龄，军舰超过这一舰龄就必须退役，以新军舰代之；三、舰龄从竣工之日起计算；四、因战斗、事故等原因导致舰龄缩短的战舰，其服役年限可以相应缩短；五、根据本方针，需要补充的舰艇包括战列舰和战列巡洋舰12艘、巡洋舰16艘、驱逐舰和潜艇56艘。\n当防务会议把“舰艇补充方针”提交给第35届国会讨论时再度引起纷争，一部分国会议员提出，国会刚刚否决了陆军提出的计划用于朝鲜防备的两个师的增师预算，却要批准海军的扩充案，未免说不过去。因已到年底，国会解散在即，不如将该案留给次年选举后的新国会解决。这样，日本海军申请增加预算的请求再次在国会搁浅，而此时第一次世界大战已经爆发，日本海军向青岛和德占太平洋岛屿出兵、向欧洲派出远征舰队，以及建造急需的16艘驱逐舰，都需要经费，这些钱最后以从临时军事费中划拨的形式得到解决。\n1915年9月10日，海军大臣加藤友三郎向防务会议提出了上一年胎死腹中的“八四舰队案”，该案自大正五年（1916）开始、大正十二年（1923）结束，为期8年。其中，大正五年开工建造8艘舰艇，总预算4532万7819日元，同时筹建3个航空队，航空预算为63万日元；大正六年开工建造63艘舰艇，总预算2亿6152万2160日元。根据这个修改过的“八四舰队案”，该案完成后，日本海军将拥有8艘舰龄不满8年的一线战列舰，包括正在建造中的扶桑、山城、伊势、日向，以及分别在大正五年、六年、七年、九年（1916-1920）开工的长门、陆奥、加贺、土佐四艘战列舰。4艘新战列巡洋舰则为刚竣工的榛名、雾岛，以及分别在大正十年、十一年时达到8年舰龄的金刚、比睿二舰的代舰。这一批造舰计划之所以到大正十二年为止，是因为该年之后扶桑、山城、伊势、日向四舰都将陆续达到8年舰龄，转入二线，需要建造替换舰。\n加上巡洋舰等辅助舰艇的建造费，“八四舰队案”需要的总经费为3亿6429万日元，其中头四年每年拨付4532万日元，同时，在大正五年（1916年）开工的战列舰长门和巡洋舰天龙、龙田的后续建造费588万日元需要立即得到批准。1915年年底，防务会议向第36届国会提出的就是这样一份申请。国会对此提出了几点质询意见：一、这个计划比明治四十年（1907）的“八八舰队案”少了4艘主力舰，需要的造舰费却大幅度增加；二、与战舰相比，辅助舰艇的数目是否过少？三、考虑到最近欧洲海战的结果，是否要作出舰型上的变化？加藤友三郎对国会提出的疑问一一答复：大正四年时代的战舰建造技术比明治四十年时有很大进步，单舰建造费上涨；辅助舰艇数目如何视战术上的需要而定，与主力舰之间没有一定的固定比例搭配；如果需要根据欧洲海战的结果做出战舰设计和技术上的变更，所需的经费将在已经拨付的预算中解决，不再提出另外的拨款要求。在这样的保证下，1916年2月，日本第36届国会最终批准了“八四舰队”建造案。\n八四舰队案造舰计划（大正五年度造舰计划）：\n八四舰队案造舰计划（大正六年度造舰计划）：\n### 八六舰队案\n1915年制订的“八四舰队计划”预计到1923年装备舰龄未满8年的八艘战列舰和四艘战列巡洋舰。包括已经建成的以及接近完工的战列舰扶桑级2艘、伊势级2艘，战列巡洋舰金刚级4艘。计划拨款建造战列舰长门、陆奥（长门级）、加贺、土佐（加贺级），以及战列巡洋舰天城、赤城（天城级），2艘天城级是该计划执行期间届时舰龄即将满8年的2艘金刚级的替代舰。1918年扩充为“八六舰队计划”，计划拨款建造战列巡洋舰爱宕、高雄（天城级）。为实现该计划，日本海军提出将预定于大正十二年（1923）竣工的陆奥等舰经费余额全部一次性拨付到位的要求。1917年1月，第37届国会因对寺内正毅内阁提出不信任案而解散，当年6月的临时国会批准了2亿6152万日元的预算要求。\n1917年日本国会核准年度预算的时候，日本海军又提出了新的要求：根据前一年英德日德兰海战的结果，战列巡洋舰这一舰种被证明具有很大的价值，因此提出在1918年预算中增加2艘战列巡洋舰（榛名、雾岛代舰）的建造预算计64,814,128日元；根据海战结果，“比较能够发挥打击威力”的轻巡洋舰和驱逐舰也要多建造几艘，因此应该再加上长良、名取、五十铃等3艘轻巡洋舰、此外还有27艘驱逐舰、48艘潜艇和6艘特务舰的建造费183,948,155日元，以上“新舰建造费”合计为248,762,283日元。“考虑到顺应世界大势，海军军舰的战斗能力不能逊色于外国海军”，因此还要加上对已经开工的舰艇进行改建的“舰船改良费”42,796,701日元。此外再考虑日本参战以来物价腾贵的因素，再加上“物价差额”8,989,453日元。以上预算合计为3亿零54万8437日元。其时间跨度从大正七年（1918年）延续到大正十二年（1923年），预期在六年内完成。这就是作为八八舰队计划第二阶段的“八六舰队”案。\n八六舰队案计划新建舰艇86艘，此外还通过了585万日元的航空队整备追加预算，计划在八四舰队案组建的3个航空队之外再装备5个航空队，达到8个航空队的总数。\n到1917年通过“八六舰队”案时为止，日本海军现有的舰龄不满8年的主力舰有11艘，包括“超弩级”的战列舰扶桑号和4艘金刚级战列巡洋舰，以及半无畏级的战列舰萨摩、安艺、河内（次年7月即自爆沉没）、摄津，大型巡洋舰鞍马、伊吹。舰龄超过8年的有大型巡洋舰生驹（筑波号已于1917年1月14日自爆沉没）、战列舰香取、鹿岛、三笠、肥前、朝日、敷岛。正在建造中的有战列舰山城、伊势、日向。根据“八四舰队”和后续的“八六舰队”两案准备开工建造的新主力舰包括战列舰4艘、战列巡洋舰4艘。\n八六舰队案造舰计划（大正七年度造舰计划）：\n### 八八舰队案\n日本海军到1920年形成最终的“八八舰队计划”，到计划完成时的1927年，届时扶桑级、伊势级、金刚级的舰龄将满8年，该计划在战列舰长门级2艘、加贺级2艘，战列巡洋舰天城级4艘的基础上，再拨款建造4艘战列舰，4艘战列巡洋舰。最终的八八舰队计划舰：1号舰长门（服役）、2号舰陆奥（服役）、3号舰加贺（接替天城改建成航空母舰）、4号舰土佐（终止）、5号舰天城（计划改建成航空母舰，在大地震中损坏后拆毁）、6号舰赤城（改建成航空母舰）、7号舰爱宕（终止）、8号舰高雄（终止）、9号舰纪伊、10号舰尾张、11号舰（骏河？）、12号舰（近江？）、13号舰～16号舰未命名。八八舰队计划除主力舰的建造计划以外，还包括巡洋舰、驱逐舰、潜艇、特务舰和海军航空队的建造和组建计划。\n1919年6月，日本海军向防务会议提出了新的预算拨款要求：从大正十二年到大正十五年（1923-1926年），扶桑级和伊势级这两级战列舰将满8年舰龄，变为二线战舰，金刚级战列巡洋舰也满8年舰龄；到大正十六年（1927，实际上日本在1926年就改元昭和了），不满8年舰龄的只有搭载16英寸舰炮的长门级2艘、加贺级2艘和天城级4艘.因此从1920年到1927年这7年的时间里，需要再增建4艘4.1万吨级的战列舰（纪伊、尾张、11号舰、12号舰）和4艘4.1万吨级战列巡洋舰，这样才能实现巩固日本帝国海上安全的目标。\n除了主力舰的更新外，“八八舰队”案还准备建造2艘12500吨的翔鹤级航空母舰（航母凤翔号的扩大改型，并非二战当中的翔鹤级），4艘8000吨级的重型巡洋舰，8艘5500吨级轻型巡洋舰，22艘1350吨级一等驱逐舰，10艘850吨级二等驱逐舰，28艘1000吨级大型潜艇，用于中国方面警备的1艘1000吨级航洋炮舰和4艘300吨级内河炮舰，2艘14500吨级的水雷母舰（鱼雷艇母舰），1艘3000吨级敷设舰（布雷舰），6艘7500吨级给油舰，6艘700吨级扫海舰（扫雷舰）。此外，海军航空兵由“八六舰队”案规划的8个航空队扩充至17队，其中15队为战斗队，2队为训练队。\n根据日本海军的估算，长门级战列舰单舰造价为2692万日元，天城级战列巡洋舰单舰造价为2469万日元。考虑到海军技术的更新，以及物价上涨的因素，新建8艘主力舰单舰造价肯定要提高。按照海军舰政本部和造船厂的估算，纪伊型战列舰单舰造价为3645万日元（实际上在日本海军提交给国会的预算报表里，纪伊级的估算造价比这个要高），第八号型战列舰的造价为3742万日元，相当于同时期建造的峰风型驱逐舰单价的17倍。再加上新建12艘轻巡洋舰、32艘驱逐舰、以及其他辅助舰艇如潜艇、炮舰的建造费用，合计为6亿8036万日元。加上物价因素在内，实际需要的拨款达7亿6111万日元之巨。而在提出该计划的1919年，日本国会审批的下一年度全国财政预算只有14亿4172万日元。\n1919年12月，防务会议将“八八舰队”案提交给第42届国会，但该届国会于次年2月解散，因此该预算案未成立。1920年6月，日本众议院召开第43届国会，防务会议再度提出此案，终于得到批准，预计到1927年完成。如此浩大的海军军备扩充对当时的日本经济形成严重的负担，1921年日本只能响应美国方面的倡议，在华盛顿召开旨在限制海军军备的会议。\n由于1922年华盛顿海军条约的签定，终止了新的主力舰的建造，使该计划被终止执行。八八舰队计划舰仅战列舰长门级2艘建成。加贺级2艘、战列巡洋舰天城级4艘以及尚未开工的战列舰纪伊级都被中止建造。天城级已开工进度最快的两艘舰天城、赤城按照华盛顿海军条约的规定准许被改装成航空母舰。华盛顿会议中，美国、英国要求日本销毁已下水接近完工的陆奥号战列舰，但在日本的强硬态度下，最终陆奥得以建成。\n八八舰队案造舰计划（大正九年度造舰计划）：\n八八舰队主力舰：\n此外由战列舰扶桑、山城、伊势、日向，战列巡洋舰金刚、比叡、榛名、雾岛组成二线战队，实际形成“八·八·八舰队”。\n##1980年代的八八舰队\n1986年日本海上自卫队参加演习时派出一支由八艘护卫舰和八架反潜直升机组成的舰队，也称为八八舰队。日本海上自卫队所使用之术语中，「八八舰队」是指日本海上自卫队将其主力编组成三个水面打击群（现为四个），每一个打击群都是由八艘水面舰以及八架舰载反潜直升机所编成，因此日本海上自卫队便沿用其大日本帝国海军之旧名，将此种编组称为「八八舰队」。\n但是当日后日本海上自卫队对将其水面打击群兵力扩充，再加入一艘拥有神盾战斗系统的-{zh-hans:金刚级驱逐舰;zh-hk:金刚型护卫舰;zh-tw:金刚级驱逐舰;}-，此型舰虽有直升机甲板但无法维护，可是新编入的DDH能携带并维护三架直升机，故舰队能使用的直升机增为10架，尽管此时编组兵力已经成为九舰十机，但实际上主要目的还是近海防御，故日本海上自卫队并未将其改称为「九十舰队」，沿用了「八八舰队」称呼其水面打击群。", "同义词\n日本八八舰队（日本八八舰队）一般指八八舰队\n\n八八舰队是以八艘战列舰和八艘巡洋舰组成，是日本海军以主力军舰为核心的海军扩充计划，其宗旨是组成强大的海军力量与敌对决。在日本帝国海军的历史上有多个以“八八舰队”为名的海军军备计划。\n\n## 起源\n\n在日本帝国海军的历史上有多个以“八八舰队”为名的海军军备计划。\n1905年5月27日，在日俄对马海峡海战中，东乡平八郎指挥日本联合舰队歼灭了俄国由波罗的海舰队拼凑而成的第二太平洋舰队，一举确立了日本海军强国的地位。从此，大舰巨炮主义便成了海军的传统，日本海军在日俄战争之前的六六舰队基础上规划的八八舰队便随之出笼。\n\n## 舰队年表\n\n20世纪20年代\n1907年由当时海军大臣提出海军军备扩充的构想，简称“八八舰队”，通常由八艘战列舰和八艘装甲巡洋舰组成，由舰龄在8年以内的主力战舰充当。但是其预算一直没有被批准。到第一次世界大战，这个海军扩张计划改为由八艘战列舰和八艘战列巡洋舰组成。\n最先出台的是1915年制订的“八四舰队计划”，即到1923年装备舰龄未满8年的八艘战列舰和四艘战列巡洋舰。\n包括已经建成的以及接近完工的战列舰扶桑级2艘、伊势级2艘，战列巡洋舰金刚级4艘。\n计划拨款建造战列舰长门、陆奥（长门级战列舰）、加贺、土佐（加贺级战列舰），\n和战列巡洋舰天城、赤城（天城级战列巡洋舰），该计划执行期间届时舰龄即将满8年的2艘金刚级的替代舰。\n1918年扩充为“八六舰队计划”，计划拨款建造战列巡洋舰爱宕、高雄（天城级）。\n最后到1920年形成最终“八八舰队计划”，到计划完成时1927年，届时扶桑级、伊势级、金刚级的舰龄将满8年，\n该计划在战列舰长门级2艘、加贺级2艘，战列巡洋舰天城级4艘的基础上，\n再拨款建造4艘战列舰，4艘战列巡洋舰。\n最终的八八舰队计划舰：\n1号舰长门（服役）、\n2号舰陆奥（服役）、\n3号舰加贺（接替天城改建成航空母舰）、\n4号舰土佐（终止）、\n5号舰天城（计划改建成航空母舰，在大地震中损坏后拆毁）、\n6号舰赤城（改建成航空母舰）、\n7号舰爱宕（终止）、8号舰高雄（终止）、\n9号舰纪伊、10号舰尾张、11号舰骏河、12号舰近江，13号舰～16号舰未定（1923年11月19日取消建造）。\n八八舰队计划除主力舰的建造计划以外还包括巡洋舰等 辅助舰艇的建造计划。\n该计划1920年7月由日本国会批准，预计到1927年完成。如此浩大的海军军备扩充对当时的日本经济形成严重的负担，1921年日本只能响应美国方面的倡议，在华盛顿召开旨在限制海军军备的会议。 由于1922年华盛顿海军条约的签定，终止了缔约国新的主力舰的建造，使该计划被终止执行。八八舰队计划舰仅长门级战列舰2艘建成。加贺级2艘、战列巡洋舰天城级4艘以及尚未开工的战列舰纪伊级都被中止建造。天城级已开工进度最快的两艘舰天城、赤城按照华盛顿海军条约的规定准许被改装成航空母舰。华盛顿会议中，美国、英国要求日本销毁已下水接近完工的陆奥号战列舰，但在日本的强硬态度下，最终陆奥得以建成。\n1939年\n1937年，日本摆脱限制海军军备条约约束，日本海军再次提出八八舰队计划，计划建造八艘战列舰和八艘巡洋舰。后来完成了战列舰大和级2艘，太平洋战争爆发后，计划中的大和级3号舰信浓（Shinano）半路改建成航空母舰，4号舰终止建造，其他计划中的四艘舰未命名。另外还有一艘重巡洋舰伊吹在建，后来改建为航空母舰（未完成）。阿苏、生驹、笠置本来都是计划中的重巡洋舰的舰名，但太平洋战争爆发后均尚未开工。这几个名字都用在在建的航空母舰（未完成）。\n20世纪80年代后\n1986年日本参加演习时派出一支由八艘驱逐舰和八架反潜直升机组成的舰队，也称为八八舰队。日本海上自卫队所使用之术语中，「八八舰队」是指日本海上自卫队将其主力编组成水面打击群，每一个打击群都是由八艘水面舰以及八架舰载反潜直升机所编成，因此日本海上自卫队便沿用其日本帝国海军之旧名，将此种编组称为「八八舰队」。\n机动舰队由护卫舰队、潜艇舰队、航空队和直辖队组成，是海上自卫队的一线部队，约占日本海上自卫队实力的60%，主要承担保卫海上交通线，执行中远海反潜、机动作战和护航等任务。其主力水面战斗舰艇配备于护卫舰队之下，共分为4个护卫队群，每个护卫队群再下辖1艘作为旗舰的直升机驱逐舰，以及3个护卫队，其中2个护卫队使用通用型驱逐舰、 1个护卫队使用防空驱逐舰，每个护卫队由2、3艘驱逐舰组成。1个护卫队群的军舰，恰好可以组成一支“八·八舰队”，即1艘直升机驱逐舰、2艘防空型驱逐舰和5艘通用型驱逐舰，再配以8架直升机（直升机驱逐舰携带3架，通用型驱逐舰每舰一机）。\n1986年日本海上自卫队对将其水面打击群兵力扩充，再加入一艘拥有宙斯盾雷达系统的金刚级驱逐舰，同时此一级水面舰可装傤两架多任务旋翼机，尽管此时编组兵力已经成为九舰十机，但日本海上自卫队并未将其改称为「九十舰队」，只是改为低调不再积极以「八八舰队」称呼其水面打击群。\n\n##

（DD102）、“雷”（DD107）号；第5护卫队：含高波级（亦可视为改进村雨级）驱逐舰“高波”号（DD110）、“大波”号（DD111）；以及第61护卫队：含旗风级驱逐舰“旗风”号（DDG171）、金刚级驱逐舰“雾岛”号（DDG174）。该护卫队群所有舰只均配置于横须贺。\n\n### 第2护卫队群\n\n旗舰为白根级直升机驱逐舰“鞍马”号（DDH144）；该护卫队群还辖有第2护卫队：含朝雾级驱逐舰“山雾”号（DD152）、“泽雾”号 （DD157）；第6护卫队：含村雨级驱逐舰“夕立”（DD103）、“雾雨”（DD104）、“有明”（DD109）；第62护卫队：含太刀风级驱逐舰 “泽风”号（DDG170）、金刚级驱逐舰“金刚”号（DDG173）。该护卫队群驻扎于佐世保。\n\n### 第3护卫队群\n\n旗舰为榛名级直升机驱逐舰“榛名”号（DDH141）；该护卫队群还辖有第3护卫队：含初雪级驱逐舰“滨雪”号、朝雾级驱逐舰“天雾”号 （DD154）；第7护卫队：含朝雾级驱逐舰“夕雾”号（DD153）、“滨雾”号（DD155）、“濑户雾”号（DD156）；第63护卫队：含旗风级驱逐舰“岛风”号（DDG172）、金刚级驱逐舰“妙高”号（DDG175），该护卫队群分驻舞鹤（“榛名”号、第3、63护卫队）及大凑（第7护卫队）两地。\n\n### 第4护卫队群\n\n旗舰为榛名级直升机驱逐舰 “比睿”号（DDH142）；该护卫队群还辖有第4护卫队：含村雨级驱逐舰“电”号（DD105）、“五月雨”号（DD106）、“曙”号 （DD108）；第8护卫队：含朝雾级驱逐舰“朝雾”号（151）、“海雾”号（158）号；第64护卫队：含太刀风级驱逐舰“朝风”号（169）、金刚级驱逐舰“鸟海”号（DDG176）。其中“比睿”号、第4、8护卫队部署在吴，第64护卫队部署在佐世保。\n\n### 数量\n\n经计算可知，护卫舰队1986年总计拥有白根级直升机驱逐舰2艘，榛名级直升机驱逐舰2艘，金刚级驱逐舰4艘，村雨级驱逐舰9艘，高波级驱逐舰2艘，朝雾级驱逐舰8艘，初雪级驱逐舰1艘，旗风级驱逐舰2艘，太刀风级驱逐舰3艘。\n\n### 配置\n\n按照日本的规划，“八·八舰队”中：直升机驱逐舰载3架HSS-2B反潜直升机，担任舰队指挥舰并负责反潜，金刚级驱逐舰和旗风或太刀风级防空驱逐舰，主要担负编队的防空任务；5艘通用型驱逐舰，各载一架HSS-2B反潜直升机，用于反潜、反舰作战。此外，还配备一艘8000吨级的远洋综合补给船，担负舰队的远洋补给保障。\n\n## 发展\n\n整个20世纪90年代，日本已经实施了亲潮级和春潮级潜艇、金刚级、村雨级和高波级驱逐舰、阿武隈级护卫舰、大隅级船坞运输舰、浦贺级扫雷支援舰、菅岛级沿海扫雷艇以及一批辅助舰艇在内的庞大的发展计划，下一步即将开始的，便是2艘改进型金刚级驱逐舰（最终可能建造4艘）和2艘13500吨级直升机驱逐舰，甚至包括远景的航空母舰计划等。高波级的后续舰也将继续建造，以替换护卫舰队中剩余的几艘初雪级和朝雾级驱逐舰。"],

药品简介\n\n### 药理作用\n\n其膜效应与细胞外钾离子浓度、心肌状态及血药浓度有关，当细胞外钾浓度低时，低浓度药增加0相除极最大速率及动作电位幅度，加速传导，有利于消除泮地黄中毒合并低钾时的心律失常及单向阻滞所致的折返性心律失常。当细胞外钾浓度正常或升高，高浓度药则起抑制作用，但明显低于其他抗心律失常药的抑制作用。本品缩短动作电位间期及有效不应期，但前者缩短更显著，故相对延长有效不应期，有利于消除折返性激动所致心律失常。本品还可能抑制钙离子内流，这是与其他局麻药抗心律失常作用不同之处。此外还可降低心肌自律性、抑制交感中枢减少其传出冲动及提高心房颤动与心室颤动阈值。以上作用对心室的影响均大于心房。对心电图影响小，可缩短P-R及Q-T间期,对QRS波无影响。对原有心脏病变者可抑制收缩力。静脉用药可扩张周围血管。\n\n### 药代动力学\n\n口服吸收较慢，85～90%由小肠吸收，新生儿吸收甚差。静脉注射吸收快速；肌注吸收不完全且不规则，一次量峰值仅为口服的1/3。口服片剂的生物利用度约为75%，吸收后分布于细胞内外液，细胞内可能多于细胞外。蛋白结合率很高，为88～92%,主要与白蛋白结合，在脑组织内蛋白结合可能还可略高。\n口服药4～12小时血药浓度达峰值，有效血药浓度为10～20μg/mL，每日口服300mg时约7～10时可达稳态浓度，血药浓度超过20μg/mL易产生毒性反应，出现眼球震颤，超过30μg/mL出现共济失调，超过40μg/mL往往出现严重毒性。半衰期苯妥英平均为22小时，但变异范围很大（7～42小时）；长期服用苯妥英钠的患者半衰期可因人、因浓度而异可为15～95小时不等，甚至更长。主要在肝内代谢，代谢物无药理活性，其中主要为羟基苯妥英（约占50～70%），经肾排泄，碱性尿排泄较快。在应用一定剂量药物后肝脏代谢能力达饱和，此时即使增加很小剂量就易造成血药浓度不成比例地升高，出现毒性反应，为零级药代动力学的典型药物，所以在有效血药浓度低值时，每次增加剂量以每日50mg为宜，当血药浓度达到15μg/mL时，增加剂量以每日25mg为妥。增加剂量后应观察2～3周以达到新的稳态血药浓度，因为此时的半衰期变长，所以达到稳态浓度的时间也延长，且可避免假稳态现象。\n\n### 适应症\n\n适用于治疗全身性强直-阵挛性发作、复杂部分性发作（精神运动性发作、颞叶癫痫）、单纯部分性发作（局限性发作）和癫痫持续状态。也可用于治疗三叉神经痛，隐性营养不良性大疱性表皮松解（recessivedystrophicepidermolysisbullosa），发作性舞蹈手足徐动症，发作性控制障碍（包括发怒、焦虑和失眠的兴奋过度等的行为障碍疾患），肌强直症及三环类抗抑郁药过量时心脏传导障碍等。苯妥英钠不能控制失神小发作，如伴有失神发作时，需合用其他药物。\n下为苯妥英钠抗心律失常的叙述：主要适用于洋地黄中毒所致的室性及室上性心律失常（对室性早搏、室性心动过速疗效较室上性心动过速、心房颤动及心房扑动好）。对其他各种原因的心律失常疗效则较差，包括合并\n\n### 用法用量\n\n抗癫痫\n1、口服成人常用量：每日250-300mg，开始时100mg，每日2次，在1-3周内加至每日250-300mg，分3次服用，但由于个体差异及饱和动力学的特点，用药需个体化。在分次应用达到控制和血药浓度达稳态后可考虑改用长效制剂一次顿服。如果发作频繁，需很快达到治疗有效血药浓度，可将按体重12-15mg/kg药量分成2-3次服用，每6小时1次，第二天开始给予100mg（或按体重1.5-2mg/kg），每日3次，直到调整至恰当剂量为止。用作胶原酶合成抑制剂时，先用每日按体重2-3mg/kg分2次服用，在2-3周内增加到患者能够耐受的用量，血药浓度至少达到8μg/mL，一般每日100-300mg。\n小儿常用量：开始时每日按体重5mg/kg分2-3次服用，以后按需要调整，以每日不超过250mg为度。维持量为每日按体重4-8mg/kg或按体表面积250mg/m\n2、注射成人常用量：抗惊厥，150-250mg，每分钟不超过50mg，需要时30分钟后可再次静注100-150mg，一日总量不超过500mg。老年、重病和肝功能受损患者，静注量要减少，注速也减慢到每2-3分钟50mg，以免发生不良或中毒反应。\n小儿常用量：抗惊厥时可按体重静注5mg/kg或按体表面积250mg/m\n（1）对乙内酰脲类中的一种药过敏者，对其他同族药如甲芬妥英、乙苯妥英也可能过敏。\n（2）有致癌的报道，包括在妊娠时服用，分娩后小儿患有神经母细胞瘤。\n（3）本品可通过胎盘，虽然与致畸的关系尚不明，但利弊应加考虑。绝大多数患有癫痫妇女服用本品都仍分娩正常婴儿，但有报道认为在孕期服用本品，婴儿先天性异常包括兔唇、腭裂、心脏异常和“胎儿苯妥英综合征”（产前生长缺陷、小头、颅面异常，指甲发育不良和精神发育缺陷）等发生率较高。至于这些致畸是由于母体癫痫发作本身还是由于用药所致，仍有争论。一般认为癫痫发作的控制不佳致畸的危险性可能大于用药的致畸。临床上凡是用苯妥英钠能够控制发作的患者，在怀孕期间应当继续使用，并保持有效的血药浓度。由于妊娠时苯妥英钠的吸收和代谢会有改变，应经常监测血药浓度，遇有发作次数增多，应增加用量，分娩后再重新调整。\n（4）服用苯妥英钠的孕妇所分娩的新生儿发生危及生命的出血的危险性增高（通常在出生后24小时内）。苯妥英还可使母体维生素K减少，也有增加分娩时出血的危险，预防性地在分娩前一个月及分娩时给母体以水溶性维生素K，在产后立即给予新生儿静注维生素K可以减少出血的危险性。\n（5）苯妥英钠可经乳腺分泌进入乳汁，为安全起见，一般主张不要用服苯妥英钠的母乳喂养。\n（6）老年人慢性低蛋白血症的发生率往往较高，治疗上合并用药又较多，药物彼此间相互作用复杂，所以老年人应用苯妥英钠时需慎重，用量应偏低，并经常监测血药浓度。静脉注射时速度需减慢，2-3分钟内不超过50mg。老年人较易嗜睡，最好在睡前服用。\n（7）小儿由于分布容积与消除半衰期随年龄而变化，因此儿科病人应经常作血药浓度测定。早产儿的表观分布容积平均为1.2L/kg，足月平产儿为0.8L/kg，如此保持恒定一般达96周。初生儿在三个月内苯妥英的蛋白结合率降低，游离苯妥英可升高40%，所以总的血药浓度维持在6-14μg/mL的较低水平，不足月婴儿的苯妥英1/2显著延长，反映肝脏的不成熟性和不易代谢苯妥英。在子宫内受过苯妥英钠影响的婴儿的代谢速度较快，可能是肝脏代谢酶受到诱导的\n结果，由于新生儿和婴儿期间苯妥英的这种药动学特殊性，临床上对中毒症状评定有困难，一般不首先考虑采用本品。学龄前儿童需要有系统地测定血药浓度以决定每日用量和给药次数，有的儿童需每日15mg/kg以维持治疗浓度，由于幼年期间肝脏代谢能力强而且快，半衰期较短。峰值期可能出现中毒症状，谷值时又嫌血药浓度偏低而发作，务必多次测定血药浓度，了解波动的详情。\n（8）苯妥英钠较常见的并发症为齿龈增生，一般在治疗开始后6个月内发生齿龈炎，15岁以下儿童的发生率高于成人。前部齿龈的增生比后部严重。如果在治疗开始10日内加强口腔清洁卫生和加用夹板，可以减低齿龈增生的速度和程度。\n（9）用药期间需注意检查：血象及血小板计数、肝功能、淋巴结、皮肤、血钙、口腔、脑电图、血药浓度和甲状腺功能等。血药浓度须经常进行随访，防止毒性反应，在妊娠期，每月测定一项以确定是否需要增加用量，产后每周一次以决定是否需要减量。\n（10）为了减轻胃肠道反应，应在饭后立即服用或与牛奶同服。需按时服用，如果漏服，应在下次服药前4小时立即补服，不要把两次用量一次服下。\n（11）糖尿病患者测定尿糖量，如需进行手术治疗应说明病史和用药情况。驾车、操纵机器或需要非常警觉的工作时要谨慎。注意口腔卫生，清洁牙齿，以防止齿龈出血和肿胀。\n（12）本品的个体差异很大，用量需个体化，有的病人用至150mg即可出现中毒症状，每日300mg时亦有不少患者出现中毒症状，适当减量后既可达到治疗目的，中毒症状亦消失，故中国人每日常用量在250-300mg之间，个别患者则可适量增加，西方人每日300mg则往往不够。老年或重病患者或肝功能受损患者苯妥英的代谢趋于缓慢，因此达到中毒浓度的可能性增加。白蛋白减少或蛋白结合减少的患者在血药浓度较低时就可能出现中毒症状，用量需减少，如果需要静脉注射，注速宜减慢，每2-3分钟不超过50mg。决定停药时需逐渐减量，以免发作更加频繁，甚至出现持续状态。\n（13）患者不能耐受或有过敏反应，需立即停药，一般在开始治疗后观察9-14天。如果皮疹为荨麻疹样或腥红热样，在皮疹消退后可以再次试用，如皮疹复出，则应停用。如果皮疹为片状，紫癜性、大疱性或红斑狼疮样或疑有重型多型红斑，不能再次试用。如有淋巴结增大，需进行有关淋巴结增大的鉴别诊断。\n（14）出现中枢神经或小脑中毒症状时，减量或停药可以改善或消失。中枢神经的影响，常在长期应用而且血药浓度超过30μg/mL后发生，偶有低浓度时就可发生的。维生素D和钙代谢紊乱，可先给予大量维生素D2，每日4000单位持续4个月，以后每日维持量1000单位，不必预防性给药。本品可增加房室传导，故对室性心律失常合并心房颤动或心房扑动时，可使心室率增快，也可因房室结隐匿性传导减轻使心室率增快。\n\n### 不良反应\n\n1、较常见的有行为改变，笨拙或步态不稳，思维混乱、持续性眼球震颤、发作次数增多，精神改变，肌力减弱，发音不清，手抖或长期应用引起的中枢神经系统或小脑中毒所致的不正常兴奋、神经质或烦躁易怒，齿龈肿胀、出血，多毛；\n2、较少见的有颈部或腋部淋巴结肿大（IgA减少），发热或皮疹（不能耐受或过敏）；\n3、罕见的反应有尿色发暗，大便色淡，食欲减退，严重的胃痛，眼或皮肤发黄（肝炎或肝汁郁积性黄疸），骨折、骨质异常或生长缓慢（维生素D和钙代谢紊乱）、咽痛和发热（粒细胞缺失或不能耐药）、出血或瘀斑（血小板减少）；\n4、过量的症状有视力模糊或复视，笨拙或行走不稳和蹒跚，精神混乱，严重的眩晕或嗜睡，幻觉，恶心，语言不清。嗜睡，搔痒，眩晕，头痛，恶心，呕吐，皮疹。肌肉震颤，视物模糊，紫癜，精神失常或错乱。注入过快可引起低血压，心动过缓，房室传导阻滞，血管性虚脱，呼吸抑制。常见巨细胞贫血。个别病例白细胞减少，再生障碍性贫血。小儿长期使用影响骨骼生长（或骨软化）牙龈增生。它可致有中枢神经系统抑制、小脑功能障碍、运动失常及末梢神经病。\n牙龈增生是它的典型而麻烦的不良反应。可发生间质性肺炎、间质性肾炎，偶可产生肝损害。静注大剂量可引起心脏毒性作用。它可产生过敏综合征伴有皮肤、肌肉、肺、血液、网织内皮系统、肝、肾及血管损害和发热。可出现成神经细胞瘤伴有胎儿苯妥英综合症。它可致假性淋巴瘤而非恶性淋巴瘤。\n心血管系统\n口服苯妥英治疗癫痫时对心脏无大的影响，有时可出现血压明显下降。静注小剂量可发生暂时性低血压，甚至可诱发心律失常。静注大剂量可发生严重心动过缓、低血压及晕厥。有报告1例发生过敏性心肌炎。应用此药治疗心律失常时，偶可诱发不可逆的心律改变如室性心动过速，可招致死亡。在手术麻醉前应停用此药，以免术中诱发房室或室内传导障碍。\n呼吸系统\n由于此药诱发急性过敏性血管炎而引起发热、呼吸困难、低氧血症及双侧肺浸润，其病理过程为间质性肺炎伴弥漫性炎性渗出物侵及肺泡腔及间质组织，致肺泡壁增厚，炎症也侵及血管周围间质及血管壁。停药及应用皮质激素治疗有效。\n神经系统\n当血中苯妥英浓度达30～40μg/mL，将出现共济失调，再升高则发生思睡及语言障碍，甚至在正常治疗剂量可产生小脑综合征伴有共济失调、眼球震颤、构音障碍及震颤。有些报告苯妥英可能致有真正的小脑萎缩，特别是有严重的脑病及精神功能不正常的患者，通过气脑造影及CT检查证实，组织学证实为小脑退行性变。应当考虑为频发的癫痫发作所致的反复长期缺氧所致。但也有报告认为明显的与病期长及用药总量有关，而与发作次数无关。苯妥英可致有运动紊乱，常见的是舞蹈手足徐动症；偶尔出现张力障碍。有报告发生重症肌无力加重、帕金森综合征、使迟发性运动障碍加重者。运动过度仅见于血清苯妥英浓度过高，特别是有脑器质性损害的患者。偶见有末梢神经病，但较轻，如反射消失不伴有肌肉消瘦及无力，感觉无改变或稍有改变。应用叶酸治疗有效。\n消化系统\n应用苯妥英治疗的患者40～80%发生齿龈增生，并与剂量及血清浓度有关。如彻底去除齿龈上的牙垢及刷牙，重视口腔卫生，可使之减轻，应用叶酸治疗有效。一次应用苯妥英过量时可引起腹泻。苯妥英偶可致有中毒性肝炎。\n泌尿系统\n因苯妥英过敏反应，偶见有间质性肾炎伴可逆性肾功能衰竭，一般同时伴有皮疹、肌炎、发热、淋巴结肿大、嗜酸细胞增多及过敏反应性肝炎。停药及应用皮质激素治疗可恢复。有报告用美芬妥英可出现肾病综合征。\n造血系统\n苯妥英可致有巨成红细胞性贫血、全细胞贫血及播散性红斑狼疮，但很罕见；而应用美芬妥英见有再生不良性贫血。另有报告发生粒细胞减少、溶血性贫血伴肾衰、单纯性红细胞再生不良者。曾有报道，长期应用苯妥英预防癫痫发作，可产生自家抗体及中和因子Ⅷ的抑制物，发生后天获得的自发性血友病。\n内分泌、代谢\n苯妥英使血中硫胺明显减低。它影响肝脏的脂质代谢，可诱发或加重甘油三酯及胆固醇升高。苯妥英可使血中高密度脂蛋白胆固醇持久升高，近半数患者超过正常范围，可能有助于预防冠心病的发生。苯妥英抑制胰岛素分泌而致血糖升高。大量应用苯妥英的患者与对照的健康人相对比，发现血清碱性磷酸酶、丙氨酸转氨酶及血浆凝血酶原时间明显增高，血清白蛋白、钙及胆红素减低。应用苯妥英患者的血清铜升高两倍，而与剂量无关。\n特殊感官\n血清苯妥英浓度升高达到显著影响意识时（35～55μg/mL），可诱致所有的眼外肌麻痹，患者恢复后，尽管眼的运动恢复，但眼-脑反射及眼-前庭反射仍受抑制，苯妥英对前庭-眼运动系统似有直接抑制作用，此作用比抑制神经系统其他部位为强。血清浓度略高于治疗浓度时，足以诱致眼球震颤。当苯妥英中毒时可出现虹膜震颤。\n皮肤\n可出现各种皮疹，多为斑丘疹样红斑，也有发生多型性红斑者。有报告发生耳后皱襞增生、表皮坏死溶解者。静脉注射有发生注射部位皮肤及软组织反应，表现为局部青紫并发展为红斑及水肿，甚至有发生水泡及大疱者。有报告发生弥漫性筋膜炎伴嗜酸细胞增多及高丙种球蛋白血症，表现为臂及小腿的皮肤皮下组织变厚，面部及手脚部位改变较轻，其原因不明。\n网状内皮系统\n苯妥英作用于网状内皮系统使淋巴结、肝脾肿大(一般是可逆的)，诱致假性淋巴瘤，这是过敏反应。曾有报告应用苯妥英伴发不可逆的恶性淋巴瘤。\n免疫反应\n许多报告认为应用苯妥英患者血中IgA浓度减低。在抗癫痫药影响下，细胞免疫功能不全，可能与上述发生淋巴瘤的危险性加大有关。肾移植患者同时应用苯妥英治疗反复发作的癫痫，苯妥英可使免疫抑制剂皮质类固醇的代谢增加，则影响移植肾的存活。苯妥英过敏综合征，从皮疹伴发热到暴发性致死性剥脱性皮炎、血管炎、弥漫性血管内凝血。最常见的是发热、嗜酸细胞增多、淋巴结病、肝脾肿大、不典型的淋巴细胞血液病、血清病、肝炎及肾衰分别联合出现，可出现多发性肌炎。\n过量\n口服过量可发生意识障碍、低血压、呼吸抑制、不安、咂嘴、恐慌性抽搐、皮肤湿冷、反射亢进、易激动，伸跖反射阳性。\n\n### 用药禁忌\n\n1、下列情况应禁用；对乙内酰脲类药有过敏史者及阿斯综合征、Ⅱ-Ⅲ度房室阻滞、窦房阻滞、窦性心动过缓等心功能损害患者。\n2、下列情况应慎用：\n① 嗜酒，本品的血药浓度可降低；\n② 贫血，严重感染的危险性增加；\n③ 心血管病，尤其是老年人，注药时可引起室颤或减少心搏出量；\n④ 糖尿病，血糖可能升高；\n⑤ 肝功能损害，本品的代谢改变；\n⑥ 肾功能损害，可影响本品的排泄；\n⑦ 甲状腺功能异常，可能由于分解代谢加速而使血清T4浓度降低。小儿长期使用影响骨骼生长（或骨软化），牙龈增生。可能致畸，孕妇禁用。妊娠末期应用苯妥英，婴儿的凝血因子受抑制，足以引起出血，在这种情况下应给予维生素K。\n\n### 相互作用\n\n1、长期应用对乙酰氨基酚患者应用苯妥英钠可增加肝脏中毒的危险性，而且疗效降低。\n2、与肾上腺皮质激素、糖皮质激素和盐皮质激素类、含雌激素的口服避孕药、促肾上腺皮质激素、环孢菌素、洋地黄类、雌激素、左旋多巴或奎尼丁合用时，这些药物的疗效可降低，因为苯妥英钠诱导肝代谢酶。\n3、长期饮酒可减低苯妥英钠的浓度和疗效，但服苯妥英钠的同时大量饮酒可增加血药浓度；与抗凝剂如香豆素类或氯霉素、异烟肼、保泰松、磺胺类合用，由于它们可减低苯妥英钠的代谢，所以可能增加苯妥英钠的效果和/（或）毒性；与香豆素类抗凝剂合用时，开始可增加抗凝效应，但持续应用时则降低。\n4、与含镁、铝或碳酸钙的制酸剂合用时可能降低苯妥英钠的生物利用度，制酸药应与苯妥英或苯妥英钠相隔2～3小时分开服用。\n5、与口服降糖药或与胰岛素合用时，可能需要注意并调整后两者的用量，因为苯妥英可使血糖升高。\n6、长期应用多巴胺的患者，静注苯妥英钠时可能引起突然性低血压和心率减慢，且认为与后者的用量和吸收速度有关，原则上用多巴胺的患者，需用抗惊厥药时，不宜考虑用苯妥英。\n7、静注苯妥英钠与利多卡因或普萘洛尔（心得安）合用时可能加强心脏的抑制作用。\n8、虽然苯妥英消耗体内的叶酸，但加叶酸反而可降低苯妥英的浓度而削弱发作的控制。\n9、苯巴比妥或扑米酮对苯妥英的影响，变化很大，应经常检测血药浓度；与丙戊酸或丙戊酸钠合用时，有对蛋白结合率竞争的作用，应经常监测血药浓度，并根据临床情况调整苯妥英钠的用量。\n10、苯妥英钠与卡马西平合用，可通过肝代谢诱导酶而降低卡马西平的血药浓度；据估计每日1mg/kg的苯妥英钠可以降低卡马西平血药浓度0.5μg/mL。如合并用大量的抗精神病药或三环类抗抑郁药可能会诱发癫痫发作，中枢神经的抑制可更明显，需调整苯妥英钠用量。异烟肼、戒酒硫、磺胺甲噻唑、氯霉素、咪康唑、保泰松及双香豆素使血清苯妥英浓度升高并增加其毒性作用。苯妥英可加强降压药、利尿药、洋地黄、奎尼丁、普鲁卡因胺及普萘洛尔的作用。苯妥英使地塞米松的血中浓度降低，而地塞米松也使苯妥英的浓度升高。苯妥英降低口服避孕药的作用，有报告使受孕的机会加大25倍。苯妥英与鼻饲物中的蛋白及钙有相互作用，致使苯妥英的生物利用率降低，如对此无认识，当血清浓度下降时则增加剂量，一旦停用鼻饲则将发生中毒。\n\n##

{"name": "大政翼赞会", "documents": ["简称“翼赞会”。日本第二届近卫内阁为推进“新体制运动”而建立的法西斯政治组织。1940年10月12日成立。总裁由内阁首相近卫文麿担任，事务总长有马赖宁。下设组织、政策、规划、议会、总务局。在道府县、郡、市、区、镇、村各支部与各级行政之间设置常设联络委员会，作为基层行政机构的辅助，强化法西斯统治。在中央和地方，还仿照意大利法西斯的职业代表协议会，建立大政翼政协议会，议员由总裁和支部长任命。1942年1月，其外围组织大日本翼赞壮年团，发起农村更生运动。还成立生产联盟、产业报国运动等法西斯组织，作为翼赞会的一部分。它对内积极协助日本政府实行国民精神动员，强化军国主义体制;对外则在所谓“大东亚共荣圈”内扩张帝国的势力，并大规模地组织其辅助兴亚联盟，以协助日本帝国主义统治殖民地。同年5月翼赞政治会独立出去。1945年6月13日自行消失。\n\n## 简介\n\n成立后的首任总裁为近卫文麿（日本语：このえ ふみまろ）。日本发动全面侵华战争后，日益内外交困。为摆脱困境，近卫内阁试图仿照德、意法西斯体制，在日本国内以达成“国防国家”为目标，解散现有政党，推行舆论划一、一国一党的“新体制运动”。1940年6月，由近卫文麿出面，发起这场运动。七、八月间，社会大众党、政友会、民政党等先后宣告解散。8月23日，近卫成立新体制筹备会，吸收桥本欣五郎、绪方竹虎、武藤章等军政界要人参加活动。10月12日，新体制的具体成果大政翼赞会正式成立。\n\n## 宗旨\n\n大政翼赞会的宗旨是“实践翼赞大政的臣道，上意下达，下情上通，密切配合政府”。总理大臣近卫亲任总裁，各地支部长由都道府县知事兼任。在中央和地方分设大政翼赞协议会，开展法西斯精神总动员，大力推行军国主义法西斯教育。大政翼赞会还把产业报国会和日本妇女组织纳入体制，甚至在东亚的侵略地区亦有组织。日本随即进入“一君万民”、“万民翼赞”的军事法西斯“总力战”体制。\n日本战败前夕，大政翼赞会于1945年6月解散。\n\n## 相关\n\n所谓“翼赞”，就是“帮助天皇”的意思。大政翼赞会是国民总动员体制的核心组织。它通过上意下达的方式，引导国民的思想精神运动。作为下部组织，设置有道府县支部、市区町（镇）村支部、街道居委会、邻里组等。1942年4月的众议院议员选举中，由军部、财界人士组成的“翼赞政治体制协议会”选定了和众议院定数相同的推荐候补人数并令之参加选举，使得整个选举成了“翼赞选举”。此次选举刚刚结束，就成立了以众议院议员为中心的政治团体“翼赞政治会”，确立了其与政府及大政翼赞会的三位一体的翼赞政治体制。\n\n## 实践纲要\n\n大政翼赞会在召开成立大会的时候，并没有发表什么纲领和宣言，到了1940年12月14日，发表了如下的实践纲要。\n现在世界正面临具有历史意义的转变时期，以实现八纮一宇为国家根本大计的皇国，须万众一心，竭尽全力奉戴天皇，确立物心一体的国家体制，借以成为世界道义上的光辉领导者。\n现在，本会将互助互诫，提高皇国臣民的觉悟，率先成为国民的楷模，始终与政府互为表里，同心协力，以求上意下达，下情上通，努力实现高度国防国家。\n一、国民积极实践襄助国政的“臣道”。即无限信仰体现无上绝对普遍真理的国体，忠实遵奉历代诏敕的谕旨，竭力发扬明治维新的传统精神。\n二、协助建设大东亚共荣圈。即在完善大东亚共荣体制，谋求其兴盛的同时，进而努力建立世界新秩序。\n三、协助建设翼赞政治体制。即以翼赞精神统一经济、文化生活，努力建立强有力的综合性政治体制。\n四、努力建设翼赞经济体制。即最大限度地发挥创新能力与科学，建立综合性的计划经济，借以谋求生产飞跃发展，努力建成大东亚的自给自足经济。\n五、协助建设文化新体制。即根据国体精神，造就雄浑、高雅、明朗且又富有科学性的新日本文化，内则振奋民族精神，外则努力发扬大东亚文化。\n六、协助建设生活新体制。即扩大公益，开展社会工作工作，培育推进新时代的理想与气魄，努力树立全体国民悉为一家成员而团结在国家理想之下的生活体制。", "## 大政翼赞会\n大政翼赞会（f=h）是日本帝国在第二次世界大战期间的一个极右翼政治团体，于1940年10月12日宣告成立，1945年6月13日解散。其以推动政治权力集中的「新体制运动」作为主要目标，将既有的政党解散成一个全国性的政治组织，以一党专政的模式统治日本。\n由于当时任何形式的结社自由均被管制，大政翼赞会因而自称是一种为了公共目的而成立的「公事结社」。虽然自身认为是一个超越党派的组织，但战后被广泛被认为是与同时代之纳粹德国的执政党纳粹党和意大利王国执政党法西斯党相似的独裁政党，较不同之处是大政翼赞会采取多数决，与上述政党多为个人独裁相异。除了位于首都东京的中央本部外，在全国各地设有道府县支部、大都市支部、市区町村支部、町内会、部落会等分支机构。\n## 历史\n大政翼赞会成立后，曾与许多功能类似的团体合并、也成立许多外围团体，例如1942年5月26日成立的「日本文学报国会」、1942年12月23日成立的「大日本言论报国会」等。\n在当时太平洋战争爆发的情势下，以大政翼赞会为中心、对军部的方针给予支持的政治体制，被称为「翼赞体制」，无论是政府运作、公共政策、产业发展、文化教育等各种国政事务，均在这种体系下被大政翼赞会及其外围团体紧密掌握。\n1945年3月30日，其旗下肩负议会政党职责的翼賛政治会改组为「大日本政治会」（1945年的战后进一步组成日本进步党），大政翼赞会本身则在同年6月被解散并入因应本土决战而成立的「国民义勇队」。"],

{"name": "中国茶文化", "documents": ["中国茶文化是中国制茶、饮茶的文化  。中国是茶的故乡，中国人发现并利用茶，据说始于神农时代，少说也有4700多年了。直到现在，汉族还有民以茶代礼的风俗\n。潮州工夫茶作为中国茶文化的古典流派，集中了中国茶道文化的精粹，作为中国茶道的代表入选国家级非物质文化遗产\n，2022年，中国传统制茶技艺及其相关习俗被列入联合国教科文组织非物质文化遗产名录。\n日本的煎茶道、中国台湾地区的泡茶道都来源于中国广东潮州的工夫茶\n。\n作为开门七件事（柴米油盐酱醋茶）之一，饮茶在古代中国是非常普遍的。中华茶文化源远流长，博大精深，不但包含物质文化层面，还包含深厚的精神文明层次。唐代茶圣陆羽的茶经在历史上吹响了中华茶文化的号角。从此茶的精神渗透了宫廷和社会，深入中国的诗词、绘画、书法、宗教、医学。好几千年来中国不但积累了大量关于茶叶种植、生产的物质文化、更积累了丰富的有关茶的精神文化，这就是中国特有的茶文化，属于文化学范畴。\n\n## 茶文化\n\n中国人饮茶，注重一个“品”字。“品茶”不但是鉴别茶的优劣，也带有神思遐想和领略饮茶情趣之意。在百忙之中泡上一壶浓茶，择雅静之处，自斟自饮，可以消除疲劳、涤烦益思、振奋精神，也可以细啜慢饮，达到美的享受，使精神世界升华到高尚的艺术境界。品茶的环境一般由建筑物、园林、摆设、茶具等因素组成。饮茶要求安静、清新、舒适、干净。中国园林世界闻名，山水风景更是不可胜数。利用园林或自然山水间，用木头做亭子、凳子，搭设茶室，给人一种诗情画意。供人们小憩，不由意趣盎然。\n中国茶艺在世界享有盛誉，在唐代就传入日本，形成日本茶道。日本的煎茶道、台湾的泡茶道都来源于中国广东潮州的工夫茶。\n潮州工夫茶艺是国家级非物质文化遗产，是广东省潮汕地区特有的传统饮茶习俗，是潮汕茶文化和潮汕茶道重要组成部分，是中国茶艺中最具代表性的一种，是融精神、礼仪、沏泡技艺、巡茶艺术、评品质量为一体的完整的茶道形式，既是一种茶艺，也是一种民俗，是“潮人习尚风雅，举措高超”的象征。\n潮州工夫茶，在当地十分普遍，均以茶会友。不论是公众场合还是在居民家中，不论是路边村头还是工厂商店，无处不见人们长斟短酌。品茶并不仅为了达到解渴的目的，而且还在品茶中或联络感情，或互通信息，或闲聊消遣，或洽谈贸易，潮州工夫茶蕴含着丰富的文化内容。\n\n潮州工夫茶是中国古老的传统茶文化中最有代表性的茶道，在潮汕当地更是把茶作为了待客的最佳礼仪。这不仅是因为茶在许多方面有着养生的作用，更因为自古以来茶就有\"待君子，清心身\"的意境。喝工夫茶是广东潮汕人一项日常生活中最平常不过的事，饭后或者客人来访、好友相见，都是以一壶茶来相伴。\n\n很多人喜欢这种泡茶和喝茶的艺术，包括不是中国人的人。很多人热心于茶艺，他们不仅喜爱茶的味道\n，也享受泡茶过程中的乐趣。茶文化非常吸引人，此外还能放松心灵。据说人们在泡茶和喝茶的时候能忘记生活中的所有烦恼。很多人喜欢和别人一起喝茶，不光为分享美茶，还为了体验和别人在一起的安逸心情。\n唐代陆羽所著《茶经》系统的总结了唐代以及唐以前茶叶生产，饮用的经验，提出了精行俭德的茶道精神。陆羽和皎然等一批文化人非常重视茶的精神享受和道德规范，讲究饮茶用具、饮茶用水和煮茶艺术，并与儒、道、佛哲学思想交融，而逐渐使人们进入他们的精神领域。在一些士大夫和文人雅士的饮茶过程中，还创作了很多茶诗，仅在《全唐诗》中，流传至今的就有百余位诗人的四百余首，从而奠定中国茶文化的基础。茶叶，为中国茶坛大放异彩。\n\n## 形成与发展\n\n### 综述\n\n中国是茶的故乡，是世界上最早发现中国茶树、利用中国茶叶和栽培中国茶树的国家，中国也是世界茶道的宗主国，任何国家受中国茶文化的影响都不能否认中国是茶道宗主国的地位，否则违背了茶道的基本文明。茶树的起源至少已有六七万年的历史。茶被人类发现和利用，大约有四五千年的历史。\n茶的利用最初是孕育于野生采集活动之中的。古史传说中认为“神农乃玲珑玉体，能见其肺肝五脏”，理由是，“若非玲珑玉体，尝药一日遇十二毒，何以解之。”又有说“神农尝百草，日遇七十二毒，得茶而解之\n。”两说虽均不能尽信，但一缕微弱的信息却值得注意：“茶”在长久的食用过程中，人们越来注重它的某些疗病的“药”用之性。这反映的是一种洪荒时代的传佚之事。\n依照《诗经》等有关文献记录，在史前期，“荼”是泛指诸类苦味野生植物性食物原料的，从发现了茶的其他价值后才有了独立的名字“茶”。在食医合一的历史时代，茶类植物油的止渴、清神、消食、除瘴、利便等到药用功能是不难为人们所发现的。然而，由一般性的药用发展为习常的专用饮料，还必须有某种特别的的因素，即人们实际生活中的某种特定需要。巴蜀地区，向为疾疫多发的“烟瘴”之地。“番民以茶为生，缺之必病。”（清·周蔼联《竺国游记》卷二）故巴蜀人俗常饮食偏辛辣，积习数千年，至今依然。正是这种地域自然条件和由此决定的人们的饮食习俗，使得巴蜀人首先“煎茶”服用以除瘴气，解热毒。久服成习，药用之旨逐渐隐没，茶于是成了一种日常饮料。秦人入巴蜀时，见到的可能就是这种作为日常饮料的饮茶习俗。\n茶由药用转化为习常饮料，严格意义的“茶”便随之产生了，其典型标志便是“茶”（cha）音的出现。郭璞注《尔雅·释木》“槚”云：“树小如栀子，冬生叶，可煮作羹饮。今呼早采者为茶，晚取者为茗，一名荈，蜀人名之苦荼。”可见，汉时“荼”字已有特指饮料“茶”的读音了，“茶”由“荼”分离出来，并走上了“独立”发展道路。但“茶”字的出现则是伴随茶事的发展和商业活动的日益频繁，直到中唐以后的事，也正符合新符号的产生后于人们的社会生活这样一种文字变化的规律。\n中国从何时开始饮茶，众说不一，西汉时已有饮茶之事的正式文献记载，饮茶的起始时间当比这更早一些。茶以文化面貌出现，是在汉魏两晋南北朝时期。\n茶文化从广义上讲，分茶的自然科学和茶的人文科学两方面，是指人类社会历史实践过程中所创造的与茶有关的物质财富和精神财富的总和。从狭义上讲，着重于茶的人文科学，主要指茶对精神和社会的功能。由于茶的自然科学已形成独立的体系，因而，常讲的茶文化偏重于人文科学。\n\n### 三国以前茶文化\n\n很多书籍把茶的发现时间定为公元前2737-2697年，其历史可推到三皇五帝。东汉华佗《食经》中：“苦茶久食，益意思”记录了茶的医学价值。西汉已将茶的产地县命名为“荼陵”，即湖南的茶陵。\n\n### 晋代茶文化\n\n随着文人饮茶之兴起，有关茶的诗词歌赋日渐问世，茶已经脱离作为一般形态的饮食走入文化圈，起着一定的精神、社会作用。两晋南北朝时期，门阀制度业已形成，不仅帝王、贵族聚敛成风，一般官吏乃至士人皆以夸豪斗富为荣，多效膏梁厚味。在此情况下，一些有识之士提出“养廉”的问题。于是，出现了陆纳、桓温以茶代酒之举。南齐世祖武皇帝是个比较开明的帝王，他不喜游宴，死前下遗诏，说他死后丧礼要尽量节俭，不要以三牲为祭品，只放些干饭、果饼和茶饭便可以。并要“天下贵贱，咸同此制。”在陆纳、桓温、齐武帝那里，饮茶不仅为了提神解渴，它开始产生社会功以有，成为以茶待客、用以祭祀并表示一种精神、情操的手段。饮茶已不完全是以其自然使用使用价值为人所用，而是进入了精神领域。\n魏晋南北朝时期，天下骚乱，各种文化思想交融碰撞，玄学相当流行。玄学是魏晋时期一种哲学思潮，主要是以老庄思想糅合儒家经义。玄学家大都是所谓名士，重视门第、容貌、仪止，爱好虚无玄远的清谈。东晋、南朝时，江南的富庶使士人得到暂时的满足，终日流连于青山秀水之间，清淡之风继续发展，以致出现许多清谈家。最初有清谈家多酒徒，后来，清谈之风渐渐发展到一般文人。玄学家喜演讲，普通清谈者也喜高谈阔论。酒能使人兴奋，但喝了多了便会举止失措、胡言乱语，有失雅观。而茶则可竟日长饮而始终清醒，令人思路清晰，心态平和。况且，对一般文人来讲，整天与酒肉打交道，经济条件也不允许。于是，许多玄学家、清谈家从好酒转向好茶。在他们那里，饮茶已经被当作精神现象来对待。\n随着佛教传入、道教兴起，饮茶已与佛、道教联系起来。在道家看来，茶是帮助炼“内丹”，升清降浊，轻身换骨，修成长生不老之体的好办法；在佛家看来，茶又是禅定入静的必备之物。尽管此时尚未形成完整的宗教饮茶仪式和阐明茶的思想原理，但茶已经脱离作为饮食的物态形式，具有显著的社会、文化功能，中国茶文化初见端倪。\n\n### 隋唐茶文化\n\n根据茶在先前都是药用，在隋朝全民普遍饮茶，也多是认为对身体有益。隋朝基本是初步形成中国茶文化，公元780年，陆羽据此著《茶经》，是隋、唐茶文化形成的专有标志。其概括了茶的自然和人文科学双重内容，探讨了饮茶艺术，把儒、道、佛三教融入饮茶中，创新了中国茶道精神。以后又出现大量茶书、茶诗，有《茶述》、《煎茶水记》、《采茶记》、《十六汤品》等。唐代茶文化的形成与禅教的兴起有关，因茶有提神益思，生津止渴功能，故寺庙崇尚饮茶，在寺院周围植茶树，制定茶礼、设茶堂、选茶头，专呈茶事活动。在唐代形成的中国茶道分宫廷茶道、寺院茶礼、文人茶道。\n\n### 宋代茶文化\n\n宋代茶业已有很大发展，推动了茶叶文化的发展，在文人中出现了专业品茶社团，有官员组成的“汤社”、佛教徒的“千人社”等。宋太祖赵匡胤是位嗜茶之士，在宫廷中设立茶事机关，宫廷用茶已分等级。茶仪已成礼制，赐茶已成皇帝笼络大臣、眷怀亲族的重要手段，还赐给国外使节。至于下层社会，茶文化更是生机活泼，有人迁徙，邻里要“献茶”、有客来，要敬“元宝茶”，定婚时要“下茶”，结婚时要“定茶”，同房时要“合茶”。民间斗茶风起，带来了采制烹点的一系列变化。\n自元代以后，茶文化进入了曲折发展期。宋人拓展了茶文化的社会层面和文化形式，茶事十分兴旺，但茶艺走向繁复、琐碎、奢侈，失去了唐代茶文化深刻的思想内涵，过于精细的茶艺淹没了茶文化的精神，失去了其高洁深邃的本质。在朝廷、贵族、文人那里，喝茶成了“喝礼儿”、“喝气派”、“玩茶”。\n元代，一方面，北方少数民族虽也喜欢茶，但主要是出于生活、生理上的需要，从文化上却对品茶煮茗之事举趣不大；另一方面，中国文化人面对故国破碎，异族压迫，也无心再以茶事表现自己的风流倜傥，而希望通过饮茶表现自己的情操，磨砺自己的意志。这两股不同的思想潮流，在茶文化中契合后，促进了茶艺向简约、返璞归真方向发展。明代中叶以前，汉人有感于前代民族举亡，本趄一开国便国事艰难，于是仍怀砺节之志。茶文化仍承元代势，表现为茶艺简约化，茶文化精糖果与自然契合，以茶表现自己的苦节。\n\n### 明清茶文化\n\n此时已出现蒸青、炒青、烘青等各茶类，茶的饮用已改成“撮泡法”，明代不少文人雅士留有传世之作，如唐伯虎的《烹茶画卷》、《品茶图》，文征明的《惠山茶会记》、《陆羽烹茶图》、《品茶图》等。茶类的增多，泡茶的技艺有别，茶具的款式、质地、花纹千姿百态。到清朝茶叶出口已成一种正式行业，茶书、茶事、茶诗不计其数。\n\n### 现代的发展\n\n新中国成立后，中国茶叶从1949的年产7500T发展到1998年的60余万T。茶物质财富的大量增加为中国茶文化的发展提供了坚实的基础，1982年，在杭州成立了第一个以宏扬茶文化为宗旨的社会团体--“茶人之家”，1983年湖北成立“陆羽茶文化研究会”，1990年“中国茶人联谊会”在北京成立，1993年“中国国际茶文化研究会”在湖洲成立，1991年中国茶叶博物馆在杭州西湖乡正式开放。1998年中国国际和平茶文化交流馆建成。随着茶文化的兴起，各地茶艺馆越办越多。国际茶文化研讨会已开到第五，各省各市及主产茶县纷纷主办“茶叶节”，如福建武夷市的岩茶节、云南的普洱茶节，浙江新昌、泰顺、湖北英山、河南信阳的茶叶节不胜枚举。都以茶为载体，促进全面的经济贸易发展。\n2022年，中国传统制茶技艺及其相关习俗申遗成功。\n\n## 饮茶功效\n\n茶有健身、治疾之药物疗效，又富欣赏情趣，可陶冶情操。品茶、待客是中国人高雅的娱乐和社交活动，坐茶馆、茶话会则是中国人社会性群体茶艺活动。\n茶叶冲以煮沸的清水，顺乎自然，清饮雅尝，寻求茶的固有之味，重在意境，这是茶的中式品茶的特点。同样质量的茶叶，如用水不同、茶具不同或冲泡技术不一，泡出的茶汤会有不同的效果。中国自古以来就十分讲究茶的冲泡，积累了丰富的经验。泡好茶，要了解各类茶叶的特点，掌握科学的冲泡技术，使茶叶的固有品质能充分地表现出来。\n\n## 茶文化特性\n\n### 历史性\n\n茶文化的形成和发展其历史非常悠久。武王伐纣，茶叶已作为贡品。原始公社后期，茶叶成为货物交换的物品。战国，茶叶已有一定规模。先秦《诗经》总集有茶的记载。\n汉朝 ，茶叶成为佛教“坐禅”的专用滋补品。魏晋南北朝，已有饮茶之风。隋朝，全民普遍饮茶。唐代，茶业昌盛，茶叶成为“人家不可一日无茶”，出现茶馆、茶宴、茶会，提倡客来敬茶。宋朝、流行斗茶，贡茶和赐茶。\n清朝，曲艺进入茶馆，茶叶对外贸易发展。茶文化是伴随商品经济的出现和城市文化的形成而孕育诞生的。历史上的茶文化注重文化意识形态，以雅为主，着重于表现诗词书画、品茗歌舞。茶文化在形成和发展中，融合了儒家思想，道家和释家的哲学色泽，并演变为各民族的礼俗，成为优秀传统文化的组成部分和独具特色的一种文化模式。\n\n### 时代性\n\n物质文明和精神文明建设的发展，给茶文化注入 了新的内涵和活力，茶文化内涵及表现形式正在不断扩大、延伸、创新和发展。新时期茶文化溶进现代科学技术、现代新闻媒体和市场经济精髓，使茶文化价值功能更加显著、对现代化社会 的作用进一步增强。茶的价值是茶文化核心的意识进一步确立，国际交往日益频繁。新时期茶文化传播方式形式，呈大型化、现代化、社 会化和国际化趋势。其内涵迅速膨胀，影响扩大，为世人瞩目。\n\n### 地区性\n\n名茶、名山、名水、名人、名胜、孕育出各具特色的地 区茶文化。中国地区广阔，茶类花色繁多，饮茶习俗各异，加之各地 历史、文化、生活及经济差异，形成各具地方特色的茶文化。在经济 、文化中心的大城市，以其独特的自身优势和丰富的内涵，也形成独 具特色的都市茶文化。上海自1994年起，已连续举办四届国际茶文化 节，显示出都市茶文化的特点与魅力。\n\n### 国际性\n\n古老的中国传统茶文化同各国的历史、文化、经济及人 文相结合，中国茶文化是各国茶文化的摇篮。演变成英国茶文化、日本茶文化、韩国茶文化、俄罗斯茶 文化及摩洛哥茶文化等。在英国，饮茶成为生活一部分，是英国人表现绅士风格的一种礼仪，也是英国女王生活中必不可少的程序和重大社会活动中必需的仪程。日本茶道源于中国。日本茶道具有浓郁的日本民族风情，并形成独特的茶道体系、流派和礼仪。\n中国茶的历史及其发展，不仅仅是形成简单的一种饮食文化的过程，而同样映射出一个具有上下五千年历史的民族的精神特质。\n专访阿根廷中国茶文化协会会长上官碧旺：\n\n上官碧旺（右）与阿根廷侨领黄其兴做客华人头条 抓住中国街的商机味蕾\n\n## 内容涵盖\n\n中国茶文化的内容主要是茶在中国精神文化中的体现，这比“茶风俗”、“茶道”的范畴深广的多，也是中国茶文化之所以与欧美或日本的茶文化的分别很大的原因。中国茶文化的内容涵盖：\n中国的茶书\n中国各地区的茶俗\n茶具艺术\n茶水选择\n茶汤冲泡\n名茶典故\n不包括茶叶种植、科技等。\n\n## 茶文化的功用\n\n茶文化是中华文化教育的重要组成部分，历史悠久，内涵丰富，对社会文明进步与经济发展作用很大。在二十一世纪经济快速发展的时候，如何进一步弘扬茶文化，发挥茶文化在大茶业中的积极作用，也是值得考虑的重要问题。\n一、历史的回顾\n1．说起茶的发现，人们会自然地想到神农尝百草的传说，然而把茶作为饮料、作为一种精神享受，真正有历史记载的还应该从西汉算起，王褒《僮约》中“烹茶尽具”、武阳买茶和记载，充分证明了当时饮茶风俗的形成和茶叶市场的存在。东晋常璩在《华阳国志.巴志》中记述了巴蜀地共的很多共梧甚至把茶作为贡品。魏晋南北朝时一些有识之士“以茶养谦”巳成风气，如晋吴兴太守陆纳已养成只招待茶水的习惯，客来敬茶这也许是最好的例证。\n2．唐代是历史上比较兴旺的朝代，陆羽《茶经》系统总结了唐代及其发前的茶叶生产、饮用的经验，也提出了精行俭德的茶道精神。陆羽及其同时代的一些文人，都非常重视饮茶的精神享受和道德规范，而且非常讲究饮茶用具和煮茶的艺术，可以说中国的茶道、茶艺从此产生。当时比屋皆饮的民间茶俗，乃至豪华隆重的皇室宫廷茶宴，以及文人的茶诗词与茶书画，都是茶文化形成与发展的集中表现。\n3．到了宋代，茶叶生产进一步发展，饮茶更加普及，作为贡品的建州龙团凤饼更是花样翻新。宋徽宗皇帝赵佶著《大观茶论》，这是中国历史上唯一的一位亲自写茶书的皇帝。跟随其后的不少文人雅士也纷纷写诗作茶画。同时饮茶艺术也有了进一步的发展，“点茶”技艺进一步规范，“斗茶”之风盛行，佛门茶事兴旺，饮茶技艺也随着佛教的传播而迅速走也国门传至海内外。\n4．明清时代散叶茶迅速发展，多茶类的结构逐步形成，饮茶方法也从点茶发展成泡茶，而且泡茶用具也越来越讲究，工艺精巧的紫砂壶、盖碗瓷器茶具等也应运而生。客来敬茶、以茶待客风气更为普及，都市茶馆林立，利用茶馆休闲、谈生意已是平常事，茶馆文化教育得到发展。\n二、中华茶文化的内涵、形式和社会功能\n1．中华民族在历史的长河中，不断改造自然创造物质财富的同时，也创造了光辉灿烂的文化，为世界人类的进步和发展作出了巨大的贡献，意义十分深远。茶文化是中华文化教育的一个重要组成部分，它的内涵极其丰富，包含着茶叶生产消费及其对人的精神生活产生影响的各个方面。 2．茶文化教育的表现及存形式，既有物质形态的，也有精神形态的。表现为物质形态的，诸如茶的历史文物、遗迹、茶书、茶画、各种名优茶、茶馆、茶具、茶歌舞和茶艺表演等等。表现为精神形态的，诸如茶德、茶道精神、以茶待客、以茶养廉、以茶养性等等。\n3．由于茶文化的内涵极其丰富，既是物质的，也是精神的，因此中华茶文化在发展的过程中所发挥的社会功能和作用也必然是多方面的。传统的茶文化与人们社会生活的关系，向来就是非常密切的，无论是历史文人生活中的“琴棋书画酒诗茶”，还是平民百姓生活中的“柴米油盐酱醋茶”，茶都是不可缺少的。茶文化发展至现代，茶的社会功能更加突出，归纳其重要方面大致有21项：以茶会友、以茶联谊、以茶示礼、以茶代酒、以茶倡廉、以茶表德、以茶为模、以茶养性、以茶为媒、以茶祭祀 、以茶作禅、以茶作诗、以茶作画、以茶歌舞、以茶献艺、以茶旅游、以茶做菜、以茶为食、以茶设宴、以茶健身、以茶制药。\n以茶会友：客来敬茶向来是中华民族的优良传统。朋友相见，饮茶叙事，新切祥和。\n以茶联谊：各种联谊活动，采用茶话会的形式，既庄重又生动活泼。\n以茶示礼：亲友相见、人际交往，无论是多么庄重的高级会谈或是重要会议，每人清茶一杯，显示了一种尊敬的礼仪。现代社会以工为礼品者显得高尚。\n以茶代酒：从古至今，以茶代酒者不乏其人，现代人际交往，提倡以茶代酒，实在是高尚之举。\n以茶倡廉：清茶一杯，以示清正廉洁，是反对铺张浪费，提倡清廉的重要举措。\n以茶表德：日本千利休茶道精神是“和敬清寂”，中国当代茶人著名茶学专家庄晚芳先生提倡的中国茶德是“廉美和敬”。\n以茶为模：以茶的奉献精神为模，倡导做一个正直清廉的“茶人”。\n以茶养性：从古至今不少文人雅士都提倡以茶修心养性，提高人们的道德水准。\n以茶为媒：中国历史上茶与婚姻关系密切，以茶联姻、婚嫁用茶的传统流传至今已成习俗。\n以茶祭祀：中国民间的丧祭活动，很多仍流传用茶作祭品的习惯。\n以茶作禅：自古就有“茶禅一味”之说，寺院茶道的禅茶、普茶、施茶等都是以茶悟道的重要仪式。\n以茶作诗：历代诗人作茶诗者很多，内容广泛，形式多样。\n以茶作画：历代描绘茶会、烹茶、饮茶等内容的书画较多，艺术价值较高。\n以茶歌舞：以采茶、饮茶等内容的歌舞较多，生动活泼。\n以茶献艺：各种流派的茶艺表演具有欣赏价值，不少茶类、地区、民族的饮茶习俗，艺术化以后，具有较强的感染力。\n以茶旅游：茶乡旅游是现代旅游业中的特色旅游项目，游名山、观名寺、饮名茶三位一体，很受欢迎。\n以茶做菜：很多少数民族地区都有以鲜茶做菜的习俗，茶文化活动频繁之地，以茶作菜的菜谱也是丰富多彩的。\n以茶为食：将茶添加于食品饮料中食用，逐渐流行起来，茶叶口香糖、茶叶蛋糕、茶叶面条、茶酒等都已被人们接受。\n以茶设宴：各地的早茶、夜茶，以饮茶与吃小点心结合的方式，受到普遍欢迎。\n以茶健身：已知茶对人体健康具有多种功效，饮茶健身是很多饮茶爱好者的切身体会。\n以茶制药：将茶叶中具有药效功能的物质分离提取出来，制成防病治病的药物，这是茶对人类健康的新贡献。\n综合上述茶的主要社会功能，可以认为，茶对社会生活和社会发展的影响是很大的其影响归纳起来有如下几点：\n1．以茶会友，以茶联谊，客来敬茶，以茶示礼，提倡“和主贵阳市”，双月刊一步增进友谊，调节社会人际关系。\n2．以茶代酒、以茶倡廉，提倡茶德和茶人精神，以茶养性，能担提高人们的思想水平，促进社会的精神文明建设。\n3．经茶主媒、以茶祭祀、茶禅结合，发挥茶的媒介作用和精神寄托作用。\n4．以茶作诗作画，以茶歌舞，经茶献艺，茶乡旅游，倡导高雅的艺术享受，美化人们和生活。\n5．经茶做菜，以茶曾食，以茶设宴，提倡茶为国饮，丰富人们的饮食生活。\n6．饮茶健身，以茶制药，发挥茶的保健功效，提高人们的健康水平。\n7．弘扬茶文化，促进社会进步和21世纪茶业的发展。\n弘扬茶文化的总体目的是为人类社会的文明与进步作出作出贡献。具体到茶行业本身，弘扬茶文化应该是促进茶业事业的发展。因此在即将进入21世纪的时候，弘扬中华茶文化，其目标是：促进茶叶消费增长，有益人类心身健康，推动精神文明建设。围绕这个目标，当前及下个世纪初应该开展的工作主要是下列几个方面：\n1．挖掘和整理茶叶史料，建立中华茶文化宝库\n几千年的茶叶发展史，历代茶人著书立说，积累下来的茶叶历史资料是很多的，包括茶书、茶诗词、茶书法、茶画、茶歌茶舞、茶的历史文献、地方志中有关茶的记载等，内容非常广泛。如能下力气花工夫把它们整理出来，这将是中华茶文化教育的重要宝库，也是弘扬茶文化必需做好的一项重要工作。\n2．发现和保护中华茶文化教育的历史遗迹，发展茶文化旅游事业\n中国茶区辽阔、历史悠久，各地有待挖掘和保护的与茶有关的历史遗迹很多，如摩崖石刻、建筑、古墓、器具、碑、亭、井、园、树等，凡有保存价值的，都应力求保护好、管理好。而且有条件的地方可以配套发展茶文化旅游事业，既可扩大宣传，又可增加经济收入。\n3．充分发挥各种媒体的宣传作用，普及茶文化知识\n弘扬茶文化，不应只局限于茶界与文化界的小圈子，而应该利用各种媒体广为宣传，使更多的饮茶爱好者和消费者不断增长茶文化的知识更新，从而促进茶叶消费。\n4．倡导茶人茶德精神，促进精神文明建设\n中国的茶人精神和茶德精神，究竟应归纳为那必个字或那几句话，还没有统一的说法。陆羽提出的“精行俭德”，庄晚芳提倡的“廉美和敬”，笔者曾建议和“理敬清融”。虽然提法各有侧重，但基本精神是一致的。我们应该发扬这些茶人、茶德精神，净化人们的思想意识，提高道德水准，促进精神文明建设的发展。\n5．恢复和发展历史名茶，丰富茶叶产品市场\n恢复和发展历史名茶的工作，各地已经广泛开展，这项工作必须依据市场经济的规律，不要片面追求高精尖，不要一律只采单芽茶，而是要面向大众消费，创立名牌，把高质量高效益作为追求的目标。\n6．培训和规范茶艺茶道，引导茶艺馆健康发展\n中国各地饮茶技艺不尽相同。各地涌现出来的各种茶馆和茶艺馆如雨后春笋，档次虽有差别，但都应该以满足各种消费群体的正当需求为目标，因此引导消费者如何科学地泡好一壶（杯）茶，如何欣赏饮用它，充分发挥茶的饮用价值，这是我们工作的重点。至于茶道茶艺表演，作为一种艺术形式，可以规范可以保留，但不要提倡都得这样慢吞吞地去饮茶。中国老百姓长期沿用匠随和的饮茶方式仍然是属于老百姓自己的最好方式。\n7．扩大国际茶文化交流活动，增进友谊，促进茶叶贸易的发展\n中华茶文化不仅是中国人的传统文化，而且已经对世界茶文化产生了积极的影响。进一步扩大国际茶文化教育交流活动，有利于增进友谊、促进和平事业的发展，也有利于更多的国际友人了解中国多种多样的茶叶产品，促进国际茶叶贸易的发展。 8．加强茶与健康的科学研究，促进茶叶消费\n饮茶有利于健康，这是人们的共知。但是茶的保健功能究竟有多大，如何正确、科学地饮用才能达到吩的效果，不同消费者，身体状况不同，如何选用茶叶等等，都有待于加强科学研究。只有把这些通过研究获得的科学知识，通过各种渠道普及到普通消费者，才能真正促进茶叶消费。\n中华茶文化博大精深，充分发挥它的功能与作用，必将促进茶业事业的发展，促进人类的文明与进步，对社会发展作出积极的贡献。\n\n## 茶与礼节\n\n中国是茶叶的故乡，有着悠久的种茶历史，严格的敬茶礼节，奇特的饮茶风俗。中国饮茶，从神农时代开始，有四千七百多年历史。茶礼有缘，古已有之。客来敬茶，是中国汉族最早重情好客的传统美德与礼节。直到21世纪，宾客至家，总要沏上一杯香茗。喜庆活动，也喜用茶点招待。开个茶话会，既简便经济，又典雅庄重。所谓君子之交淡如水，也是指清香宜人的茶水。汉族还有种种以茶代礼的风俗。南宋都城杭州，每逢立夏，家家各烹新茶，并配以各色细果，馈送亲友毗邻，叫做七家茶。这种风俗，就是在茶杯内放两颗青果即橄榄或金桔，表示新春吉祥如意的意思。\n\n茶礼还是中国古代婚礼中一种隆重的礼节。明·许次纾在《茶疏考本》中说：茶不移本，植必子生。古人结婚以茶为识，以为茶树只能从种子萌芽成株，不能移植，否则就会枯死，因此把茶看作是一种至性不移的象征。所以，民间男女订婚以茶为礼，女方接受男方聘礼，叫下茶或茶定，有的叫受茶，并有一家不吃两家茶的谚语。同时，还把整个婚姻的礼仪总称为三茶六礼。三茶，就是订婚时的下茶，结婚的定茶，同房时的合茶。下茶又有男茶女酒之称，即定婚时，男家除送如意压帖外，要回送几缸绍兴酒。婚礼时，还要行三道茶仪式。三道茶者，第一杯百果，第二杯莲子、枣儿；第三杯方是茶。吃的方式，接杯之后，双手捧之，深深作揖，然后向嘴唇一触，即由家人收去。第二道亦如此。第三道，作揖后才可饮。这是最尊敬的礼仪。这些繁俗，有婚礼的敬茶之礼，仍沿用成习。张源《茶录》“汤辨”条载：“汤有三大辨十五辨。一曰形辨，二曰声辨，三曰气辨。\n\n## 茶与艺术\n\n自古以来，种茶、制茶、泡茶、品茶均被认为需要高度技艺。当代，由中国人开始，将有关的技艺称为茶艺。同时，历朝历代也涌现出大量与茶有关的各种艺术作品。\n茶之为物，产自崇高的山，吸收天地的灵气，还必须配上清洁的流泉。所谓仁者爱山，智者爱水；古人的一杯茶包含中国文人、哲人深爱的天、地、山、水，仁、智。\n\n## 茶与文学\n\n中国关于茶的文学作品不胜枚举，仅古诗词一项，总数在2000首以上.\n有关资料显示最早的关于茶的文学作品是杜育的《荈赋》。\n唐代著名诗人白居易的2800部诗歌作品中，与茶有关的有60首。而他本人也是品茶行家，一天到晚茶不离口。\n唐代诗人卢仝所作《走笔谢孟谏议寄新茶》脍炙人口，历久不衰\n“一碗喉吻润，二碗破孤闷。三碗搜枯肠，惟有文字五千卷。四碗发轻汗，平生不平事，尽向毛孔散。五碗肌骨清，六碗通仙灵。七碗吃不得也，唯觉两腋习习清风生。”\n北宋范仲淹作《斗茶歌》描绘了茶文化在当时的盛行。\n北宋·苏轼《汲江煎茶》描写诗人在月明之夜亲自用大瓢汲取活江水烹茶的情景：\n“活水还须活火煮，自临钓石取深清。大瓢贮月归春瓮，小杓分江入夜瓶。\n雪乳已翻煎处脚，松风忽作泻时声。枯肠未易禁三碗，坐听荒城长短更。 ”\n散文\n关于茶的散文、小品文、书信等很多，著名的有\n柳宗元《为武中丞谢赐新茶表》\n刘禹锡《代武中丞谢赐新茶表》\n吕温《三月三日花宴序》\n皮日休《茶中杂咏序》\n苏东坡《叶嘉传》\n唐庚《斗茶记》\n张岱《闽老子茶》\n张岱《阳和泉》\n张潮《中冷泉记》。扬子江金山寺的中冷泉历来有名。清代著名小品文作家张潮生动地描写了自古到金山寺吸中冷的僧侣、道士胸中皆带仙气。金山寺上有一口中冷泉井，有瓦亭覆盖，盘龙石栏，寺僧纷纷汲水，为当时来到烧香拜神的几万香客备茶。那根本不是真正的中冷泉。一位道士带领张潮攀登嶙嶙的乱石，到山顶看见一面石壁，刮去青苔，露出几行字，说真正的中冷泉，在郭璞墓间，必须在子午两个时辰，用特制的铜瓶，用长索拴住，放下郭璞墓间的石窟中汲取。张潮跟随道人答乘夜行船，两天后到了闰州。午夜，小舟直奔郭璞墓，在江心石堆中，有一个黑洞洞的石窟，道人大喊“这就是中冷窟。”\n\n## 其它艺术作品\n\n### 书法\n\n著名的茶帖有：\n唐怀素《苦笋帖》\n宋苏轼 啜茶帖\n宋《季常帖》《新岁展庆帖》\n宋蔡襄《精茶帖》 、《天际乌云帖》\n宋米芾《笤溪帖》\n宋赵令畴《赐茶帖》\n清金农《玉川子嗜茶帖》\n\n### 茶画\n\n著名的茶画：\n唐阎立本萧翼赚兰亭图唐阎立本 《萧翼赚兰亭图》。大画家阎立本根据唐何延之《兰亭记》所作。描绘唐太宗御史萧翼从王羲之第七代传人的第子袁辩才的手中将“天下第一行书”《兰亭集序》骗取到手献给唐太宗的故事。画的是萧翼和袁辩才在喝茶，萧翼洋洋得意，老和尚辩才张口结舌，失神落魄，人物表情刻画入微。\n唐周昉调琴啜茗图唐周昉《调琴啜茗图》\n元赵元《陆羽品茶图》\n元赵孟𫖯《斗茶图》、《茶榜》\n元倪云林《龙门茶屋图》\n元颜辉《煮茶图》\n元胡廷

综述\n\n茶的主要味道来自茶叶，因此茶叶对茶的品质影响也是最大的。\n中国在很长的历史时期都是主要的茶叶出产地，因此茶叶的品种也特别多。其中有名的品种更是不少，下面所列出的仅是其中较有代表性的几种。\n\n### 绿茶类\n\n毛尖：产于河南信阳 俗称“绿茶之王”。\n龙井：既是浙江省杭州地名，也是泉名。此地出产的茶亦用此名。\n碧螺春：产于江苏省吴县洞庭山。茶叶采于春季，制成品紧密缠绕，带螺旋形。相传康熙年间，洞庭山少女采茶，不带筐子，把茶叶放在乳间，茶得体温而生奇香，名为“吓杀人”茶。清康熙皇帝南巡太湖，喜爱这茶的清香，但认为“吓杀人”不雅，又因为茶叶带螺旋形，康熙皇帝赐名碧螺春。碧螺春成为清代贡茶。\n毛峰：产于安徽省黄山。\n剑毫：产于安徽省潜山县天柱山（大别山区）。\n猴魁：产于安徽省太平县。\n瓜片:产于安徽省六安县。\n珠茶：产于浙江平水。\n青顶：产于浙江临安天目山。\n白云茶：产于浙江雁荡山。\n银毫茶：产于湖南百叠岭。\n\n### 红茶类\n\n正山小种：又称拉普山小种，属红茶类，与人工小种合称为小种红茶。首次种植于福建省崇安县（1989崇安撤县设市，更名为武夷山市）桐木地区。是世界上最早的红茶，亦称红茶鼻祖，至今已经有400多年的历史，由福建武夷山深处当地茶农于明朝中后期机缘之下创制而成。后来在正山小种的基础上发展了工夫红茶。历史上该茶以星村为集散地，故又称星村小种。\n川红：川红工夫产于四川省宜宾等地，具备紧细圆直，毫锋披露，色泽乌润，内质香高味浓的优良品质。\n祁门红茶：简称祁红，产于安徽省祁门。\n滇红：云南红茶，简称滇红。\n暖卡红茶：产于河南信阳。温胃暖身，抗御寒冷，索住热量。\n信阳红：产于河南信阳。\n北苑贡茶：产于福建省建瓯市。\n\n### 乌龙茶类\n\n铁观音：产于福建省安溪。\n黄金桂：产于福建省安溪。\n毛蟹：产于福建省安溪。\n本山：产于福建省安溪。\n冻顶乌龙：产于台湾冻顶山。\n大红袍： 福建省武夷山\n单枞：广东省潮州市凤凰镇凤凰山\n\n### 黄茶类\n\n蒙顶黄芽：茶芽条匀整，扁平挺直，色泽黄润，金毫显露；汤色黄中透碧，甜香鲜嫩，甘醇鲜爽。为黄茶之极品。\n君山银针:产于湖南洞庭湖君山岛。\n白茶类：产于福建福鼎\n松溪白茶：产于福建松溪县。\n黑茶类： 产于湖南安化\n普洱茶：产于云南\n\n## 泉水\n\n中国历代对泡茶的水十分讲究，认为水是茶之本。\n(明)张大复在《梅花草堂笔谈》中写道“茶性必发于水。八分之水遇十分之茶，茶亦十分。八分之水，试茶十分，茶只得八分。”\n乾隆帝曾说：“茗饮之本，其必资于水乎。”。乾隆特制银斗，品试全国的泉水，按水的质量分别高下：济南趵突泉第一，中冷泉第二，无锡惠泉第三，杭州虎跑泉第四。（乾隆：《天下第一泉记》）\n茶圣陆羽不但是品茶高手，也是品泉高手。\n\n## 泉水种类\n\n### 天泉\n\n雨水明代文人讲究用天水,他们对于春、夏、秋、冬四季的天泉，有不同的评价。秋天的雨水烹茶最好、其次是梅雨季节的雨水，再次是春雨，而夏季多暴雨，水质最差，不主张用来烹茶。收集雨水时必须用干净的白布，在天井中央收雨水。至于从房檐流下的雨水，不能用。\n\n### 雪水\n\n“瑞雪丰年”，古人认为雨水是五谷的精华，用来烹茶最雅。唐代诗人白居易有诗云：“闲尝雪水茶”。\n\n### 露水\n\n又名“天酒”，古代神仙的饮料，《山海经》写道：“仙丘降露，仙人常饮之”。中国历代皇帝王中乾隆最讲究露水。乾隆帝夏天常到承德避暑山庄避暑，喜欢收集太平湖中荷叶上的露水烹茶，认为胜过北京的玉泉山泉水。\n\n### 地泉\n\n各朝代对于中国各地的名泉，排名次序略有不同：\n唐代：\n杨子江金山寺中冷泉\n无锡惠山寺泉\n苏州虎丘寺泉。\n明代\n无锡惠山寺泉\n金山寺中冷泉\n杭州虎跑泉\n清代\n北京玉泉山\n杨子江金山寺中冷泉\n无锡惠泉\n\n## 茶具\n\n茶具，古代亦称茶器或茗器。茶具是所有泡茶过程中必备的器具，不单指茶壶、茶杯，被认为对茶的品质有着莫大的影响。\n明太祖第十七子朱权所著的《茶谱》中列出10种茶具，这还是比较少的了：\n茶炉、茶灶、茶磨、茶碾、茶罗、茶架、茶匙、茶筅、茶瓯、茶瓶。\n最早的茶壶使用金、银、玉等材料制成。唐宋以来，由于陶瓷工艺的兴起，逐渐被铜和陶瓷茶具代替。铜茶具相对金玉来说，价格更便宜，煮水性能更好，陶瓷茶具盛茶又能保持香气，更重要的是价格相对较低，所以容易推广，又受大众喜爱。\n陕西省扶风县法门寺博物馆保存着一套完整的唐朝皇帝用的纯金茶具。\n宋代湖南长沙出产的茶具，十分精美，价值以白金计算。赵南仲曾出黄金千两定制一副茶具具献给皇上。\n各种茶壶明代供春、时大彬手制的紫砂壶更成为昂贵的艺术品。\n\n## 茶与养生\n\n《神农本草经》记载，神农尝百草，日遇七十毒，得荼而解。荼就是茶的古字（英文 tea 读音来自荼）。茶最早的功用就是药用。\n唐大中三年(850年)有一位和尚130岁，宣宗皇帝问他服什么药才能如此长寿。和尚答道：“我向来不知药性，平生只爱喝茶，每逢云游到一个地方，先讨茶喝，喝一百碗也不嫌多。”皇帝赐和尚五十斤上等茶。\n明高濂的养生经典《遵生八笺》中写道：“人饮真茶，能止渴消食，除痰少睡，利水道，明目益思，除烦去腻，人固不可一日无茶。”\n\n## 茶俗\n\n泡茶\n中国人饮茶的习惯，从唐、宋、明、清到现代，有很大的变化。\n唐代\n唐朝时的茶叶多加工成茶饼。唐朝人不“饮茶”，而是“吃茶”。备茶过程如下：\n将茶饼用火灸烤。\n将烤茶饼放入铜制茶辗辗成颗粒。\n用茶罗筛茶粒取细末。\n为了改善茶叶苦涩味，常加入薄荷、盐、红枣或姜片调味，并多外加龙脑等香料。\n将细茶末连同上列材料，调和成酱。\n然后用茶酱配合其他其食物食用。\n湖南还多少保留“吃茶”的习惯——吃茶叶。毛泽东嗜好吃茶叶。茶叶传入英国时，英国人将开水泡好的茶叶夹入面包片食用。\n宋代\n“茶兴于唐而盛于宋”，在宋代，茶品越来越丰富，饮茶也日益考究，开始重视茶叶的本身的色香味，调味品逐渐减少。此时，出现了用蒸青法制成的散茶，并趋向以散茶为主，同时烹饮的手续也大为简化。\n明代\n到了明代，饼茶、团茶较少见了，较多以喝散茶为主，烹茶方法亦由过去煎茶为主逐步发展为冲泡为主。\n清代\n到了清代，茶与人们的日常生活紧密结合起来，出现了城市的茶馆，并逐步兴起，成为适合各个社会阶层所需的活动场所，并把茶与曲艺、诗会、戏剧、灯谜等民间文化活动融合起来。普通人家也常以茶水招待客人。\n现代\n根据不同情况（如不同场合的特殊礼节），中国茶有着不同的泡法。例如绿茶比乌龙茶和红茶更加清淡可口，因此需要用较冷的水冲泡。想了解更多此方面内容，请参考和工夫茶。\n\n## 相关研究\n\n中国学者在中国茶文化的研究上有不少成绩，《中国茶文化丛书》1-8册，二千余页内容丰富，是可喜的成果。", "## 中国茶文化\n中国茶文化是中国制茶、饮茶的文化。作为开门七件事（柴米油盐酱醋茶）之一，饮茶在古代中国是非常普遍的。中华茶文化不但包含物质文化层面，还包含深厚的精神文明层次。唐代茶圣陆羽的茶经在历史上吹响了中华茶文化的号角。从此茶的精神渗透了宫廷和社会，深入中国的诗词、绘画、书法、宗教、医学。几千年来中国不但积累了大量关于茶叶种植、生产的物质文化、更积累了丰富的有关茶的精神文化，这就是中国特有的茶文化，属于文化学范畴。\n中国茶文化的内容主要是茶在中国精神文化中的体现，不限于“茶风俗”、“茶仪式”的范畴\n##茶与艺术\n自古以来，种茶、制茶、泡茶、品茶均被认为需要高度技艺。当代，由中国人开始，将有关的技艺称为茶艺。同时，历朝历代也涌现出大量与茶有关的各种艺术作品。\n茶之为物，产自崇高的山，吸收天地的灵气，还必须配上清洁的流泉水。所谓“仁者乐山，智者乐水”；古人的一杯茶水包含中国文人、哲人深爱的天、地、山、水，仁、智。\n###茶与文学\n中国关于茶的文学作品汗牛充栋，仅古诗词一项，总数在2000首以上。文人品茗之时，一旦兴致来了，必定会对此情此景吟咏一番，以遣情怀。现在能看到最早的关于茶的文学作品是杜育的《荈赋》。中唐时期的著名诗人白居易，白居易的2800部诗歌作品中，与茶有关的有60首。而他本人也喜爱品茶，一天到晚茶不离口，在其所作的《睡后茶兴忆杨同州》一诗中便写下了“白瓷瓯甚洁，红炉炭方炽。沫下曲尘香，花浮鱼眼沸”的佳句。唐代诗人卢仝所作《走笔谢孟谏议寄新茶》脍炙人口，历久不衰“一碗喉吻润，二碗破孤闷。三碗搜枯肠，惟有文字五千卷。四碗发轻汗，平生不平事，尽向毛孔散。五碗肌骨清，六碗通仙灵。七碗吃不得也，唯觉两腋习习清风生。”北宋范仲淹作《斗茶歌》描绘了茶文化在当时的盛行。北宋·苏轼《汲江煎茶》描写诗人在月明之夜亲自用大瓢汲取活江水烹茶的情景：“活水还须活火烹，自临钓石汲深清；大瓢贮月归春瓮，小杓分江入夜瓶。雪乳已翻煎处脚，松风忽作泻时声；枯肠未易禁三椀，卧听山城长短更。”\n关于茶的散文、小品文、书信等很多，著名的有柳宗元《为武中丞谢赐新茶表》、刘禹锡《代武中丞谢新茶表》、吕温《三月三日花宴序》、皮日休《茶中杂咏序》、苏东坡《叶嘉传》、唐庚《斗茶记》、张岱《闽老子茶》、张岱《阳和泉》、张潮《中冷泉记》等。其中《中冷泉记》以位于南京扬子江金山寺，有“天下第一泉”之称的中冷泉为题材生动地描写了自古到金山寺吸中冷的僧侣、道士胸中皆带仙气。金山寺上有一口中冷泉井，有瓦亭覆盖，盘龙石栏，寺僧纷纷汲水，为当时来到烧香拜神的几万香客备茶。那根本不是真正的中冷泉。一位道士带领张潮攀登嶙嶙的乱石，到山顶看见一面石壁，刮去青苔，露出几行字，说真正的中冷泉，在郭璞墓间，必须在子午两个时辰，用特制的铜瓶，用长索拴住，放下郭璞墓间的石窟中汲取。张潮跟随道人答乘夜行船，两天后到了闰州。午夜，小舟直奔郭璞墓，在江心石堆中，有一个黑洞洞的石窟，道人大喊“这就是中冷窟！”\n###茶与书法\n以茶为题材的书法作品称为茶帖，著名的茶帖有唐怀素《苦笋帖》，宋苏东坡《啜茶帖》、《季常帖》、《新岁展庆帖》，宋蔡襄《精茶帖》 、《天际乌云帖》，宋米芾《笤溪帖》，宋赵令畴《赐茶帖》、清金农《玉川子嗜茶帖》等。\n###茶画\n茶也是中国画常见的题材，著名的茶画有很多，例如唐阎立本 《萧翼赚兰亭图》是根据唐何延之《兰亭记》所作。描绘唐太宗御史萧翼从王羲之第七代传人的第子袁辩才的手中将“天下第一行书”《兰亭集序》骗取到手献给唐太宗的故事，画的是萧翼和袁辩才在喝茶，萧翼洋洋得意，老和尚辩才张口结舌，失神落魄，人物表情刻画入微。明文征明 《惠山茶会图》描绘文征明和几位诗友在有“天下第二泉”之称的无锡惠山泉品茗。二人在茶亭泉井边席地而坐，文征明展卷颂诗，友人在聆听；古松下一茶童备茶，茶灶正煮井水，茶几上放着各种茶具。中国文人至爱的高山、流泉、古松、友谊，尽在以茶会友中。\n还有唐周昉《调琴啜茗图》，唐人《宫乐图》，北宋赵佶（宋徽宗）《文会图》，元赵元《陆羽品茶图》，元赵孟𫖯《斗茶图》与《茶榜》，元倪云林《龙门茶屋图》，元颜辉《煮茶图》，元胡廷 《松下烹茶图》，元钱选《卢同煮茶图》、《品茶图》，明丁云鹏《玉川烹茶图》，明唐寅《事茗图》、《卢同煎煮茶》，清胡锡珪《洗砚烹茶图卷》，清高凤翰《天池试茶图》，清高翔《煎茶图》等。\n###采茶相关艺术\n采茶歌是采茶人在采茶所唱的民谣，后来配合采茶水的动作，演变成采茶舞、采茶戏等传统表演艺术形式。\n##茶与禅宗\n唐人饮茶之风，最早始于僧家，“茶禅一味”的典故源自赵州和尚那句著名的偈语——“吃茶去”。赵州和尚即著名的唐代名僧赵州从谂（公元778－897），因常住赵州（今属河北省赵县）观音院（今柏林寺），又称“赵州古佛”，由于其传扬佛教不遗余力，时谓“赵州门风”。他于禅学于茶学都有很高的造诣，《广群芳谱·茶谱》引《指月录》文曰：“有僧到赵州从谂禅师处，僧曰：‘新近曾到此间么？’曰：‘曾到。”师曰：‘吃茶去。”又问僧，僧曰：‘不曾到。”师曰：‘吃茶去。”后院主问曰：‘为甚么曾到也-{zh-hans:云;zh-hant:云;}-吃茶去，不曾到也-{zh-hans:云;zh-hant:云;}-吃茶去？”师召院主，主应诺。师曰：‘吃茶去。’”\n##品饮\n茶的主要味道来自茶叶，因此茶叶对茶的品质影响也是最大的。中国在很长的历史时期是主要的茶叶出产地，因此茶叶的品种也特别多。其中有名的品种更是不少，中国茶依发酵程度可分为绿茶水、红茶水、青茶水、黄茶水、白茶水、黑茶水。\n除了水外，茶叶质也备受重视。\n###茶器\n茶具是所有泡茶过程中必备的器具，不单指茶壶、茶杯，广义的茶具还包括各种备茶、煮茶、贮存茶叶用的器具以至喝茶场所内的家具、陈设。被认为对茶的品质有着莫大的影响。\n宋朝的《茶具图赞》列出了12种茶具。明太祖第十七子朱权所著的《茶谱》中列出10种茶具，包括茶炉 、茶灶 、茶磨、茶碾 、茶罗 、茶架 、茶匙、茶筅 、茶瓯 、茶瓶。\n最早的茶壶使用金、银、玉等材料制成。唐宋以来，由于陶瓷工艺的兴起，逐渐被铜和陶瓷茶具代替。铜茶具相对金玉来说，价格更便宜，煮水性能更好，陶瓷茶具盛茶又能保持香气，更重要的是价格相对较低，所以容易推广，又受大众喜爱。\n宋代湖南长沙出产的茶具，十分精美，价值以白金计算。赵南仲曾出黄金千两定制一副茶具具献给皇帝。陕西省扶风县法门寺博物馆保存着一套完整的唐朝皇帝用的纯金茶具。明代供春、时大彬手制的紫砂壶更成为昂贵的艺术品。\n####茶相关家具、储具与陈设、布置\n茶相关家具、储具有茶几、台子、器局、提篮等，陈设有插花用的花瓶、烧香用的香炉，茶所布置有挂轴等。\n###茶艺\n中国茶艺是一种仪式化的饮茶方式，它把简单的饮茶行为升华成一种美好的艺术享受，使人们在一道道繁杂琐碎的程序之后，能够浅酌慢饮，陶醉于一种恬静、淡泊、忘我的境界，获得物质上和精神上的极大满足和慰藉。\n很多人喜欢这种泡茶和喝茶的艺术，现时许多其他国家的人也热心于中国茶艺。他们不仅喜爱茶的味道，也享受泡茶过程中的乐趣，此外还能放松心灵。\n###茶所\n北京的茶馆是北京的一个特色，老舍曾经有话剧茶馆刻画茶馆里的众生百相。现在在北京前门西，开设了老舍茶馆，里面有一些曲艺节目表演。\n广东茶楼的特色是喝茶时同时吃点心。到茶楼品茗粤语称之为饮茶。\n####茶馆\n茶馆是供人品茶、喝茶的公共场所。中国茶馆在不同地区有不同的名称和风俗，有北京茶馆、四川茶馆、天津茶社、杭州茶室、广州茶楼等等，形成了中国的茶馆文化。\n根据中国古典典籍，最早的茶馆出现在唐朝开元年间（713年－741年），叫茗铺。清代茶馆发展成为大众娱乐场所。京师茶馆，列长茶案，可以自己带茶叶，可以提鸟笼，入座买水。乾隆末年江南有河滨茶馆、卖茶、瓜子、糖果、春卷、烧卖、水饺子。上海茶馆最早出现在同治初年，“丽水台”茶楼，楼高三层。到了光绪丙子上海有了广东茶楼，卖茶和各种小吃，早茶卖鱼生粥，午茶有点心、蒸粉果；夜茶有莲子粥、杏仁露。不久上海还出现东洋茶馆。苏州茶馆、除去喝茶、品尝点心外，还可以欣赏苏州评弹和说书；北方茶馆有说书、相声。\n当代，当子女离开了家庭到外地工作和结婚后，他们就较少探望自己的家人。故此，祖父母也就很少和孙儿见面。前往茶楼品茗就成了家庭相聚的一个重要活动。每逢星期天，中式茶楼常常满座，特别当人们庆祝节日时。这个现象反映了中华文化中的家庭价值观。\n此外，源自台湾的茶艺馆开创了新一代休闲娱乐场所的先河。自20世纪70年代以来，茶艺馆已经从台湾开始，进入到大陆各省市及香港、澳门，以及海外华人聚居区。与之前的茶馆不同的是，茶艺馆里面一般仅提供茶艺服务，由受过专业培训的人员在客人面前进行茶艺的表演，而不提供其他饮食服务。对茶文化的高度重视使得茶艺馆具有一定的文化深度，从而提升其消费品味。\n####茶寮\n茶寮专门用作品茶、进行茶仪式的私家独立小屋。不少私家园林都有设置茶寮。\n##茶与养生\n《神农本草经》记载，神农尝百草，日遇七十毒，得荼而解。荼就是茶的古字。\n唐大中三年（850年）有一位和尚130岁，宣宗皇帝问他服什么药才能如此长寿？和尚答道：“我向来不知药性，平生只爱喝茶，每逢云游到一个地方，先讨茶喝，喝一百碗也不嫌多。”皇帝赐和尚五十斤上等茶。\n明高濂的养生经典《遵生八笺》中写道：“人饮真茶，能止渴消食，除痰少睡，利水道，明目益思，除烦去腻，人固不可一日无茶。”顾元庆《茶谱》亦说: “人饮其茶，能止渴，消食除痰，少睡，利尿道，明目益思，除烦去腻，人固不可一日无茶。”\n##茶史\n中国人饮茶的习惯，从唐、宋、明、清到现代，有很大的变化。饮茶始于汉代，由于隋朝短暂，茶事记载很少。唐朝时的茶叶多加工成茶饼。“茶兴于唐而盛于宋”，在宋代，茶品越来越丰富，饮茶也日益考究，开始重视茶叶的本身的色香味，调味品逐渐减少。此时，出现了用蒸青法制成的散茶，并趋向以散茶为主，同时烹饮的手续也大为简化。到了明代，饼茶、团茶较少见了，较多以喝散茶为主，烹茶方法亦由过去煎茶为主逐步发展为冲泡为主。到了清代，茶与人们的日常生活紧密结合起来，出现了城市的茶馆，并逐步兴起，成为适合各个社会阶层所需的活动场所，并把茶与曲艺、诗会、戏剧、灯谜等民间文化活动融合起来。普通人家也常以茶水招待客人。\n现代，根据不同情况（如不同场合的特殊礼节），中国茶有着不同的泡法。\n###贡茶\n常璩在《华阳国志·巴志》中记载，公元前11世纪，巴、蜀等国曾向周武王进贡茶、蜜等物资。将品质最优良、或产量稀少的茶奉献帝王，开始于唐开宝末年，福建建瓯凤凰山成为御用北苑茶园。宋太平兴国初（975年），特别御制龙凤模，派遣蔡襄为福建转运使往北苑监制龙凤团茶。根据宋代熊蕃所著《宣和北苑贡茶录》记载，仅仅北苑的贡茶就有四十多种，包括“御苑玉芽”、“龙团胜雪”、“万春银叶”、“无疆寿龙”、“瑞云祥龙”、“玉叶长春”等。其中“龙团胜雪”尤其名贵，所采的茶叶必须一芽带一叶，称为“一枪一旗”；再将一枪一旗的芽茶烫热后，只剔出中心一缕，放到贵重的容器里，用清澈的泉水泡浸，晶莹光洁净，如同银线，叫“银线水芽”；然后再用御制龙凤寸方模将银线水芽压成寸方小夸，上有小龙图案，叫“龙团胜雪”。包装十分考究，先用防潮的青箬叶包上几层，再用黄缎包裹，加朱红印封，放入朱漆盒，外加镀金锁。每年御贡的团茶只得一百夸，每夸价值四十万。\n历代贡茶：\n##茶俗\n###以茶祭祀\n茶也是中国传统祭祀常见的祭品之一。以茶祭天始于南齐世祖武皇帝遗诏：“我灵座上慎勿以牲为祭，但设饼果、茶饮、干饭、酒脯而已。”（见陆羽《茶经》。）开后世帝王以茶祭天、祭神、祭山的先河。唐代文人摆茶宴祭泰山。清代帝王祭天之礼大盛。逢正月初九天诞日、七月七日七夕日、八月十五中秋节、十二月二十三灶君日等节日，紫禁城内养心殿摆茶祭神。民间流行中秋节以茶拜祭月娘娘。\n品茶文化普及之后，各种民间祭祀也常用茶为祭品。\n###奉茶、敬茶与送茶\n中国文人喜欢用茶来招待客人。清画家郑板桥题画：“茅屋一间，新篁数竿，雪白纸窗，微浸绿色。此时独坐其中，一盏雨前茶，一方端砚石，一张宣州纸，几笔折枝花，朋友来至，风声竹响，愈喧愈静；家僮扫地，侍女焚香，往来竹阴中，清光映于画，绝可怜爱。”又诗：“月光清峭射楼台，浅夜篱门尚半开，树里灯行知客到，竹间烟起唤茶来 ……坐久谈深天渐曙，红霞冷露满苍苔”，描写黄昏时分朋友来访，主人唤茶招待，二人深谈直到黎明。以茶会友，自然也包括红颜知已，明文震亨说到茶的一项功用：“青衣红袖，密语私谈，可以助情热意。”很多人喜欢和别人一起喝茶，不光为分享美茶，还为了体验和别人在一起的安逸心情。\n在中国社会，当晚辈要向长辈表示尊敬时，会向他们奉上一杯茶。以往，下属要为上级准备茶水；但时至今日，社会变得开放自由，这种传统一般只有重要节日或场合出现。而长辈为晚辈冲茶则是关怀、友好的表现。\n当有人犯了严重错误，或想表示歉意之时，会为对方奉上一杯茶作为表示。\n在中式婚礼上，新人在订婚时常会以茶作为礼物，这是因为茶树种植后根深，不能移植，寓意坚贞。新郎和新娘在正婚礼之后，的见舅姑礼和归宁时，会向自己或配偶的父母、长辈敬茶，父母、长辈喝茶后会给新婚夫妇一个代表着好运的红包，然后新人再向其他亲属逐一奉茶，并会用正式亲属称谓呼来称呼对方，这也代表新人各自与配偶原有的亲属确立姻亲关系。拒绝喝茶表示不同意婚事——这是比较少见的，因为这是会让新夫妇丢脸的事。\n###端茶送客\n。\n##泡茶的水\n杭州虎跑泉\n中国历代对泡茶的水十分讲究，认为水是茶之本。\n明朝人张大复在《梅花草堂笔谈》中写道“茶性必发于水。八分之茶，遇十分之水，茶亦十分矣；八分之水，试十分之茶，茶只八分耳。”\n乾隆帝曾说：“茗饮之本，其必资于水乎？”。乾隆特制银斗，品试全国的泉水，按水的质量分别高下：北京玉泉山第一，中冷泉第二，无锡惠泉第三，杭州虎跑泉第四。（乾隆：《玉泉山天下第一泉记》）\n茶圣陆羽不但是品茶高手，也是品泉高手。\n泉水分以下几种：\n唐代：\n明代：\n清代：\n##相关学术研究\n中国为茶的故乡，对茶的研究相当深入，并有专门研究茶的学问茶学。从唐代茶圣陆羽《茶经》问世以来，历代的茶学专著不下五六百部，流传至今的也有百余部，这是中国茶文化特有的丰富的文化遗产。唐朝封演《封氏闻见记》卷六《饮茶》记有煎茶博士一词：“命奴子取钱三十文，酬煎茶博士。”指的是会煎茶、精通茶艺之人。陆羽被唐德宗当面尊称为“茶博士”。\n###古代茶书\n由于各代备茶、饮茶的方法有很大的不同，要求不同，各代茶书的内容也大不相同。各代茶书是各代茶文化的缩影，由唐代到明代，大体反映一个由繁到简，反归自然的过程。唐代「对花饮茶」一事被认为是煞风景之事。唐、宋盛行“茶团”、“茶饼”（茶砖），制造、备茶、饮茶的程序最复杂，茶团还中常常添加龙脑等香料。宋代的特点是从皇帝到士大夫大兴斗茶之风，追求茶汤表面变幻的图形，享受竞赛的热闹，增设贡茶院。明代是一个大转折点，社会崇尚天人合一，崇尚返归自然，徐渭《密集致品》：“茶宜精舍、宜云林、宜幽人雅士 、宜衲子仙朋、宜松月下、宜花鸟间……”。茶不再讲究添加贵重的香料，也不斗茶，把茶的真香提到第一位，创造了泡散茶的风气，一路延续到今天。\n中国茶学专著见茶学文献列表。\n###现代研究\n中国学者近年来在中国茶文化的研究上有不少成绩，《中国茶文化丛书》1-8册，二千余页内容丰富，是近年可喜的成果。\n## 参考文献\n### 来源\n书籍"], "selected_questions":

["中国茶文化的历史起源可以追溯到神农时代，大约在公元前2737-2697年。据传说，神农尝百草发现并利用了茶叶的药用价值。然而，茶作为饮料和精神享受的正式发展可以追溯到西汉时期，公元前202年至公元8年之间。这一时期的历史记载中已经提到了茶叶的生产、饮用和商业交易。因此，可以说中国茶文化的历史起源可以追溯到西汉时期。", "中国茶文化的发展阶段有古代茶文化阶段、现代茶文化阶段。具体特点如下：\n\n1. 古代茶文化阶段：这个阶段主要包括三国以前的茶文化、晋代茶文化、唐代茶文化、宋代茶文化、明清茶文化。这些时期茶文化逐渐形成并发展，注重饮茶的精神享受和道德规范，茶的冲泡技术不断提高，并与儒、道、佛三教哲学思想交融，茶的形式也多样，如斗茶、点茶、泡茶等，茶书、茶诗词流传至今。\n\n2. 现代茶文化阶段：这个阶段主要包括新中国成立后的茶文化发展。茶叶生产规模不断扩大，各地茶文化的特色逐渐形成，茶叶的历史、品种、泡法等方面的知识逐渐被人们所熟知。茶文化的传播方式和形式也发生了变化，如茶文化节、茶艺表演等活动的举办，茶文化的国际交流也日益频繁。\n\n总的来说，中国茶文化的发展阶段可归纳为古代茶文化阶段和现代茶文化阶段。古代茶文化以精神享受和道德规范为主，注重呈现茶的精神内涵；现代茶文化在继承和发展传统茶文化的基础上，更注重茶的社会功能和经济价值。", "泡茶的水对茶的品质有重要的影响。根据唐代文人张大复的描述，茶的品质与煮茶的水的比例息息相关。他说：“茶性必发于水。八分之茶，遇十分之水，茶亦十分矣；八分之水，试十分之茶，茶只八分耳。”这说明水的质量和比例会对茶的味道产生影响。\n\n茶叶需要与煮茶的水充分交融，在泡茶的过程中，茶叶中的有效物质会溶解到水中，使茶的香味、口感和色泽得以展现出来。因此，水的质量非常重要。\n\n茶叶一般都喜欢使用软化的水，硬水中的矿物质会对茶叶的味道产生干扰，影响茶的口感。而水质柔软的泉水、矿泉水或纯净水都适合用来泡茶。\n\n此外，水温也是影响茶品质的重要因素。不同种类的茶叶需要不同温度的水来泡制，过烫或过冷的水都会影响茶叶的味道。一般来说，绿茶需要较低温度的水，黑茶需要较高温度的水。\n\n综上所述，茶的品质与煮茶的水的质量和温度密切相关，水的质量和温度选择适宜的话，可以提高茶的香味、口感和色泽，使茶叶充分展现出其独特的特点。"],

史记\n\n是中国历史上第一部，全书共一百三十篇，分为本纪、书、表、世家、列传五种形式。传记的一种，主要记诸侯之事。作者是西汉时期的司马迁。《史记》约成书于公元前104年至公元前91年，本来是没有书名的，司马迁完成这部巨著后曾给当时的大学者东方朔看过，东方朔非常钦佩，就在书上加了“太史公”三字。“太史”是司马迁的官职，“公”是美称，“太史公”也只是表明谁的著作而已。班固的《汉书·艺文志》在著录这部书时，改成《太史公百三十篇》，后人则又简化成“太史公记”、“太史公书”、“太史公传”。《史记》最初没有固定书名，一般称为“太史公书”，或称“太史公记”，也省称 “太史公”。“史记”本来是古代史书的通称，从三国开始，“史记”由通称逐渐成为“太史公书”的专名。近人梁启超称赞这部巨著是“千古之绝作”（《论中国学术思想变迁之大势》）。鲁迅誉之为“史家之绝唱，无韵之《离骚》”（《汉文学史纲》）\n\n### 汉书\n\n《汉书》，又称《前汉书》，由我国东汉时期的历史学家班固编撰，是中国第一部纪传体断代史，“二十四史”之一。《汉书》是继《史记》之后我国古代又一部重要史书，与《史记》、《后汉书》《三国志》并称为“前四史”。 《汉书》全书主要记述了上起西汉的汉高祖元年（公元前206年），下至新朝的王莽地皇四年（公元23年），共230年的史事。《汉书》包括纪十二篇，表八篇，志十篇，传七十篇，共一百篇，后人划分为一百二十卷，共八十万字。\n\n### 后汉书\n\n《后汉书》南宋绍兴刊本《后汉书》是一部记载东汉历史的纪传体史书，与《史记》《汉书》《三国志》合称“四史”。书中分十纪、八十列传和八志（司马彪续作），记载了从王莽起至汉献帝的195年历史。\n\n### 三国志\n\n《三国志》是西晋陈寿编写的一部主要记载魏、蜀、吴三国鼎立时期的纪传体国别史，详细记载了从魏文帝黄初元年（220）到晋武帝太康元年（280）六十年的历史，受到后人推崇。\n\n## 后世评价\n\n司马迁，字子长，父亲司马谈任太史令，写古今通史的愿望没有实现，临终要司马迁完成其夙愿。后来，司马迁继任父亲太史令之职，开始写《史记》，他用了14 年的时间，终于写成了这部50多万字的著作。", "# 四史\n\n习近平总书记提出的新四史\n\n“四史”指的是党史、新中国史、改革开放史、社会主义发展史。简而言之，党史是中国共产党从无到有、从小到大、从弱到强、不断从胜利走向新的胜利的历史。新中国史是中华民族从站起来、富起来到强起来的历史。改革开放史是中国人民从温饱不足到小康富裕的历史。社会主义发展史是社会主义从创立、发展到完善的历史。\n\n党史、新中国史、改革开放史、社会主义发展史，既密切关联又各有侧重。学习“四史”要统筹推进，以党史为重点，突出各自特点，讲清楚中国共产党为什么“能”、马克思主义为什么“行”、中国特色社会主义为什么“好”，从而明理增信崇德力行。## 发展历史\n\n四史，又名新四史。即习近平总书记提出的：党史、新中国史、改革开放史、社会主义发展史。\n习近平总书记指出，“只有坚持思想建党、理论强党，不忘初心才能更加自觉，担当使命才能更加坚定”“要把学习贯彻党的创新理论作为思想武装的重中之重，并同学习党史、新中国史、改革开放史、社会主义发展史结合起来”。“四史”内容各有侧重，但整体讲的就是中国共产党为人民谋幸福、为民族谋复兴、为世界谋大同的实践史，中国共产党的领导是“四史”的主线。\n2021年6月，中共中央办公厅印发《关于在全社会开展党史、新中国史、改革开放史、社会主义发展史宣传教育的通知》，对“四史”宣传教育作出安排部署。\n\n## 历史传承\n\n“四史”之间密切关联。\n在时间上是叠加的。所谓“史”，最直观的就是时间段。改革开放史从1978年起，是40多年；新中国史从1949年起，是70多年；党史从1921年起，是100年；社会主义发展史，从1516年空想社会主义著作《乌托邦》起，至今有500多年。“四史”并不是时间上互不交叉的四段历史，而是大时段与小时段、前后包容的关系。社会主义发展史最长，包含党史、新中国史、改革开放史；党史次之，包括新中国史、改革开放史；新中国史包含改革开放史。\n在内容上是关联的。社会主义发展史起始最早，社会主义从空想到科学的发展，产生了马克思主义。马克思主义与中国工人运动相结合，产生了中国共产党。中国共产党领导人民艰苦奋斗，建立了新中国。在新中国发展的基础上，进行了改革开放。从社会主义发展史角度，党史、新中国史、改革开放史都是社会主义发展史的不同阶段的展开,“四史”归宗于社会主义发展史。从党史角度，社会主义发展史是党史的源头，新中国史、改革开放史是党史的成果，“四史”是一部延展的大党史。从新中国史、改革开放史角度，社会主义发展史、党史落脚到当下，就集中体现到社会主义的建设和改革之中。\n“四史”是一个整体，它们之间接续传承、融会贯通。正因为如此，我们要把学习党史、新中国史、改革开放史、社会主义发展史结合起来。需要指出的是，“四史”既是指四门具体的历史，在某种更为广阔的意义上，又是指代历史教育，甚至不限于具体的“四史”本身。比如在大历史的阶段中，更长的还有中国文明5000年历史；还有鸦片战争开始的中国近代史；还有《共产党宣言》开始的马克思主义发展史。这些历史以及各种专门史，都可以纳入到广义的历史教育之中。\n\n## 新旧区别\n\n“四史”各自内容侧重。社会主义发展史500多年，从时间上看，在中国共产党成立之前的400多年历史是独有的，在其他三个历史中并不包括这一段；从国别上看，社会主义发展史中有关中国之外的世界社会主义理论和实践的内容，也是独有的，其他三个历史也没有这一块内容。在社会主义发展史中，空想社会主义产生和发展，马克思、恩格斯创立科学社会主义理论体系，列宁领导十月革命胜利并实践社会主义，苏联模式逐步形成，以及当今国外社会主义的内容，既是重要的，也是独有的。\n中国共产党历史100年，从中国共产党的成立到建立新中国之前的历史，是新中国史和改革开放史所没有的；这段历史，比社会主义发展史更为详细、更聚焦于中国。关于中国共产党的创立，关于土地革命、抗日战争、解放战争，关于毛泽东思想等，关于适合中国国情的革命道路等，无疑在中国共产党历史中具有特殊的地位和分量。\n新中国史70多年，从新中国成立到改革开放之前的这30年，这段历史是改革开放史中所没有的，其比中共党史的相关阐述更为详细；新中国史的“国史”视角，也与“党史”的视角有所区别。关于中华人民共和国的成立、关于社会主义制度的建立、关于社会主义的艰辛探索，在新中国史中具有特殊的地位和价值。\n改革开放史40多年，很显然对改革开放以来的阐述，比之其他三个历史更为详细。关于党的十一届三中全会、关于改革开放、关于社会主义市场经济、关于中国特色社会主义进入新时代等，这些与现实交融的鲜活历史是改革开放史的核心内容。\n之所以是“四史”，而不是“一史”，说明每个历史都有内容上的独特性和重点，不能以其中“一史”代替其他“三史”。党史教育，应着重讲清楚中国共产党的性质和宗旨，中国共产党为国家和民族作出的重大贡献，为什么要始终坚持党的领导；新中国史教育，应着重讲清楚新中国的性质，新中国取得的历史成就，为什么要坚持和捍卫新中国的基本制度；改革开放史教育，应着重讲清楚为什么实行改革开放，改革开放的伟大成就，为什么新时代要坚持全面深化改革和扩大开放不动摇；社会主义发展史教育，应着重讲清楚马克思主义的真理性，社会主义代替资本主义的必然性，中国特色社会主义在世界社会主义发展进程中的历史地位。总之，要在“四史”教育中结合各门历史的特点，讲清楚中国共产党为什么“能”、马克思主义为什么“行”、中国特色社会主义为什么“好”等重大问题。\n\n## 教育安排\n\n“四史”教育科学安排。“四史”教育要以习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为指导。党的十八大以来，习近平总书记就学习中共党史、新中国史、改革开放史、社会主义发展史作出一系列重要论述。这些重要论述是习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的重要组成部分，是推进“四史”教育的理论指引。要把“四史”教育与学习习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想紧密结合起来，更加自觉地以党的创新理论武装头脑、指导实践、推动工作。\n“四史”教育要与思想政治教育相统筹。习近平总书记多次指出，要将“四史”教育，与加强爱国主义、集体主义、社会主义教育，社会主义核心价值观教育，中华优秀传统文化和革命文化、社会主义先进文化教育，国家意识、法治意识、社会责任意识教育，民族团结进步教育、国家安全教育、科学精神教育等相结合。党的十九届五中全会提出要“推动理想信念教育常态化制度化，加强党史、新中国史、改革开放史、社会主义发展史教育”。教育部等颁布的《关于加快构建高校思想政治工作体系的意见》，将“加强党史、新中国史、改革开放史、社会主义发展史教育”融入高校思想政治理论课。\n“四史”教育要以党史教育为重点。党史是“四史”的核心与关键所在，在“四史”中有着独特而重要的理论地位。从政治上，中国共产党是社会主义发展的主体，是新中国的建立者，是改革开放的推动者。“四史”内容各有侧重点，但主线是中国共产党为人民谋幸福、为民族谋复兴、为世界谋大同的探索实践史。从实践上，在中国共产党百年华诞、全党开展党史学习教育之际，将党史教育提到更加突出的地位是理所当然的。\n“四史”教育要探索合适的落地安排。各行各业都要开展“四史”教育，而“四史”教育的形式应该是多种多样的。就高等学校而言，有关部门要求将“四史”教育融入到所有思政必修课中，有条件的高校要开设“四史”教育专门课程，全国重点马克思主义学院率先行动。在进行“四史”教育的实践中，有的大学开设两门课程，即“中国共产党历史”和“社会主义发展史”。在“中国共产党历史”中，包括党史、新中国史、改革开放史内容，因为它们之间关系极为密切，都是几代共产党人在同一信仰凝聚下、同一信念引领下、同一追求驱动下始终不渝的奋斗探索历程。“社会主义发展史”单独开一门课，主要侧重于中国共产党成立之前的世界社会主义历史和中国之外的世界社会主义理论和实践。\n“四史”教育旨在明理增信崇德力行。加强“四史”教育，就是要弄清楚当今中国所处的历史方位和自己所应担负的历史责任，深刻理解中华民族从站起来、富起来到强起来的历史逻辑、理论逻辑和实践逻辑，增强听党话、跟党走的思想自觉和行动自觉，牢固树立中国特色社会主义的道路自信、理论自信、制度自信、文化自信。要通过“四史”教育有效提升政治认同、思想认同、情感认同，真正做到“学史明理、学史增信、学史崇德、学史力行”，坚定对马克思主义的信仰、对中国特色社会主义的信念、对中华民族伟大复兴中国梦的信心，以昂扬姿态为全面建设社会主义现代化国家而努力奋斗。"],

后李文化\n\n新石器时代文化的一种\n\n后李文化，中国新石器时代文化的一种，因首次发掘山东淄博市临淄区后李文化遗址而得名。该文化分布范围主要在泰沂山系北侧的山前地带。\n后李遗址是山东省文物考古研究所在配合济南至青岛高速公路建设工程时发现的。经过正式发掘的遗址主要有临淄后李、潍坊前埠下、张店彭家庄、章丘小荆山、西河、邹平孙家、西南村、长清月庄等。经碳十四测定，其年代大约距今8500——7500年之间，前后延续约一千多年时间。\n\n这是迄今为止在中国北方发现的最早的新石器时代的文化遗址之一，被列为1992年度全国十大考古新发现之一。## 遗址概况\n\n遗迹主要有房址、壕沟、灰坑和墓葬等。房址均为半地穴式。平面多圆角方型或长方形，面积一般30—50平方米，大者50余平方米。居住面有的经过烧烤，多发现灶址和一些陶、石器等生活用具。\n墓葬流行长方形土坑竖穴，排列比较整齐，个别挖墓室，均未见葬具。死者头向多朝东，有的向北。葬式多单人仰身直肢葬。多无随葬品，少数放置蚌壳，个别见有陶支脚。墓室一般长2米左右，宽在0.6—0.8米之间。\n陶器以红褐陶为主，红、灰褐、黑褐、青灰褐陶次之。制作工艺为泥条盘筑，器表多素面，器形以圜底器为主，仅发现少量平底器和圈足器。器类主要有釜、罐、壶、盂、盆、钵、碗、形器、杯、盘、器盖和支脚等。\n\n## 发现\n\n1992年，省市文物部门在临淄齐陵镇的后李家村发掘古车马遗址时，发现了一些古代陶器的碎片，经文物专家鉴定，约距今8200—8500年，证明淄博的陶瓷历史最早可上溯到新石器时期的后李文化时代。\n\n## 自然环境\n\n通过对遗址中的孢粉进行分析，发现样本中均以草本植物花粉居优势，据统计，最多可占孢粉总数的76.3—91.1%。在草本花粉中依据数量的多少，依次为蒿、乔本科、藜科及菊科，还有少量蓼、莎草及香蒲等。木本植物花粉次之，主要以针叶植物松居多数，还有少量的桦、栎、榆及胡桃等阔叶植物花粉，蕨类植物孢子较少，有卷柏、水龙骨科等。\n可以推论，这一时期，后李遗址的植被具有明显的草原特征，草本植物比较茂盛，在低洼、沼地及积水之处主要生长着香蒲、莎草、狐尾藻及水蕨等，大量中生、旱生的蒿、藜及禾本科等分布于平原、低地及开阔平坦之处，在遗址附近的低山、丘陵之上主要生长着松、桦、桤木及胡桃等针阔叶植物。气候环境是温和稍干中掺杂着暖湿，属温带大陆性季风气候。特别是一些好暖湿的阔叶植物花粉，如榆、栎、胡桃等，在遗址中部含量相对较多，上下部含量相对较少，可以看出遗址堆积期间由下而上植被和气候曾发生明显的变化，中期或中部，气候相对较佳，温暖较湿。\n栎、榆等喜暖的阔叶林植物花粉含量较高，还分析出了只能生长在长江流域淡水中的水蕨属植物孢子。由此证明，这一时期气候比较暖湿，可能比今高出2—3度左右。环境一度较优美，既有旱生植物、水草及灌丛，也有低地及水体，当时居住区域，地势比较平坦，接近河边，有不少野生动物栖息与嬉戏在这里。\n另外，还分析出一些禾本科植物花粉，其形态酷似谷子。看来当时先民可能已经学会农业栽培，食物来源主要靠种植谷物，也辅以狩猎和捕鱼。 潍坊前埠下遗址的植物硅酸体样品中，植物硅酸体的含量不仅丰富且保存完整；不仅有成组的方形、棒形硅酸体；还发现含有大量的碳屑；统计到的硅酸体类型有棒形、尖形、哑铃形、长方形、扇形、方形、中鞍形、帽形、芦苇形、毛发形等，其中以长方形和方形硅酸体为主，各占30%和26%左右，其次为棒形、尖形和扇形。植物硅酸体分析结果提供了下列有关环境信息：硅酸体组合中以长方形为主，表明当时在遗址周围生长了大量反映温暖湿润环境的一些植物种类。\n前埠下遗址中发现的动物遗骸种类较多，对恢复当时的自然环境具有重要的作用。根据对动物骨骼的研究，前埠下遗址中发现的动物，经鉴定主要有丽蚌、蓝蚬、青蛤、青鱼、草鱼、鲶鱼、鳖、鸡、中华鼢鼠、狗、狐、貉、狗獾、野猪、家猪、獐、梅花鹿、鹿、水牛等。\n这些动物及其生活习性，同样反映出后李文化后期直至大汶口文化早、中期阶段，文化面上的自然景观，前埠下一带为大河入海处的森林一草甸环境；南边远处的山坡上覆盖着森林，水量充足的潍河经前埠下向北归入大海；河两岸的草地上分布着大大小小的沟湾港汊和积水洼地，河岸湖滨的埠丘上灌木丛生。虎、猫、水牛、梅花鹿等出没于丛林或游荡于灌木丛中，獐、鹿、野猪、狗獾等穿梭于林间草地与河滨芦苇丛中；狐、貉等常在河滨捕食鱼虾，为狩猎经济提供了良好的自然环境。当时的气候比较温和，且降水充沛，年平均气温可能要比当今高4——5度，大致与福建一带的气候相似。先民们就在这滨河临海的埠丘附近过着渔猎和农耕生活。\n章丘小荆山遗址是后李文化时期一处重要遗址，山东省文物考古研究所等单位多次对该遗址进行田野考古调查、勘探和发掘工作。发掘中出土700多件动物遗骸，经过鉴定主要发现有软体动物、鱼类动物、爬行类动物、鸟类动物和哺乳动物五大类，至少可以代表22个种属。种类有圆顶珠蚌、珠蚌、扭蚌、俭状矛蚌、楔蚌、丽蚌、蓝蚬、青鱼、草鱼、鳖、雉、斑鹿、鹿、羊、牛、马、野猪、家猪、狼、家犬、狐、貉等。在这些动物中，其中七种为淡水软体动物，两种淡水鱼，一种鳖，一种鸟，六种野生兽类和五种家畜。淡水软体动物主要以珠蚌、楔、蚌和丽蚌等为代表，是一些流水型软体动物。淡水鱼为吞食能力很强的青鱼和草鱼。\n这些淡水软体动物和鱼类动物是先民们主要捕捞和食用的对象。两块鳖甲表明先民们曾猎捕过这类爬行动物。野生动物主要是斑鹿、鹿、狼、狐、貉和野猪等，在家畜中，猪的遗骸最多，约可代表10余头不同年龄、不同性别的个体，这些猪属于较原始类型或半驯化的家猪。其次是狗，与狼有较大差别，属于驯化类型。特别是各种楔蚌、丽蚌等，现主要分布于温暖湿润的南方省区，栖居在河流及与河流相似的湖泊中，这类生物的发现，表明当时的气候比较温暖、湿润，降水丰富，年平均气温可能要比当今高4－5度，大致与南方省区的气候相似；同时说明当地有能够适应于这类软体动物生存的流水环境，即滨崖底质为泥沙，并有流量中等的河流及湖泊的存在。鱼、鳖等生物依赖于水域而生活；貉也是河滨捕食鱼类及各种小动物，看来遗址周围曾经是水丰草美、鱼戏兽逐的河、湖之滨。为斑鹿、牛、羊等生物的理想居所。狐、野猪等常栖身于河流、湖泊附近的灌木丛或山林之中。狼骸的出土，进一步表明遗址附近曾有便于狼栖居的山林、丘壑。\n由此看来，动物鉴定结果与植物硅酸体以及孢粉分析所反映的自然环境基本是一致的。自然环境是人类赖以生存和发展的客观载体，在特定条件下，自然环境往往制约甚至决定人类的生存与生产方式，亦即在不同的自然环境中常常存在着不同经济的文化类型，以及与之相适应的居住生活方式等。\n\n所以，人类所创造的文化遗存。包括聚落形态等无不深深地保留着自然环境的烙印和特征。通过对后李文化时期的动物组合、遗骸、孢粉组合、硅酸体分析等有关环境资料的初步分析，可以看出，山东地区在后李文化时期自然环境较今有很大的不同。这里曾经是气候温暖，水网密布的亚热带景观。孢粉显示，当时的气候特征是温暖湿润的，遗址附近有沼泽和大面积的水域，山地有森林覆盖，反映的是湿热的亚热带气候环境，其植被具有明显的草原特征。后李文化的先民就是在这样的自然环境下从事各种生产活动、繁衍生息，并创造出了光辉灿烂的古代文化。"],

W. Cooley和J. W. Tukey合作发表An algorithm for the machine calculation of complex Fourier series之后开始为人所知。但后来发现，实际上这两位作者只是重新发明了高斯在1805年就已经提出的算法（此算法在历史上数次以各种形式被再次提出）。\n库利-图基算法最有名的应用，是将序列长为N 的DFT分割为两个长为N/2 的子序列的DFT，因此这一应用只适用于序列长度为2的幂的DFT计算，即基2-FFT。实际上，如同高斯和Cooley与Tukey都指出的那样，Cooley-Tukey算法也可以用于序列长度N 为任意因数分解形式的DFT，即混合基FFT，而且还可以应用于其他诸如分裂基FFT等变种。尽管Cooley-Tukey算法的基本思路是采用递归的方法进行计算，大多数传统的算法实现都将显式的递归算法改写为非递归的形式。另外，因为Cooley-Tukey算法是将DFT分解为较小长度的多个DFT，因此它可以同任一种其他的DFT算法联合使用。\n###

100\n000 → 000\n001 → 100\n010 → 010\n011 → 110\n100 → 001\n101 → 101\n110 → 011\n111 → 111\n倒置后的编号为{0,4,2,6,1,5,3,7}。\n然后将这n个点列作为输入传送到蝶形结网络中，注意将因子逐层加入到蝶形网络中。\n###算法复杂度\n由于按蝶形结网络计算n点变换要进行log n层计算，每层计算n个点的变换，故算法的时间复杂度为。\n## 其他算法\n在Cooley-Tukey算法之外还有其他DFT的快速演算法。对于长度且与互质的序列，可以采用基于中国剩余定理的互质因子算法将N长序列的DFT分解为两个子序列的DFT。与Cooley-Tukey算法不同的是，互质因子算法不需要旋转因子。\nRader-Brenner算法是类似于Cooley-Tukey算法，但是采用的旋转因子都是纯虚数，以增加加法运算和降低了数值稳定性为代价减少了乘法运算。这方法之后被split-radix variant of Cooley-Tukey所取代，与Rader-Brenner演算法相比，有一样多的乘法量，却有较少的加法量，且不牺牲数值的准确性。\nBruun以及QFT演算法是不断的把DFT分成许多较小的DFT运算。（Rader-Brenner以及QFT演算法是为了2的指数所设计的演算法，但依然可以适用在可分解的整数上。Bruun演算法则可以运用在可被分成偶数个运算的数字）。尤其是Bruun演算法，把FFT看成是，并把它分解成与的形式。\n另一个从多项式观点的快速傅立叶变换法是Winograd算法。此演算法把分解成cyclotomic多项式，而这些多项式的系数通常为1，0，-1。这样只需要很少的乘法量（如果有需要的话），所以winograd是可以得到最少乘法量的快速傅立叶演算法，对于较小的数字，可以找出有效率的算方式。更精确地说，winograd演算法让DFT可以用点的DFT来简化，但减少乘法量的同时，也增加了非常多的加法量。Winograd也可以利用剩余值定理来简化DFT。\nRader演算法提出了利用点数为N（N为质数）的DFT进行长度为N-1的回旋折积来表示原本的DFT，如此就可利用折积用一对基本的FFT来计算DFT。另一个prime-size的FFT演算法为chirp-Z演算法。此法也是将DFT用折积来表示，此法与Rader演算法相比，能运用在更一般的转换上，其转换的基础为Z转换（Rabiner et al., 1969）。\n## 实数或对称资料专用的演算法\n在许多的运用当中，要进行DFT的资料是纯实数，如此一来经过DFT的结果会满足对称性：\n=\n而有一些演算法是专门为这种情形设计的（e.g. Sorensen, 1987）。另一些则是利用旧有的演算法（e.g. Cooley-Tukey），删去一些不必要的演算步骤，如此省下了记忆体的使用，也省下了时间。另一方面，也可以把一个偶数长度且纯实数的DFT，用长度为原本一半的复数型态DFT来表示（实数项为原本纯实数资料的偶数项，虚数项则为奇数项）。\n在Matlab上用一次N点FFT计算两个N点实数信号x,y的FFT:\nfunction X,Y = Real2FFT( x,y )\n% N-point FFT is used for 2 real signals both with length N\nN = length(x);\nz = x+y*i ;\nZ = fft(z);\nX = 0.5*(Z+conj(Z(1+mod(0:-1:1-N,N))));\nY = 0.5*(Z-conj(Z(1+mod(0:-1:1-N,N))))/i;\nend\n一度人们认为，用离散哈特利转换（Discrete Hartley Transform）来处理纯实数的DFT会更有效率，但接着人们发现，对于同样点数的纯实数DFT，经过设计的FFT，可以比DHT省下更多的运算。Bruun演算法是第一个试着从减少实数输入的DFT运算量的演算法，但此法并没有成为人们普遍使用的方法。\n对于实数输入，且输入为偶对称或奇对称的情形，可以更进一步的省下时间以及记忆体，此时DFT可以用离散余弦转换或离散正弦转换来代替（Discrete cosine/sine transforms）。由于DCT/DST也可以设计出FFT的演算法，故在此种情形下，此方法取代了对DFT设计的FFT演算法。\nDFT可以应用在频谱分析以及做折积的运算，而在此处，不同应用可以用不同的演算法来取代，列表如下：\n用来做频谱分析的情况下，DFT可用下列的演算法代替：\n用来做折积的情况下，DFT可用下列的演算法代替：\n## 复杂度以及运算量的极限\n长久以来，人们对于求出快速傅立叶变换的复杂度下限以及需要多少的运算量感到很有兴趣，而实际上也还有许多问题需要解决。即使是用较简单的情形，即点的DFT，也还没能够严谨的证明出FFT至少需要（不比小）的运算量，目前也没有发现复杂度更低的演算法。通常数学运算量的多寡会是运算效率好坏最主要的因素，但在现实中，有许多因素也会有很大的影响，如快取记忆体以及CPU均有很大的影响。\n在1978年，Winograd率先导出一个较严谨的FFT所需乘法量的下限：。当时，DFT只需要次无理实数的乘法即可以计算出来。更详尽，且也能趋近此下限的演算法也一一被提出（Heideman & Burrus, 1986; Duhamel, 1990）。很可惜的是，这些演算法，都需要很大量的加法计算，目前的硬体无法克服这个问题。\n对于所需加法量的数目，虽然我们可以在某些受限制的假设下，推得其下限，但目前并没有一个精确的下限被推导出来。1973年，Morgenstern在乘法常数趋近巨大的情形下（对大部分的FFT演算法为真，但不是全部）推导出加法量的下限：。Pan（1986）在假设FFT演算法的不同步的情形有其极限下证明出加法量的下限，但一般来说，此假设相当的不明确。长度为的情形下，在某些假设下，Papadimitriou（1979）提出使用Cooley-Tukey演算法所需的复数加法量是最少的。到目前为止，在长度为情况，还没有任何FFT的演算法可以让复数的加法量比还少。\n还有一个问题是如何把乘法量与加法量的总和最小化，有时候称作\"演算复杂度\"（在这里考虑的是实际的运算量，而不是渐近复杂度）。同样的，没有一个严谨下限被证明出来。从1968年开始，点DFT而言，split-radix FFT演算法需要最少的运算量，在的情形下，其需要个乘法运算以及加法运算。最近有人导出更低的运算量：。（Johnson and Frigo, 2007; Lundy and Van Buskirk, 2007）\n大多数尝试要降低或者证明FFT复杂度下限的人都把焦点放在复数资料输入的情况，因其为最简单的情形。但是，复数资料输入的FFT演算法，与实数资料输入的FFT演算法，离散余弦转换（DCT），离散哈特列转换（DHT），以及其他的演算法，均有很大的关连性。故任何一个演算法，在复杂度上有任何的改善的话，其他的演算法复杂度也会马上获得改善（Duhamel & Vetterli, 1990）。\n## 快速演算法查表\n当输入信号长度为N时:\nN = 1~60\nN  1000\n##延伸阅读\n分类:数学术语", "同义词\n快速傅里叶变换（计算机计算离散傅里叶变换的计算方法统称）一般指FFT原理\n\nFFT是一种DFT的高效算法，称为快速傅立叶变换（fast Fourier transform）。傅里叶变换是时域一频域变换分析中最基本的方法之一。在数字处理领域应用的离散傅里叶变换(DFT：Discrete Fourier Transform)是许多数字信号处理方法的基础\n。\n\n## 原理简介\n\n由于计算机技术的快速发展，在70年代中期，美国和日本的一些电子设备企业开始设计和生产数字式傅里叶分析仪，但是由于离散傅里叶变换的计算量较大，直到DFT的快速算法(FFT)发现之后，有限离散傅里叶变换(DFT)才真正获得了广泛的应用\n。\nFFT是一种DFT的高效算法，称为快速傅立叶变换（fast Fourier transform）。FFT算法可分为按时间抽取算法和按频率抽取算法，先简要介绍FFT的基本原理。从DFT运算开始，说明FFT的基本原理。\nDFT的运算为：\n\n式中\n\n由这种方法计算DFT对于X（K）的每个K值，需要进行4N次实数相乘和（4N-2）次相加，对于N个k值，共需N\\*N乘和N（4N-2）次实数相加。改进DFT算法，减小它的运算量，利用DFT中\n\n的周期性和对称性，使整个DFT的计算变成一系列迭代运算，可大幅度提高运算过程和运算量，这就是FFT的基本思想。\n\n## 分类\n\nFFT基本上可分为两类，时间抽取法和频率抽取法，而一般的时间抽取法和频率抽取法只能处理长度N=2\n所谓抽选，就是把长序列分为短序列的过程，可在时域也可在频域进行。最常用的时域抽选方法是按奇偶将长序列不断地变为短序列，结果使输入序列为倒序，输出序列为顺序排列，这就是Coolly—Tukey算法\n。\n时间抽取\n设N点序列x(n),\n\n,将x(n)按奇偶分组，公式如图2所示：\n\n改写为：\n\n一个N点DFT分解为两个 N/2点的DFT，\n\n继续分解，迭代下去，其运算量约为\n\n其算法有如下规律：\n两个4点组成的8点DFT：\n\n四个2点组成的8点DFT：\n按时间抽取的8点DFT：\n原位计算\n当数据输入到存储器中以后，每一级运算的结果仍然储存在同一组存储器中，直到最后输出，中间无需其它存储器。\n序数重排\n对按时间抽取FFT的原位运算结构，当运算完毕时，这种结构存储单元A(1)、A(2)，…，A(8)中正好顺序存放着X(0)，X(1)，X(2)，…，X(7)，因此可直接按顺序输出，但这种原位运算的输入x(n)却不能按这种自然顺序存入存储单元中，而是按X(0)，X(4)，X(2)，X(6)，…，X(7)的顺序存入存储单元，这种顺序看起来相当杂乱，然而它也是有规律的。当用二进制表示这个顺序时，它正好是“码位倒置”的顺序。\n蝶形类型随迭代次数成倍增加。\n每次迭代的蝶形类型比上一次蝶代增加一倍，数据点间隔也增大一倍。\n频率抽取\n频率抽取2FFT算法是按频率进行抽取的算法。\n设N=2\n\n按K的奇偶分为两组，即\n\n得到两个N/2 点的DFT运算。如此分解，并迭代，总的计算量和时间抽取（DIT）基2FFT算法相同。\n算法规律如下：\n蝶形结构和时间抽取不一样但是蝶形个数一样，同样具有原位计算规律，其迭代次数成倍减小。\n组合数基四FFT\nN≠2\nChirp-z变换\n前面介绍，采用FFT算法可以很快算出全部N点DFT值，即z变换X（z）在z平面单位圆上的全部等间隔取样值。实际中也许①不需要计算整个单位圆上z变换的取样，如对于窄带信号，只需要对信号所在的一段频带进行分析，这时希望频谱的采样集中在这一频带内，以获得较高的分辨率，而频带以外的部分可不考虑，②或者对其它围线上的z变换取样感兴趣，例如语音信号处理中，需要知道z变换的极点所在频率，如极点位置离单位圆较远，则其单位圆上的频谱就很平滑，这时很难从中识别出极点所在的频率，如果采样不是沿单位圆而是沿一条接近这些极点的弧线进行，则在极点所在频率上的频谱将出现明显的尖峰，由此可较准确地测定极点频率。③或者要求能有效地计算当N是素数时序列的DFT，因此提高DFT计算的灵活性非常有意义。\n螺旋线采样是一种适合于这种需要的变换，且可以采用FFT来快速计算，这种变换也称作Chirp-z变换。\n\n## 应用\n\nFFT计算IDFT\nDFT变换则说明对于时间有限的信号（有限长序列），也可以对其进行频域采样，而不丢失任何信息。所以只要时间序列足够长，采样足够密，频域采样也就可较好地反映信号的频谱趋势，所以FFT可以用以进行连续信号的频谱分析。\n当然，这里作了几次近似处理：\n1、用离散采样信号的傅立叶变换来代替连续信号的频谱，只有在严格满足采样定理的前提下，频谱才不会有畸变，否则只是近似；\n2、用有限长序列来代替无限长离散采样信号。\nFFT计算线性卷积\n线性卷积是求离散系统响应的主要方法之一,许多重要应用都建立在这一理论基础上,如卷积滤波等。\n以前曾讨论了用圆周卷积计算线性卷积的方法归纳如下:\n将长为N2的序列x(n)延长到L,补L-N2个零\n将长为N1的序列h(n)延长到L,补L-N1个零\n如果L≥N1+N2-1,则圆周卷积与线性卷积相等，此时，可有FFT计算线性卷积，方法如下:\na.计算X(k)=FFT[x(n)]\nb.求H(k)=FFT[h(n)]\nc.求Y(k)=H(k)Y(k) k=0～L-1\nd.求y(n)=IFFT[Y(k)] n=0～L-1\n可见，只要进行二次FFT,一次IFFT就可完成线性卷积计算。计算表明,L>32时,上述计算线性卷积的方法比直接计算线卷积有明显的优越性,因此,也称上述圆周卷积方法为快速卷积法\nFFT计算相关函数\n互相关和自相关函数的计算可利用FFT实现。由于离散付里叶变换隐含着周期性，所以用FFT计算离散相关函数也是对周期序列而言的。直接做N点FFT相当于对两个N点序列x(n)、y(n)作周期延拓，作相关后再取主值（类似圆周卷积）。而实际一般要求的是两个有限长序列的线性相关，为避免混淆，需采用与圆周卷积求线性卷积相类似的方法，先将序列延长补0后再用上述方法。\n实数序列FFT\n信号是实数序列，任何实数都可看成虚部为零的复数，例如，求某实信号y(n)的复谱,可认为是将实信号加上数值为零的虚部变成复信号(x(n)+j0)，再用FFT求其离散付里叶变换。这种作法很不经济，因为把实序列变成复序列，存储器要增加一倍，且计算机运行时，即使虚部为零，也要进行涉及虚部的运算，浪费了运算量。合理的解决方法是利用复数据FFT对实数据进行有效计算，下面介绍方法。\n一个N点FFT同时计算两个N点实序列的DFT\n设x1(n)，x2(n)是彼此独立的两个N点实序列,且X1(k)=DFT[x1(n)]，X2(k)=DFT[x2(n)]\n可通过一次FFT运算同时获得X1(k)，X2(k)。算法如下：\n首先将x1(n)，x2(n)分别当作一复序列的实部及虚部,令\nx(n)=x1(n)+jx2(n)\n通过FFT运算可获得x(n)的DFT值 X(k)=DFT[x1(n)]+jDFT[x2(n)]=X1(k)+jX2(k)\n利用离散付里叶变换的共轭对称性\nX1(K)=1/2\\*[X(k)+[X(N-k)共轭]]\nX2(K)=1/2\\*[X(k)-[X(N-k)共轭]]\n有了x(n)的FFT运算结果X(k),由上式即可得到X1(k),X2(k)的值。"], "selected_questions":

А. Фуфрянский）访华，参加了TE1G型煤气内燃机车的试验总结及卫星型柴油机车的设计审查。同年6月初，四方机车车辆厂就卫星型机车的试制召开了会议，富弗良斯基发表讲话并指出中国研制液力传动内燃机车的速度出乎他的意料，不仅技术上达到了当时世界先进水平，而且培养了大批液力传动内燃机车设计与制造方面的技术人员。\n1959年10月国庆节期间，卫星型柴油机车与戚墅堰机车车辆工厂的先行型柴油机车、大连机车车辆工厂的巨龙型柴油机车、株洲机车车辆工厂的韶山型电力机车一同前往在北京展览馆展出，并于同年12月参加第二次全国工业交通展览会。1959年11月12日，时任全国人大常委会副委员长、中国科学院院长郭沫若前往北京环形铁道视察这几种新机车并亲自题诗祝贺：“电掣风驰今在眼，巨龙追逐卫星奔。韶山初见星星火，此日已经燎大原”。在大跃进运动期间仓促上马的几种内燃机车，由于设计经验不足和制造工艺落后，这几种机车的性能和质量均不尽如人意。经过多年的试验改进后，只有巨龙型和卫星型得以定型并投入批量生产，也就是后来的东风型内燃机车和东方红1型内燃机车。而建设型和先行型机车仅经过初步试验，而未能投入批量生产和正式使用。\n### 试验改进\n1960年，NY1-0001号机车已经试运行3600余公里，后来由于柴油机曲轴发生裂纹而中断试验。1961年，四方机车车辆厂根据第一台机车的试验结果，采用了经过改进的液力传动装置和中间齿轮箱等，试制了第二台卫星型机车（NY1-0002号机车）。NY1-0002号机车出厂后经过多次运行试验，最高试运速度达到100公里/小时（设计构造速度为140公里/小时，因受线路条件限制，没有试验更高速度），柴油机最大运用功率达800马力（设计为1000马力），液力传动装置效率达0.81（设计为0.86），虽然尚未完全达到设计指标，但机车运作情况良好。1961年至1962年期间，为了挽救大跃进造成的机车车辆大量失修的局面，铁道部要求机车车辆工厂“由造转修”，集中力量进行机车车辆养护维修工作，这段时间的内燃机车研制工作进展亦较为缓慢。\n1963年8月，随着铁路机车车辆失修状况开始有了明显好转，为了组织内燃机车和电力机车的生产会战，铁道部机车车辆工厂管理总局会同国家计委、国家经委、国家科委、一机部、三机部、五机部等部委，成立了“大功率牵引动力内燃化、电气化领导小组”，以解决内燃机车和电力机车的选型、定点、配套、协作等问题，目标是在两三年内达到批量生产的水平。同时，国家经委并将内燃机车和电力机车列为国家新产品试制重点项目。1963年9月，国家计委、国家科委、铁道部、铁科院的领导以及有关的主要工程技术人员等前往青岛，对四方机车车辆厂试制液力传动柴油机车的情况作了实地考察，并在胶济铁路青岛至济南区间参加了一次运行试验。考察结束后，领导小组向副总理薄一波、聂荣臻呈交的报告中，明确提出“首先应发展内燃牵引，而发展内燃牵引，必须在继续研究试制电力传动内燃机车的同时，大力研究试制液力传动内燃机车”。\n为了解决卫星型机车的柴油机供应问题，领导小组决定先从西德进口少量高速柴油机，以便在国产柴油机未定型生产前，使用进口柴油机试验液力传动装置及车体结构等；同时，加快四方机车车辆厂的12V175Z型柴油机的试制工作，为日后的生产做好准备；抓紧上海柴油机厂12V180Z型柴油机的定型工作，争取在1965年定型投产。1964年，四方机车车辆厂根据领导小组提出的机车选型方案，研制了红星型液力传动调车柴油机车，作为研制液力传动干线柴油机车的练兵产品。1965年，四方机车车辆厂建成了内燃机车综合试验台、大功率试验台和小功率试验台，并成功试制了工厂第一台12V175Z型柴油机。年内，四方机车车辆厂改进了卫星型机车的司机室钢结构和隔音减震装置，先后生产了NY1-0003、NY1-0004号两台卫星型机车，其中NY1-0003号机车装用了从西德订购的MB 820 Bb型柴油机，而NY1-0004号机车则装用四方机车车辆厂自己制造的12V175Z型柴油机。\n### 定型投产\n四方机车车辆厂对卫星型内燃机车进行了多年的反复试验及改进之后，先后解决了液力传动装置换档不灵、油温过高、变矩器效率过低等问题，于1966年完成了第三次调整设计方案并上报铁道部要求鉴定。与此同时，文化大革命开始之后多种铁路机车都改取富有“革命”气息的名称，卫星型内燃机车亦改称为东方红1型内燃机车，自此掀开了中国铁路以“东方红”命名的液力传动内燃机车家族的生产历史。根据铁道部工业总局的指示，四方机车车辆厂于1966年下半年停止生产蒸汽机车，开始批量生产已定型的东方红1型内燃机车，机车车号序列从4205号开始，而之前生产的四台机车的车号也更改为4201～4204。1972年5月，随着新一代的东方红3型内燃机车研制成功，东方红1型柴油机车亦宣告停产。从1958年到1972年，四方机车车辆厂生产了共106台东方红1型内燃机车（4201～4306）\n与在1966年之前试制的卫星型内燃机车相比，正式定型的东方红1型内燃机车在车体结构和传动装置都有所变化。动力装置主要采用四方机车车辆厂制造的12V175Z型柴油机，少量机车装用上海柴油机厂提供的12V180Z型柴油机；为了提高柴油机的可靠性和使用寿命，将柴油机最大运用功率由1000马力降至910马力。此外，又重新设计了司机室外形，取代了之前使用的流线型车头，既简化了结构和生产过程，又改善乘务员嘹望条件，同时令司机室空间更为宽敞。传动装置采用经过改进的SF3010-1型液力变速箱，当中的液力变扭器型号也在生产过程中经历多次变更。从1968年生产的4275号机车开始，又改用带中冷器的12V175ZL型柴油机，最大运用功率提高至1050马力，机车最高速度从140公里/小时降至120公里/小时。\n### 运用历史\n1966年9月，东方红1型4203号机车首先配属北京铁路局北京机务段投入运用。1968年，锦州铁路局山海关机务段开始从蒸汽机车货运段向内燃机车客运段过渡，同年7月20日配属首批5台东方红1型内燃机车，担当津山铁路的旅客列车牵引任务。1971年，北京机务段和山海关机务段的东方红1型内燃机车配属数量已经分别达到29台、56台。从1970年代起至1980年代初，东方红1型内燃机车曾经是津山铁路和沈山铁路的主力客运机车，主要牵引北京站经由津山铁路天津站至沈阳站区段的旅客列车、国际列车以及领导人专列，通常采用双机联挂。\n1970年10月1日，广州铁路局广州机务段配属东方红1型内燃机车，用于牵引广深铁路广州站至深圳站间的旅客列车，到1972年广州机务段配属东风型内燃机车后，东方红1型内燃机车全部调往其他路局。1971年，随着京原铁路建成通车，太原铁路分局灵丘机务段投入使用，同年配属东方红1型内燃机车3台，至1972年增加到9台，担当灵丘站至原平站间客货列车牵引任务。1976年，灵丘机务段增配新造的东风4型内燃机车，该段的东方红1型内燃机车调往山海关机务段。\n1977年，北京机务段开始大量配属北京型内燃机车，除了用于牵引专列的5台机车仍然留在北京机务段，其余的东方红1型内燃机车全部集中配属山海关机务段。截至1978年末，扣除已报废的6台机车（4201～4204、4209、4210），山海关机务段配属东方红1型机车共95台。当时，除了山海关站经由津山铁路天津站至至济南站区间的三对交路由NY7型内燃机车担任外，山海关机务段的其余机车交路全部由东方红1型内燃机车担任，包括山海关站至沈阳站、北京站、彰武站的所有旅客列车。机车的架修、定修任务由山海关机务段担负，而厂修则是在沈阳机车车辆厂进行。东方红1型内燃机车经过长期的运用考验，机务部门普遍认为该型机车设计合理、维护简便，也很少发生故障。据山海关机务段的统计数字，1970年至1981年东方红1型机车的临修率为每十万公里3.3件，1979年至1981年的机破率仅为每十万公里0.007件。\n1987年3月，铁路部开始将东风4B型内燃机车配属给山海关机务段。鉴于当时沈阳铁路局所管辖的许多干线仍然采用蒸汽机车牵引，因此将淘汰下来的东方红1型内燃机车调往其他机务段使用，包括锦州机务段、梅河口机务段、通化机务段、通辽机务段等。1987年，通辽机务段配属30台东方红1型内燃机车，担当通霍铁路煤炭列车的牵引任务。1989年4月起，东方红1型机车配属通化机务段和临江机务折返段，投入鸭大铁路浑江站至临江站区段运用。同年，大连机务段配属东方红1型内燃机车，用于牵引金庄铁路、旅顺支线的客货列车，替换建设型蒸汽机车。1989年，东方红1型内燃机车正式全面退出沈山铁路，1998年，东方红1型内燃机车全部停运报废。\n## 技术特点\n### 总体布置\n东方红1型柴油机车是干线客运用的液力传动柴油机车，按照双机联挂运用条件设计，需要时也可单机使用。机车采用单司机室的桁架式侧壁承载车体，车体由底架、侧墙、端墙、车顶、车头等钢结构焊接而成。侧墙采用压根钢板制成以提高刚度。车体后端设有端门和通过台，以便双机连挂时供司机通行。\n司机室位于车体前端，当两台机车重联连挂使用时，可由任一机车的司机室操纵机车。4201～4204号机车采用整体圆弧过渡的流线型车头，前窗玻璃采用两块有机玻璃制成。4205号以后的量产车采用了重新设计的车头外形，结构和制造比原来的流线型车头简单，并在车体长度不变的条件下使司机室更加宽敞；前窗改用双层钢化玻璃以提高安全性，并加大了前窗和侧窗尺寸以便嘹望。\n动力室位于司机室后部，内装有两套完全相同、对称布置，而又相互独立的动力传动装置，亦可根据需要使用其中一套进行牵引作业，每套动力机组包括一台柴油机及一组液力传动装置。动力室内靠近车体中部位置设有散热器和冷却风扇，风扇由液力传动箱输出轴经万向轴驱动。除此之外，动力室内还装有空气压缩机、冷却水泵、辅助发电机、传动油热交换器、燃油滤清器、燃油预热器、预热锅炉等辅助设备。动力室车顶部分设有可拆式顶盖，以便检修和吊装柴油机等大型部件。燃油箱设置于车体下方两台转向架之间。4201～4204号机车在动力室尾端设有总风缸和厕所，而4205号以后的量产车则取消了厕所，总风缸移至车底。\n### 柴油机\n4201～4202号机车装用上海柴油机厂制造的12V175Z型柴油机，4203号机车装用从西德订购的梅赛德斯-奔驰MB 820 Bb型柴油机，4204～4274号机车大多装用四方机车车辆厂制造的12V175Z型柴油机，当中亦有少数机车装用上海柴油机厂制造的12V180Z柴油机。4275～4305号机车装用四方机车车辆厂制造的12V175ZL型柴油机。4306号机车装用四方机车车辆厂制造的12V180ZL型柴油机，用作线路试验。\n12V175Z型柴油机是上海柴油机厂、上海内燃机研究所、上海交通大学、无锡柴油机厂、无锡动力机厂于1959年共同试制的高速柴油机，这是中国研制国产高速大功率增压柴油机的开端。该型柴油机是仿制西德的梅赛德斯-奔驰MB 820 Bb型柴油机（即MTU MB 12 V 493型柴油机，被广泛应用于德国联邦铁路V200.0型柴油机车）。1961年，经国家经委协调，基本试制成功的12V175Z型柴油机转交铁道部四方机车车辆厂生产。12V175Z型柴油机为四冲程、12气缸、预燃室式、废气涡轮增压的V型高速柴油机，曲轴用铜钼合金球铁或全纤维锻造合金钢制成，采用废气涡轮脉冲增压系统，装用天津机车车辆机械厂生产的35GP602型增压器。气缸直径为175毫米，活塞行程为205毫米，气缸夹角为60°，额定转速为每分钟1500转，标定功率为1000马力（735千瓦）。在4201～4204号机车上的装车功率为1000马力，在4205号以后量产车为910马力。单位燃油消耗率为", "东方红1型内燃机车，原称卫星型内燃机车、NY1型内燃机车，是中国铁路使用的内燃机车车型之一，也是中国第一代液力传动内燃机车的代表车型。卫星型内燃机车是由青岛四方机车车辆厂于1958年开始设计、1959年试制成功的液力传动干线客运内燃机车，经过多次试验和改进后于1965年进行了整图和定型设计，于1966年定名为东方红1型内燃机车并投入批量生产，至1973年停产为止共生产106台。东方红1型内燃机车曾经配属北京机务段、广州机务段和灵丘机务段，1977年以后除了北京机务段留有5台机车用于专运外，其余机车全部集中配属于山海关机务段，成为当时京山铁路、沈山铁路的主力客运机车。于2001年退役。\n东方红1型内燃机车是采用双机组设计液力传动内燃机车，早期生产的机车装有两台910马力的12V175Z型四冲程高速柴油机（部分机车装用12V180Z型高速柴油机），机车构造速度为140公里/小时。从1968年生产的4275号机车开始改用两台1050马力的12V175ZL型柴油机，机车构造速度为120公里/小时。机车上并装有两套功率各为1000马力的SF3010-1型多循环圆式液力传动装置。\n东方红1型内燃机车被定为国家一级文物。该文物现收藏于中国铁道博物馆。\n\n## 发展历史\n\n### 开发背景\n\n1950年代，中国开始踏上铁路牵引动力内燃化和发展国产内燃机车的道路。1956年8月，由铁道部科学研究院编制的中国首个铁路科技发展规划——《1956年—1967年铁道科学技术发展远景规划》在全国铁道科学工作会议上讨论通过，指出“技术政策的中心环节是牵引动力改革，要迅速地、有步骤地由蒸汽机车转到电力机车和内燃机车上去”，从此确定了牵引动力改革的方向。1956年至1958年，第一机械工业部机车车辆研究所、铁道部铁道科学研究院展开一系列的课题研究，通过技术人员的培养和技术资料的研究，初步掌握了内燃机车的工作原理、设计方法和试验方法，完成了发展内燃机车的前期准备工作。\n1958年起，在大跃进运动形势的推动下，铁道部各主要机车制造和修理工厂纷纷掀起“争取生产内燃机车”的热潮，包括长辛店机车车辆工厂试制的建设型内燃机车、大连机车车辆工厂试制的巨龙型内燃机车、戚墅堰机车车辆工厂的先行型内燃机车。在上述这几种电力传动内燃机车当中，除了仿制苏联TE3型柴油机车的巨龙型机车以外，建设型和先行型机车都在动力与传动装置的配套上遇到了困难。由于中国当时动力机械工业的大型电机制造能力和技术水平还比较落后，无法提供与机车柴油机转速和功率相匹配的发电机，建设型和先行型机车只能在柴油机和发电机之间增设一个减速齿轮箱。四方机车车辆厂在着手设计时也遇到同样障碍后，根据“液力传动和电力传动并举”的方针，决定冒着风险采用液力传动技术。\n\n### 研制过程\n\n1958年6月，四方机车车辆厂与大连机车车辆研究所、上海交通大学、集宁机务段等组成联合设计组，开始研制东风型液力传动双层摩托列车。1958年7月8日，戚墅堰机车车辆厂与四方机车车辆厂、上海铁路局、上海交通大学、上海柴油机厂、无锡柴油机厂、上海电机厂等单位在上海成立了内燃机车协作组，经过协商后决定由戚墅堰工厂与上海交大、上海铁路局、无锡柴油机厂、上海电机厂等单位共同研制2000马力电力传动内燃机车（先行型），而四方工厂与上海柴油机厂等单位负责研制2000马力液力传动内燃机车（卫星型）。1958年7月18日，四方机车车辆厂完成了东风型摩托列车组的设计工作，并立即着手研制卫星型液力传动内燃机车。1958年10月，在大连机车车辆研究所、铁道部科学研究院、上海交通大学、北京工业学院等单位共同协作下，四方工厂完成了机车图纸设计并投入试制。\n1959年3月25日，大连机车车辆研究所负责设计试制的液力传动装置开始进行台架试验。1959年4月10日，第一台原型车在四方机车车辆厂试制成功，以具有大跃进时代色彩的“卫星型”命名，车型代号NY1，其中“N”代表内燃机车、“Y”代表液力传动、“1”代表第一种型号。卫星型机车是2000马力的液力传动干线客运内燃机车，许多方面均借鉴自当时手执液力传动技术牛耳的联邦德国（西德），尤其柴油机及传动装置参考了德国联邦铁路V200型柴油机车。机车装用两台1000马力的12V175型高速四冲程柴油机，由上海柴油机厂、上海内燃机研究所、上海交通大学、无锡动力机厂共同试制，是德国戴姆勒-奔驰MB 820 Bb型柴油机的仿制产品\n。而传动系统则采用了模仿福伊特的多循环圆液力传动装置。当时在关于液力传动装置型式结构的选用问题上曾经有一场争论，应选用福伊特的多循环圆结构还是迈巴赫的米基德罗型单循环圆复合式结构，由于福伊特多循环圆结构相对简单、维护方便，且换档时对牵引力影响较小，而最终决定采用福伊特型液力传动装置。\n1959年4月14日，卫星型机车（NY1-0001）在胶济铁路四方至蓝村之间进行第一次试运行；同年5月15日，机车完成第二次试运行后返厂解体检查，并对液力传动装置进行可靠性试验和各项改进。1959年5月至6月，全苏铁道运输科学研究院内燃机车研究所所长富弗良斯基（Н. А. Фуфрянский）访华，参加了TE1G型煤气内燃机车的试验总结及卫星型内燃机车的设计审查。同年6月初，四方机车车辆厂就卫星型机车的试制召开了会议，富弗良斯基发表讲话并指出中国研制液力传动内燃机车的速度出乎他的意料，不仅技术上达到了当时世界先进水平，而且培养了大批液力传动内燃机车设计与制造方面的技术人员。\n1959年10月国庆节期间，卫星型内燃机车与戚墅堰机车车辆工厂的先行型内燃机车、大连机车车辆工厂的巨龙型内燃机车、株洲机车车辆工厂的韶山型电力机车一同前往在北京展览馆展出，并于同年12月参加第二次全国工业交通展览会。1959年11月12日，时任全国人大常委会副委员长、中国科学院院长郭沫若前往北京环形铁道视察这几种新机车并亲自题诗祝贺：“电掣风驰今在眼，巨龙追逐卫星奔。韶山初见星星火，此日已经燎大原”  。在大跃进运动期间仓促上马的几种内燃机车，由于设计经验不足和制造工艺落后，这几种机车的性能和质量均不尽如人意。经过多年的试验改进后，只有巨龙型和卫星型得以定型并投入批量生产，也就是后来的东风型和东方红1型内燃机车。而建设型和先行型机车仅经过初步试验，而未能投入批量生产和正式使用。\n\n### 试验改进\n\n1960年，NY1-0001号机车已经试运行3600余公里，后来由于柴油机曲轴发生裂纹而中断试验。1961年，四方机车车辆厂根据第一台机车的试验结果，采用了经过改进的液力传动装置和中间齿轮箱等，试制了第二台卫星型机车（NY1-0002号机车）。NY1-0002号机车出厂后经过多次运行试验，最高试运速度达到100公里/小时（设计构造速度为140公里/小时，因受线路条件限制，没有试验更高速度），柴油机最大运用功率达800马力（设计为1000马力），液力传动装置效率达0.81（设计为0.86），虽然尚未完全达到设计指标，但机车运作情况良好\n。1961年至1962年期间，为了挽救大跃进造成的机车车辆大量失修的局面，铁道部要求机车车辆工厂“由造转修”，集中力量进行机车车辆养护维修工作，这段时间的内燃机车研制工作进展亦较为缓慢。\n1963年8月，随着铁路机车车辆失修状况开始有了明显好转，为了组织内燃机车和电力机车的生产会战，铁道部机车车辆工厂管理总局会同国家计委、国家经委、国家科委、一机部、三机部、五机部等部委，成立了“大功率牵引动力内燃化、电气化领导小组”，以解决内燃机车和电力机车的选型、定点、配套、协作等问题，目标是在两三年内达到批量生产的水平。同时，国家经委并将内燃机车和电力机车列为国家新产品试制重点项目。1963年9月，国家计委、国家科委、铁道部、铁科院的领导以及有关的主要工程技术人员等前往青岛，对四方机车车辆厂试制液力传动内燃机车的情况作了实地考察，并在胶济铁路青岛至济南区间参加了一次运行试验。考察结束后，领导小组向副总理薄一波、聂荣臻呈交的报告中，明确提出“首先应发展内燃牵引，而发展内燃牵引，必须在继续研究试制电力传动内燃机车的同时，大力研究试制液力传动内燃机车”。\n\n为了解决卫星型机车的柴油机供应问题，领导小组决定先从西德进口少量高速柴油机，以便在国产柴油机未定型生产前，使用进口柴油机试验液力传动装置及车体结构等；同时，加快四方机车车辆厂的12V175Z型柴油机的试制工作，为日后的生产做好准备；抓紧上海柴油机厂12V180Z型柴油机的定型工作，争取在1965年定型投产\n。1964年，四方机车车辆厂根据领导小组提出的机车选型方案，研制了红星型液力传动调车内燃机车，作为研制液力传动干线内燃机车的练兵产品。1965年，四方机车车辆厂建成了内燃机车综合试验台、大功率试验台和小功率试验台，并成功试制了工厂第一台12V175Z型柴油机\n。年内，四方机车车辆厂改进了卫星型机车的司机室钢结构和隔音减震装置，先后生产了NY1-0003、NY1-0004号两台卫星型机车，其中NY1-0003号机车装用了从西德订购的MB 820 Bb型柴油机，而NY1-0004号机车则装用四方机车车辆厂自己制造的12V175Z型柴油机。\n\n### 定型投产\n\n四方机车车辆厂对卫星型机车进行了多年的反复试验及改进之后，先后解决了液力传动装置换档不灵、油温过高、变矩器效率过低等问题，于1966年完成了第三次调整设计方案并上报铁道部要求鉴定。与此同时，文化大革命开始之后多种铁路机车都改取富有“革命”气息的名称，卫星型内燃机车亦改称为东方红1型内燃机车，自此掀开了中国铁路以“东方红”命名的液力传动内燃机车家族的生产历史。根据铁道部工业总局的指示，四方机车车辆厂于1966年下半年停止生产蒸汽机车，开始批量生产已定型的东方红1型内燃机车，机车车号序列从4205号开始，而之前生产的四台机车的车号也更改为4201～4204。1972年5月，随着新一代的东方红3型内燃机车研制成功，东方红1型内燃机车亦宣告停产。从1958年到1972年，四方机车车辆厂生产了共106台东方红1型内燃机车（4201～4306）。\n\n与在1966年之前试制的卫星型机车相比，正式定型的东方红1型机车在车体结构和传动装置都有所变化。动力装置主要采用四方机车车辆厂制造的12V175Z型柴油机，少量机车装用上海柴油机厂提供的12V180Z型柴油机；为了提高柴油机的可靠性和使用寿命，将柴油机最大运用功率由1000马力降至910马力。此外，又重新设计了司机室外形，取代了之前使用的流线型车头，既简化了结构和生产过程，又改善乘务员瞭望条件，同时令司机室空间更为宽敞\n。传动装置采用经过改进的SF3010-1型液力变速箱，当中的液力变扭器型号也在生产过程中经历多次变更。从1968年生产的4275号机车开始，又改用带中冷器的12V175ZL型柴油机，最大运用功率提高至1050马力，机车最高速度从140公里/小时降至120公里/小时。\n\n### 运用历史\n\n1966年9月，东方红1型4203号机车首先配属北京铁路局北京内燃机务段投入运用。1968年，锦州铁路局山海关机务段开始从蒸汽机车货运段向内燃机车客运段过渡，同年7月20日配属首批5台东方红1型机车，担当津山铁路的旅客列车牵引任务。1971年，北京机务段和山海关机务段的东方红1型机车配属数量已经分别达到29台、56台。从1970年代起至1980年代初，东方红1型内燃机车曾经是京山铁路、沈山铁路的主力客运机车，主要牵引北京至沈阳区段的旅客列车、国际列车以及领导人专列，通常采用双机联挂。\n1970年10月1日，广州铁路局广州机务段配属东方红1型机车，用于牵引广深铁路广州至深圳间的旅客列车，到1972年广州机务段配属东风型内燃机车后，东方红1型机车全部调往其他路局。1971年，随着京原铁路建成通车，太原铁路分局灵丘机务段投入使用，同年配属东方红1型机车3台，至1972年增加到9台，担当灵丘至原平间客货列车牵引任务\n。1976年，灵丘机务段增配新造的东风4型内燃机车，该段的东方红1型机车调往山海关机务段。\n1977年，北京机务段开始大量配属北京型内燃机车，除了用于牵引专列的5台机车仍然留在北京机务段，其余的东方红1型机车全部集中配属山海关机务段。截至1978年末，扣除已报废的6台机车（4201～4204、4209、4210），山海关机务段配属东方红1型机车共95台。当时，除了山海关至济南区间的三对交路由NY7型内燃机车担任外，山海关机务段的其余机车交路全部由东方红1型机车担任，包括山海关至沈阳、北京、彰武的所有旅客列车。机车的架修、定修任务由山海关机务段担负，而厂修则是在沈阳机车车辆厂进行。东方红1型机车经过长期的运用考验，机务部门普遍认为该型机车设计合理、维护简便，也很少发生故障。据山海关机务段的统计数字，1970年至1981年东方红1型机车的临修率为每十万公里3.3件，1979年至1981年的机破率仅为每十万公里0.007件。\n\n1987年3月，铁路部开始将东风4B型内燃机车配属给山海关机务段。鉴于当时沈阳铁路局所管辖的许多干线仍然采用蒸汽机车牵引，因此将淘汰下来的东方红1型机车调往其他机务段使用，包括锦州机务段、梅河口机务段、通化机务段、通辽机务段等。1987年，通辽机务段配属30台东方红1型机车，担当通霍铁路煤炭列车的牵引任务\n。1989年4月起，东方红1型机车配属通化机务段和临江机务折返段，投入鸭大铁路浑江至临江区段运用。同年，大连机务段配属东方红1型机车，用于牵引金城铁路、旅顺支线的客货列车，替换建设型蒸汽机车。1989年，东方红1型机车正式全面退出沈山铁路。1998年，东方红1型机车全部停运报废。\n\n## 技术特性\n\n### 总体布置\n\n东方红1型内燃机车是干线客运用的液力传动内燃机车，按照双机联挂运用条件设计，需要时也可单机使用。机车采用单司机室的桁架式侧壁承载车体，车体由底架、侧墙、端墙、车顶、车头等钢结构焊接而成。侧墙采用压根钢板制成以提高刚度。车体后端设有端门和通过台，以便双机连挂时供司机通行。\n司机室位于车体前端，当两台机车重联连挂使用时，可由任一机车的司机室操纵机车。4201～4204号机车采用整体圆弧过渡的流线型车头，前窗玻璃采用两块有机玻璃制成。4205号以后的量产车采用了重新设计的车头外形，结构和制造比原来的流线型车头简单，并在车体长度不变的条件下使司机室更加宽敞；前窗改用双层钢化玻璃以提高安全性，并加大了前窗和侧窗尺寸以便瞭望。\n动力室位于司机室后部，内装有两套完全相同、对称布置，而又相互独立的动力传动装置，亦可根据需要使用其中一套进行牵引作业，每套动力机组包括一台柴油机及一组液力传动装置。动力室内靠近车体中部位置设有散热器和冷却风扇，风扇由液力传动箱输出轴经万向轴驱动。除此之外，动力室内还装有空气压缩机、冷却水泵、辅助发电机、传动油热交换器、燃油滤清器、燃油预热器、预热锅炉等辅助设备。动力室车顶部分设有可拆式顶盖，以便检修和吊装柴油机等大型部件。燃油箱设置于车体下方两台转向架之间。4201～4204号机车在动力室尾端设有总风缸和厕所\n，而4205号以后的量产车则取消了厕所，总风缸移至车底。\n\n### 柴油机\n\n4201～4202号机车装用上海柴油机厂制造的12V175Z型柴油机，4203号机车装用从西德订购的梅赛德斯-奔驰MB 820 Bb型柴油机，4204～4274号机车大多装用四方机车车辆厂制造的12V175Z型柴油机，当中亦有少数机车装用上海柴油机厂制造的12V180Z柴油机。4275～4305号机车装用四方机车车辆厂制造的12V175ZL型柴油机。4306号机车装用四方机车车辆厂制造的12V180ZL型柴油机，用作线路试验。\n12V175Z型柴油机是上海柴油机厂、上海内燃机研究所、上海交通大学、无锡柴油机厂、无锡动力机厂于1959年共同试制的高速柴油机，这是中国研制国产高速大功率增压柴油机的开端。该型柴油机是仿制西德的梅赛德斯-奔驰MB 820 Bb型柴油机（即MTUMB 12 V 493型柴油机，被广泛应用于德国联邦铁路V200.0型柴油机车）。1961年，经国家经委协调，基本试制成功的12V175Z型柴油机转交铁道部四方机车车辆厂生产\n。12V175Z型柴油机为四冲程、12气缸、预燃室式、废气涡轮增压的V型高速柴油机，曲轴用铜钼合金球铁或全纤维锻造合金钢制成，采用废气涡轮脉冲增压系统，装用天津机车车辆机械厂生产的35GP602型增压器。气缸直径为175毫米，活塞行程为205毫米，气缸夹角为60°，额定转速为每分钟1500转，标定功率为1000马力（735千瓦）。在4201～4204号机车上的装车功率为1000马力，在4205号以后量产车为910马力。单位燃油消耗率为<175克/有效马力·小时。\n12V175ZL型柴油机是由四方机车车辆厂在12V175Z型柴油机基础上，加装增压空气中间冷却器（中冷器），使柴油机平均有效压力由996kPa提升至1010kPa，装车功率提高至1050马力（735千瓦）。\n\n12V180Z型柴油机是由上海柴油机厂设计制造的高速柴油机，仿制自苏联的М-50 Ф-3型柴油机，于1962年10月试制成功、1965年投入批量生产\n。12V180Z型柴油机为四冲程、12气缸、涡轮增压的V型高速柴油机，气缸直径180毫米，活塞行程205毫米，额定转速为每分钟1500转，标定功率为1000马力（735千瓦），装车功率为910马力。\n12V180ZL型柴油机是因应援助坦赞铁路需要，由四方机车车辆厂设计制造，以上海柴油机厂的12V180型船用柴油机为基础，于1969年研制成功的高速柴油机，应用于援助坦赞铁路的DFH1、DFH2型内燃机车，以及用于国内的东方红3型内燃机车。该型柴油机为四冲程、12气缸、预燃室式、涡轮增压、带中冷器的V型高速柴油机，气缸直径180毫米，活塞行程205毫米，额定转速为每分钟1500转。\n\n### 传动系统\n\n东方红1型内燃机车采用双机组设计，每套传动装置由液力变速箱、中间齿轮箱、车轴齿轮箱、万向轴等部件组成。柴油机发出的功率通过第一万向轴输入液力变速箱，然后扭矩从液力变速箱的下部输出法兰，经第二万向轴输入设于转向架中部的中间齿轮箱，再从中间齿轮箱的两端输出，将扭矩经第三、四万向轴传送给前后两个车轴齿轮箱，从而驱动轮对并产生牵引力。\n\n液力变速箱通过螺栓安装在与车架相连的安装架上，采用仿福伊特的多循环圆式结构，内装有一个起动变扭器（第一变扭器）和两个结构相同的运转变扭器（第二、三变扭器）。柴油机的功率经输入轴输入，经增速齿轮驱动泵轮轴，泵轮轴上安装有三个变扭器的泵轮。由于第一和第二变扭器的高效区互相衔接，因此其涡轮用空心轴连接在一起，并共用一个减速齿轮输出。第三变扭器的涡轮有单独一个输出齿轮。\n在东方红1型机车的试制和生产过程中，液力传动装置也经过了多次改进。4201～4204号机车使用SF3010型液力变速箱，其中4201～4202号机车使用B3型起动变扭器和B4型运转变扭器\n，司机以电—风遥控进行手动换档。4203～4204号机车使用B5型起动变扭器\n和B4型运转变扭器，采用离心式自动换档装置。\n从4205号机车开始则改用SF3010-1型液力变速箱，主要变化包括调整了变速箱控制阀位置，换向机构以风动合齿机构取代变扭器微量充油等。变扭器型号经历了多次转变，传动效率亦日渐提高，先后使用过B5、B7、B8型起动变扭器\n，以及B4、B9、B10型运转变扭器。\n\n### 转向架\n\n机车走行部为两台二轴转向架。转向架构架采用H字形的钢板焊接结构。车轴轴箱采用双拉杆定位结构，轴箱通过装有橡胶关节元件的上、下轴箱拉杆与构架相连接，实现轴箱相对于构架的横向和纵向定位。轴箱内装有两列滚柱轴承。转向架构架侧梁上设有滚柱式弹性旁承装置，车体全部重量通过八个旁承由两台转向架支承，抛弃了传统的摇枕悬挂装置，提高了转向架横向稳定性。\n弹簧悬挂装置分为一系和二系悬挂两部分。一系悬挂为轴箱与构架之间的轴箱圆弹簧。二系悬挂为置于旁承之下的四组圆弹簧，并车体和构架之间还配有垂向液压减震器。由于转向架中部设有中间齿轮箱，无法设置心盘，因此东方红1型机车采用了由牵引杆、肘形杠杆及侧承装置组成的牵引杆系统来传递牵引力，并形成转向架的假想转动中心\n。基础制动方式为双侧铸铁闸瓦踏面制动，转向架的每侧车轮各有一个制动缸，分别驱动两侧各自的杠杆传动机构。\n传动装置使用SF3010-1型液力传动箱；柴油机发出功率后，通过第一万向轴输入液力变速箱，通过液力变矩器改变机车速度与牵引力，经中间齿轮箱、车轴齿轮箱传递扭矩至车轴，带动轮对。机车走行部为两台二轴转向架，为无心盘、导框式、H型焊接式构架转向架。一系悬挂为独立圆簧，二系悬挂为置于旁承之下的四组圆簧，转向架通过牵引杆与车体相连并传递牵引力。\n\n## 事故\n\n1982年5月28日下午4时05分，锦州铁路局锦州铁路分局山海关机务段的东方红1型机车，双机重联牵引由济南开往佳木斯的193次直通旅客快车（今K1392/1393、K1394/1391次列车），当列车行驶至沈山铁路兴隆店站（距离沈阳43公里）时，发生列车颠覆重大事故，造成2台机车、7辆客车脱轨颠覆，当场死亡3人、重伤20人、轻伤127人；东方红1型机车报废1台、大破1台；客车报废4辆、大破3辆、小破2辆、守车报废1辆，破坏线路600米、道岔两组、各种轨枕666根，报废电动转辙机3台、调车信号机3架，沈山线下行中断行车19小时45分，直接经济损失171万余元人民币。这次事故的直接原因是锦州铁路局大虎山工务段兴隆店养路工区工人在该处做无缝线路修补作业时，违反劳动纪律和操作规程，擅自将起道机立放在钢轨内侧后撤离岗位，到距离作业地点五米远的道口看守房去吃冰棍，当193次列车通过时撞上起道机，导致列车脱轨颠覆。\n\n## 车辆保存\n\n东方红1型4290号机车：于1971年6月出厂，随后配属锦州铁路局山海关机务段，投入京山、沈山铁路运用。1980年代末转配通化机务段，至1993年又调至通辽机务段，1996年根据铁道部电报退役。退役后不久又被调至沈阳铁路局苏家屯车辆段作段内调车机车使用，至2000年代初停用报废。2005年7月，辽宁一位铁路爱好者去信中国铁道部反映这台机车境况堪忧、面临拆解，建议铁道部有关部门对这两台机车给予妥善保护，并送交中国铁道博物馆收藏。2006年4月，经过铁道部运输局、中国铁道博物馆、沈阳铁路局合作对机车进行整修后，这台机车终于恢复了原来的面貌\n。2007年12月15日，东方红1型4290号机车从沈阳运抵北京，成为中国铁道博物馆机车车辆展厅的永久藏品  ，经鉴定后被评定为国家一级文物。\n\n东方红1型4222号机车：曾经配属山海关机务段，于2009年开始在沈阳铁路机车陈列馆展出。\n\n## 技术数据\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 华氏轮式 | 0-4-4-0 |\n| UIC轴式 | Bo-Bo |\n| 轨距 | 1,435毫米 |\n| 轮径 | 1,050毫米 |\n| 轴重 | 21吨 |\n| 整备重量

{"name": "黄金比例", "documents": ["黄金比例是一个定义为 (√5-1)/2的无理数。 所被运用到的层面相当的广阔，例如：数学、物理、建筑、美术甚至是音乐。 黄金比例的独特性质首先被应用在分割一条线段上。如果有一条线段的总长度为黄金比例的 分母加分子的单位长，若我们把它分割为两半，长的为分母单位长度，短的为分子单位长度 则短线长度与长线长度的比值即为黄金比例。\n黄金比例（以下简称“黄金比”）约为： 0.618:1\n\n## 含义\n\n把一条线段分割为两部分，较短部分与较长部分长度之比等于较长部分与整体长度之比，其比值是一个无理数，取其前三位数字的近似值是0.618。由于按此比例设计的造型十分美丽，因此称为黄金比例，也称为中外比。这是一个十分有趣的数字，我们以0.618来近似，通过简单的计算就可以发现：\n0.618/1=0.618\n1/(1+0.618)=0.618\n这个数值的作用不仅仅存在于诸如绘画、雕塑、音乐、建筑等艺术领域，而且在管理、工程设计等方面也有着不可忽视的作用。\n让我们首先从一个数列开始，它的前面几个数是：1、1、2、3、5、8、13、21、34、55、89、144…..这个数列的名字叫做\"菲波那契数列\"，这些数被称为\"菲波那契数\"。特点是即除前两个数（数值为1）之外，每个数都是它前面两个数之和。\n斐波那契数列与黄金分割有什么关系呢？经研究发现，相邻两个菲波那契数的比值是随序号的增加而逐渐趋于黄金分割比的。即f(n)/f(n-1)-1→0.618…。由于菲波那契数都是整数，两个整数相除之商是有理数，所以只是逐渐逼近黄金分割比这个无理数。但是当我们继续计算出后面更大的菲波那契数时，就会发现相邻两数之比确实是非常接近黄金分割比的。\n一个很能说明问题的例子是五角星/正五边形。五角星是非常美丽的，我国的国旗上就有五颗，还有不少国家的国旗也用五角星，这是为什么？因为在五角星中可以找到的所有线段之间的长度关系都是符合黄金分割比的。正五边形对角线连满后出现的所有三角形，都是黄金分割三角形。\n由于五角星的顶角是36度，这样也可以得出黄金分割的数值为2Sin18°\n黄金分割点约等于0．618：1\n是指分一线段为两部分，使得原来线段的长跟较长的那部分的比为黄金分割的点。线段上有两个这样的点。\n利用线段上的两黄金分割点，可作出正五角星，正五边形。\n2000多年前,古希腊雅典学派的第三大算学家欧道克萨斯首先提出黄金分割。所谓黄金分割，指的是把长为L的线段分为两部分，使其中一部分对于全部之比，等于另一部分对于该部分之比。而计算黄金分割最简单的方法，是计算斐波契数列1，1，2，3，5，8，13，21，...后二数之比2/3,3/5,5/8,8/13,13/21,...近似值的。\n其实有关\"黄金分割\"，我国也有记载。虽然没有古希腊的早，但它是我国古代数学家独立创造的，后来传入了印度。经考证。欧洲的比例算法是源于我国而经过印度由阿拉伯传入欧洲的，而不是直接从古希腊传入的。\n因为它在造型艺术中具有美学价值，在工艺美术和日用品的长宽设计中，采用这一比值能够引起人们的美感，在实际生活中的应用也非常广泛，建筑物中某些线段的比就科学采用了黄金分割，舞台上的报幕员并不是站在舞台的正中央，而是偏在台上一侧，以站在舞台长度的黄金分割点的位置最美观，声音传播的最好。就连植物界也有采用黄金分割的地方，如果从一棵嫩枝的顶端向下看，就会看到叶子是按照黄金分割的规律排列着的。在很多科学实验中，选取方案常用一种0.618法，即优选法，它可以使我们合理地安排较少的试验次数找到合理的配方和合适的工艺条件。正因为它在建筑、文艺、工农业生产和科学实验中有着广泛而重要的应用，所以人们才称它为\"黄金分割\"。\n\n## 主要特点\n\n黄金比例是一种数学上的比例关系。黄金比例具有严格的比例性、艺术性、和谐性，蕴藏着丰富的美学价值。应用时一般取0.618 ，就像圆周率在应用时取3.14一样。\n黄金矩形(Golden Rectangle)的长宽之比为黄金分割率,换言之,矩形的长边为短边 1.618倍.黄金分割率和黄金矩形能够给画面带来美感,令人愉悦.在很多艺术品以及大自然中都能找到它.希腊雅典的帕撒神农庙就是一个很好的例子.而达·芬奇的《维特鲁威人》符合黄金矩形.《蒙娜丽莎》中蒙娜丽莎的脸也符合黄金矩形，《最后的晚餐》同样也应用了该比例布局。\n\n## 黄金分割\n\n黄金分割是一个古老的数学方法。\n对它的各种神奇的作用和魔力，数学上还没有明确的解释，只是发现它屡屡在实际中发挥我们意想不到的作用。\n做一个直角三角形ABC,直边AC的长度是直边BC的一半，以A为圆心，AC为半径，做圆交AB于D,以B为圆心，BD为半径做圆交BC于E，BE与BC之比即为黄金分割。比值可计算出，为\n[5^(1/2)-1]/2≈0.618\n此外，还有另一种使用黄金分割线的方法就是两点黄金分割线。\n选择最高点和 最低点(局部的)，以 这个区间作为全长，然后在此基础上作黄金分割线，进行计算出反弹高度和回荡高度。这个黄金分割线实际上是百分比线的一个特殊情况。\n黄金分割奇妙之处，在于其比例与其倒数是一样的。例如：1.618的倒数是0.618，而1.618:1与1:0.618是一样的。确切值为(√5-1)/2，黄金分割数是无理数。\n\n## 发现历史\n\n由于公元前6世纪古希腊的毕达哥拉斯学派研究过正五边形和正十边形的作图，因此现代数学家们推断当时毕达哥拉斯学派已经触及甚至掌握了黄金分割。\n公元前4世纪，古希腊数学家欧多克索斯第一个系统研究了这一问题，并建立起比例理论。\n公元前300年前后欧几里得撰写《几何原本》时吸收了欧多克索斯的研究成果，进一步系统论述了黄金分割，成为最早的有关黄金分割的论著。\n黄金分割在文艺复兴前后，经过阿拉伯人传入欧洲，受到了欧洲人的欢迎，他们称之为\"金法\"，17世纪欧洲的一位数学家，甚至称它为\"各种算法中最可宝贵的算法\"。这种算法在印度称之为\"三率法\"或\"三数法则\"，也就是我们常说的比例方法。\n中世纪后，黄金分割被披上神秘的外衣，意大利数家帕乔利称中末比为神圣比例，并专门为此著书立说。德国天文学家开普勒称黄金分割为神圣分割。\n到19世纪黄金分割这一名称才逐渐通行。黄金分割数有许多有趣的性质，人类对它的实际应用也很广泛。最著名的例子是优选学中的黄金分割法或0.618法，是由美国数学家基弗于1953年首先提出的，70年代在中国推广。\n|..........a...........|\n+-------------+--------+ -\n| | | .\n| | | .\n| B | A | b\n| | | .\n| | | .\n| | | .\n+-------------+--------+ -\n|......b......|..a-b...|\n通常用希腊字母 表示这个值。\n\n## 应用领域\n\n### 股市领域\n\n在这里，我们将说明如何得到黄金分割线，并根据它们指导下一步的买卖股票 的操作。\n黄金分割线分为两种:单点的黄金分割线和两点黄金分割线.\n以下就是方法：画单点有两个因素（一是黄金数字，二是最高或最低点）\n画黄金分割线的第一步是记住若干个特殊的数字：\n0.191 0.382 0.618 0.809\n1.191 1.382 1.618 1.809\n2.191 2.382 2.618 2.809\n这些数字中0.382,0.618,1.382,1.618最为重要，股价极容易在由这4个数产生 的黄金分割线处产生支撑和压力。\n第二步是找到一个点。这个点是上升行情结束，调头向下的最高点，或者是下 降行情结束，调头向上的最低点。当然，我们知道这里的高点和低点都是指一 定的范围，是局部的。只要我们能够确认一趋势(无论是上升还是下降)已经结 束或暂时结束，则这个趋势的转折点就可以作为进行黄金分割的点。这个点一 经选定，我们就可以画出黄金分割线了。\n在上升行情开始调头向下时，我们极为关心这次下落将在什么位置获得支撑。 黄金分割提供的是如下几个价位。它们是由这次上涨的顶点价位分别乘上上面 所列的几个特殊数字中的几个。假设，这次上涨的顶点是10元，则\n8.09=10×0.809\n6.18=10×0.618\n3.82=10×0.382\n1.91=10×0.191\n这几个价位极有可能成为支撑，其中6.18和3.82的可能性最大。\n同理，在下降行情开始调头向上时，我们关心上涨到什么位置将遇到压力。黄 金分割线提供的位置是这次下跌的底点价位乘上上面的特殊数字。假设，这次 下落的谷底价位为10元，则\n11.91=10×1.191 21.91=10×2.191\n13.82=10×1.382 23.82=10×2.382\n16.18=10×1.618 26.18=10×2.618\n18.09=10×1.809 28.09=10×2.809\n20=10×2\n将可能成为未来的压力位。其中13.82和16.18以及20元成为压力线的可能性最 大,超过20的那几条很少用到。\n\n### 数学应用\n\n数字0.618…更为数学家所关注，它的出现，不仅解决了许多数学难题(如：十等分、五等分圆周；求18度、36度角的正弦、余弦值等)，而且还使优选法成为可能。优选法是一种求最优化问题的方法。如在炼钢时需要加入某种化学元素来增加钢材的强度，假设已知在每吨钢中需加某化学元素的量在1000—2000克之间，为了求得最恰当的加入量，需要在1000克与2000克这个区间中进行试验。通常是取区间的中点(即1500克)作试验。然后将试验结果分别与1000克和2000克时的实验结果作比较，从中选取强度较高的两点作为新的区间，再取新区间的中点做试验，再比较端点，依次下去，直到取得最理想的结果。这种实验法称为对分法。但这种方法并不是最快的实验方法，如果将实验点取在区间的0.618处，那么实验的次数将大大减少。这种取区间的0.618处作为试验点的方法就是一维的优选法，也称0.618法。实践证明，对于一个因素的问题，用“0.618法”做16次试验就可以完成“对分法”做2500次试验所达到的效果。因此大画家达·芬奇把0.618…称为黄金数。\n\n### 生活应用\n\n生活中，对“黄金分割”有着很多的应用。\n16:10显示器正是黄金比例应用在工业设计上的体现。商家们一直宣称16:9显示器是黄金比例，16:9显示器长与高的比值为1.78，而16:10显示器长高比值为1.6，很显然，16:10显示器更接近黄金比例，是真正的黄金比例屏。\n\n### 人体美学\n\n有趣的是，这个数字在自然界和人们生活中到处可见：人们的肚脐是人体总长的黄金分割点，人的膝盖是肚脐到脚跟的黄金分割点。\n艺术创作\n大多数门窗的宽长之比也是0.618…，有些植茎上，两张相邻叶柄的夹角是137度28'，这恰好是把圆周分成1:0.618……的两条半径的夹角。据研究发现，这种角度对植物通风和采光效果最佳。\n建筑师们对数字0.618…特别偏爱，无论是古埃及的金字塔，还是法国的巴黎圣母院，或者是近世纪的法国埃菲尔铁塔，都有与0.618…有关的数据。人们还发现，一些名画、雕塑、摄影作品的主题，大多在画面的0.618…处。艺术家们认为弦乐器的琴马放在琴弦的0.618…处，能使琴声更加柔和甜美。"],

）所唱之咒文及其注解等之集成。所传有二种：（一）黑夜柔吠陀（梵Kr!s!n!a -yajur-veda ），意指与梵书之区别不甚分明之吠陀。乃合糅吠陀之本文（赞歌、祭祠、咒词等）及梵书（吠陀之注书）所成，计四卷（或五卷、七卷、八卷）。（二）白夜柔吠陀（梵S/ukla -yajur-veda ），意指与梵书可以明白区分之吠陀。## 简介\n\n夜柔吠陀是印度古代《吠陀》文献中的一部，全名《夜柔吠陀本集》，是\n讲祭祀的书。“夜柔”的意思就是祭祀。有两种本子，篇幅大小不同。一是“黑”本，一是“白”本。“黑”本有经文，并附有说明；“白”本只有经文。“黑”本现有四派传本，“白”本现只有一派的两个传本。一般认为“白”本的年代比“黑”本晚。“白”本分为40章，有将近2，000节经文，包括诗和散文。诗多半从《梨俱吠陀》中摘出，作祷词用。散文是各种祭祀的经文的解说。“黑”本经文只有“白”本的前18章。一般认为第25章以后是晚出的部分。\n\n## 吠陀介绍\n\n### 意义\n\n《吠陀》是印度最占的义献，在印度被视为圣典。《吠陀》是知识、学问的意思。吠陀有四部本集。继四部吠陀之后，还有《梵书》、《森林书》、《奥义书》以及一些经书。一般把它们看作吠陀本集的续编，是传授吠陀本集的各个派别编订的，都与“吠陀本集”有关。\n\n### 组成\n\n《吠陀》的四部本集是《梨俱吠陀本集》、《娑摩吠陀本集》、《夜柔吠陀本集》和《阿达婆吠陀本集》。《梨俱吠陀本集》又名《赞诵明论本集》，包括一千多首诗，被视为天书而加以尊敬。它的编订年代大约在公元前1500年左右，比其他三部吠陀都早。\n\n### 内容\n\n其内容非常复杂，多半是赞颂火神阿耆尼、战神囚陀罗、苏摩酒、太阳神苏尔耶、晓天神邬霞、水神伐楼拿和死神阎摩的。此外，也有反映自然界和现实生活以及祭祀、巫术的内容。《 摩吠陀本集》又名《歌咏明论本集》，包括1875节歌词。这些歌词，在祭祀时可配曲演唱，除99节外，其余大部分是从《梨俱吠陀》中摘抄而来，或内容大体相同。《夜柔吠陀本集》又名《祭祀明论本集》，有两种本子，即《白祭祀明论》（白论）和《黑祭祀明论》（黑论）。《白论》包括1975节经文，用诗体或散文体写成，系各种祭祀用文。《黑论》与《白论》内容大同小异，只是《黑论》比《白论》的经文少些。《阿达婆吠陀本集》又名《禳灾明论本集》，也是一部诗集，据说为古仙阿达婆所传，因此得名。全书共有诗731首，多系咒语，现存的传本分为20卷，前7卷是短诗，其余各卷有的是长诗，有的大部分是散文。从内容上看，有的内容狭隘，思想腐朽，但有不少诗与生活、生产有关，反映了人民同自然界斗争和战胜敌人的信心与决心，以及对生活的乐观精神等等。这四部本集各有用途，《梨俱吠陀本集》是诵者咏诵的，《娑摩吠陀本集》是歌者唱的，《夜柔吠陀本集》是行祭者口中念的，而《阿达婆吠陀本集》是祭祀的监督者们所必须精通的。因为这些吠陀是三十几百年以前一直到两千几百年以前的古书，所以人们通常称这些书中所表现的时代为“吠陀时代”。这四种本集虽然都是为社会实践和一定阶级利益而编订的，有其社会意义和社会目的，但随着社会的发展，祭祀的作用日益减少，专为祭祀用的《娑摩吠陀》和《夜柔吠陀》也就成了过时的东西，而《梨俱吠陀》和《阿达婆吠陀》仍然放射着它们不朽的光彩。但这四部吠陀都是很重要的社会史料。\n\n##

梵书\n\n为传授《吠陀》，各派婆罗门还编订了一些文献，称为《梵书》。《梵书》主要记载举行祭祀的规定、仪式及风俗习惯等，是对本集的解释和说明，另外还有许多繁琐的讨论。虽然《梵书》中有许多神秘主义的枯燥说教，但也有不少神话传说，而且散文体也从此发展起来，所以在文学发展史中有它一定的地位。最著名的《梵书》有《百道梵书》、《爱达罗氏梵书》等。继各派《梵书》之后是各派的《森林书》，或译《阿兰若书》，是梵书的续编。据说只在森林中秘密传授。书中虽不讲如何进行祭祀了，但却发展厂神秘主义的理论。现存的《森林书》有《广森林书》、《鹧鸪氏森林书》、《他氏森林书》等。\n\n### 奥义书\n\n《奥义书》又发展了祭祀理论中的神秘主义。《奥义书》系梵文词，音译为《乌婆尼沙昙》，是吠陀圣典的最后一部分，所以又称《吠檀多》，即“吠陀的终结”。《奥义书》的主要内容是些神秘主义的说教和一些哲学著作，不少地方解译了生、死、灵魂、天地等宇宙论和人生观。《奥义书》中较古部分开始提出的“梵”和“我”的哲学问题和理论，后来大有发展。这些唯心主义派别总称“吠檀多派”，在近现代的印度和西方均有广泛传播。各派《奥义书》很多，大概有100多部，其中较古的大约有13部。最著名的《奥义书》有《歌者奥义书》和《广林奥义书》等。\n\n### 孝经礼记\n\n与“吠陀”有关的还有经书。大约是公元前5世纪至公元2世纪间的产物，相当于印度的《孝经》与《礼记》。经书又分三类，一是《所闻经》，是一般祭祀仪式的提要，记述祭祀的规定及祭把的做法；二是《家宅经》，讲的是一般节日庆祝和日常礼仪规定，说明家庭里举行的生死婚丧等礼仪；三是《法经》，它讲的是社会上各种人应该遵守的风俗习惯和法律，后来发展成各派的法典。\n\n### 吠陀支\n\n除上述外，还有与吠陀有关的其他书，和经书统称为“吠陀支”，是研究吠陀的辅助著作，通常把它们分为六支。上述的经书为一支，讲的是祭祀、礼仪、风俗习惯及法律规定，称为礼法学。另外五支分别有语言学，是讲吠陀诗歌的读法，里面有一些关于语音和语调的规定；语法学，是讲解语法的；词源学，是讲词的产生和派生的；诗律学，是讲诗的韵律和结构知识的；天文学，是讲太阳、月亮、火星、木星、金星、土星等如何运行的，速度如何，这都是天文学的内容，要准确地理解吠陀咒语中提到的星座，必需有一定的天文知识。\n\n### 吠陀集成\n\n吠陀是口头创作，最早的本集约在公元前15世纪，最晚的在公元前5世纪左右就形成了。在婆罗门祭司把这些长期积累的文献编订成集之前，它们一直被当作圣典，世世代代师徒口头相传。到后来，虽然有了刻写在棕榈叶或树皮上的写本，但主要仍靠口头传授。这一传统直到19世纪开始印刷这些古书时，仍未断绝，现存的传本基本上保留了古代原来的面貌。尽管《吠陀》不一定全是当时的实录，是僧侣口传下来的，其间当然会有不少是僧侣捏造的，但是它反映了公元前印度社会与文化情况，仍不愧为是重要的文化遗产，它不仅对了解印度上古时期的社会文化和民族风情等都具有很重要的史料价值，而且一直被后人视为圣典，影响着人们生活。同时，为后来的语言学、历史学、人类学、社会学、宗教、哲学、文学及天文学等的发展历史提供了重要的资料，大大丰富了世界文化的宝库。\n\n## 吠陀本集\n\n梨俱吠陀是雅利安人带来印度的，到了印度之后，雅利安人又完成了两部《吠陀本集》，一部叫《娑摩吠陀》(Sama-veda)；一部叫《夜柔吠陀》 (Yajur-veda)。《娑摩吠陀》除了七十五个颂子之外完全是取自《梨俱吠陀》，只是重新编排了一下，使之便于吟唱，“娑摩”就是歌的意思。《夜柔吠陀》里边有一些新的东西，主要是祭祀，“夜柔”就是祭祀的意思，它是在祭礼时念诵的祭词，多是散文体。这部祭祀典籍的出现是非常重要的，以祭祀为主体的吠陀宗教逐步形成了，在这里祭祀的目的就是讨神欢心，从而获得神的恩宠。在三部《吠陀本集》里面出现了很多的神，他们中最重要的一位神叫因陀罗神，是一位战神、闪电之神，雅利安人就祭祀这位神，让这位神庇护他们，保佑他们去打仗，去扩充自己的疆土。因陀罗神还有一个名字叫“城市摧毁者”，雅利安人认为，就是在因陀罗神的护佑下他们占领了很多城市，打败了很多民族，悦神得利益是早期吠陀祭祀宗教的目的。这三部《吠陀本集》，在佛经里佛陀提过，叫《三明》。 “吠陀”这个词的词根是“vid”，意思是知道、明白；“Veda”的本意就是“知识”，所以可以译作“明”。在《阿含经》里佛陀批评《三明》就是批评这三本书。也就是说，在公元前一千八百年左右，从印度的西北方来了一支好战的游牧民族，他们给印度带来了一个新的宗教，带来了一种新的语言，而且他们统治了印度。\n\n## 梵的概念\n\n雅利安人进入印度七、八百年之后，也就是在公元前一千年左右，出现了对三部《吠陀本集》注解的著作叫《梵书》(Brahmana)，这是一部论文集，其中最著名的是一部解释《夜柔吠陀》的 《梵书》叫《百道梵书》 (Satapatha)。在《梵书》中第一次明确地提出了“梵”(Brahman中性)的概念，梵是至高无上的；梵不是某个具体的神，诸如因陀罗、阿耆尼 (Agni，火神)等；它是诸神背后的推动力，是抽象出的终极真实。这个富有哲学意味的概念的提出是否是受到非雅利安土著思想影响的结果，我们还无法得知。早期的吠陀祭祀是单纯地取悦于神，到了《梵书》时代，由于“梵”这个概念的提出，雅利安人的祭祀发生了重大的变化。祭祀的内容被提升了，它不再是单纯地祭祀某个神了，并且阐释出许多祭祀的神圣意义。祭祀就是祭祀；利益就是从祭祀仪式本身得到；祭祀本身就有无上的功德，这似乎从有神走向了无神。\n\n## 划分等级\n\n到《梵书》时代，祭祀仪式变得越来越复杂了，祭祀活动必须由专业人士来进行了，因此一个专门从事祭祀的社会阶层——婆罗门(Brahman阳性)产生了。可以说到了这个时候，一个真正意义的雅利安宗教在印度诞生了，这个宗教就是婆罗门教。婆罗门教有三条根本的信条，第一是“《吠陀》天启”，《吠陀》是上天启示的，不是人传的；第二是“祭祀万能”；第三是“婆罗门至上”，从事祭祀的这个社会阶层是地位最高的。婆罗门教诞生之后，雅利安人把社会划分了等级 ——种姓(Varna)，婆罗门种姓是最高的等级，从事祭祀活动；第二个等级是刹帝利(Ksatriya)种姓，是军政阶层；第三个等级是吠舍 (Vaisya)种姓，是工商阶层。婆罗门种姓一定是雅利安人；刹帝利种姓和吠舍种姓是以雅利安人为主体，但是里边有非雅利安人；释迦牟尼是刹帝利种姓，而且是刹帝利阶层中的非雅利安人种，这是经过很多学者考证了的；第四个等级是首陀罗(Sudra)种姓，是从事低级劳动的普通民众；在第四等级之外还有更低下的，叫做“不可接触者”。作为崇尚武力、传承父权文化的雅利安人，他们不仅倡导等级秩序，而且鼓吹男尊女卑。视婆罗门信仰为正统的印度社会，其中有些内容竟然和我们中国的三从四德不谋而合，要求女人小的时候要听从父亲的；成年之后要听从丈夫的；等到老了、丈夫去世了，就要听从儿子的，反正女人自己是没有自主权的。印度时兴火葬，丈夫去世了，还有女人要跟着一起陪葬烧死，而且还把这种行为当作妇女的美德加以宣传和赞美，这是非常残酷的。", "## 夜柔吠陀\n夜柔吠陀（Yajurveda），梵文是由yajus（「祭祀」）和veda（「知识」）两个字根构成的复合词，汉译为祭祀明论，是印度教四大吠陀经之第三部。内容著重于礼拜及牲礼等的宗教仪式。\n夜柔吠陀主要分为两卷集著：白夜柔吠陀以及黑夜柔吠陀（“白”是指本文与释文区分清楚，“黑”是指本文与释文分辨不清）。两者都包含宗教仪式的必要韵文，后者却额外包含仪式的注解散文与施行细则，而这散文也开梵语散文体裁之先河。"],

{"name": "元亨利贞", "documents": ["## 元亨利贞\n元亨利贞是《周易》乾卦的卦辞，历来解释不一：\n《易干·文言》：“元者善之长也，亨者嘉之会也，利者义之和也，贞者事之干也。”\n据孔颖达疏：“《子夏传》云：元，始也；亨，通也；利，和也；贞，正也。言此卦之德，有纯阳之性，自然能以阳气始生万物，而得元始、亨通；能使物性和谐，各有其利；又能使物坚固贞正而终。”\n故由此有人认为「元亨利贞」是指代「春、夏、秋、冬」，即四季。", "元亨利贞，是乾卦之四德。通常认为语出《易经》乾卦的卦辞，原文“干，元亨利贞。”实际在《易经》全文中，这个四字组合出现了相当多次。“元亨利贞”，往往被解释为：“元，始也；亨，通也；利，和也；贞，正也。言此卦之德，有纯阳之性，自然能以阳气始生万物，而得元始、亨通，能使物性和谐，各有其利，又能使物坚固贞正得终。”\n自《易传》起，古人释此四字，大都一字一义，认为代表了乾卦的四种基本性质，往往引申为四季、四德等等，各家之言不一而足。如“元”，为大、为始，引义为善长，为春；“亨”为通，引义为嘉会，为夏。“利”为美利，引义为义和，为秋，“贞”为正，引义为干事，为冬。\n\n## 语句出处\n\n元亨利贞，语出《周易·干》，《周易·干·彖》说：“大哉乾元，万物资始，乃统天。云行雨施，品物流行……乾道变化，各正性命，保合太和，乃利贞。”《周易·干·文言》说：“元者，善之长也，亨者，嘉之会也。利者，义之和也。贞者，事之干也。君子体人足从长人，嘉会足以合礼，利物足以和义，贞固足以干事。君子行此四德者，故曰乾元亨利贞。”，又说：“乾元者，始而亨者也。利贞者，性情也。干始能以美利利天下。”孔颖达疏：“元，始也；亨，通也；利，和也；贞，正也。言此卦之德，有纯阳之性，自然能以阳气始生万物，而得元始、亨通，能使物性和谐，各有其利，又能使物坚固贞正得终。”（《周易正义》卷二）\n近人高亨、李镜池等训元为大，亨为享即享祭，利为利益或有利，贞为占问或卜问。合起来说即：“古人举行祭祀时，若卜得此卦，乃是有利之贞问，可举行大享之祭。（《周易大传今注》卷一）北宋周敦颐以元亨利贞配四时，发挥了《周易·干·象》所谓“天行健”的解释，叫元，始也，子时配春。言万物始生，得其元始之序。发育长养。亨，通也，于时配夏。夏以通畅含其嘉美之道。利，义也，于时配秋。秋以成实得其利物之宜；贞，正也，于时配冬。冬以物之终，纳干正之道”。（《周子全书》）另外，亦有人将元亨利贞配四方（汉扬雄）、配“一二三四”的序数（今人尚秉和）等等。宋李觏（gòu）则认为元、亨、利、贞，分别涉及气、形、命、性。“元以始物，亨以通物，利以宜物，贞以干物，始者其气也，通者其形也，宜者其命也，干者其性也。（《删定易图序论》之五）\n\n## 语句解释\n\n### 基本字义\n\n中国《周易·乾卦》的卦辞。许慎《说文》，训贞为“卜问”。甲骨文“贞”字，亦为卜问之义。近人认为，“元亨”即“大亨”，古人举行大亨的祭礼，筮得此卦,后来记载于卦辞中,用来表示吉利。在《易经》中，“元亨，利贞”是占筮之辞，原无哲学涵义。“元亨利贞”，往往被解释为：“元，始也；亨，通也；利，和也；贞，正也。言此卦之德，有纯阳之性，自然能以阳气始生万物，而得元始、亨通，能使物性和谐，各有其利，又能使物坚固贞正得终。”\n《左传》襄公九年载：穆姜释随卦卦辞，读“元、亨、利、贞”，以元为仁，亨为礼，利为义，贞为正，称为“四德”，赋予道德规范的涵义。唐孔颖达《周易正义》引《子夏传》说：“元，始也；亨，通也；利，和也；贞，正也。”认为乾卦“四德”意味着阳气始生万物，物生而通顺，能使万物和谐，并且坚固而得其终。\n宋程颐在所著《易传》中,依据孔说,将此四字解释为“元者万物之始，亨者万物之长，利者万物之遂，贞者万物之成。”以元亨利贞为天道生长万物的四种德行。朱熹将此四德解为元亨利贞之“理”，表现为万物从生长到成熟四个阶段，“物生为元，长为亨,成而未全为利,成熟为贞”。四阶段周而复始，被称为“贞下起元”，遂成为哲学家用来表述事物从始到终发展阶段的术语。\n\n### 详细释义\n\n乾元亨利贞四个字本是分开解释的，干，原是人们用来表示观测日影的工具，这里用作卦名。 元亨利贞分别讲作“大”“通”“顺利”“正”，被许多人连作一词，是指人的运气很好，交了好运。这四个词其实包含重要的思想内涵，据李鼎祚《周易集解》云：“言干禀纯阳之性，故能首出庶物......是以君子法干而行四德。”这里的四德就是指“元亨利贞”。\n六十四卦第一卦：乾卦：元亨利贞 象曰：天行健，君子以自强不息。\n元亨利贞之“元”【“干”是创造万事万物的开始和动力，“元”统领着天道自然，是万事万物的本源，是第一位的。】\n元亨利贞之“亨”【要使自己的目标（元）通达、顺利（亨），需要“云行雨施”“足以合礼”“嘉之会也”，就是要按一定的礼节，在公司就是要按照企业的管理制度和规则的情况下，阴阳和合，上下交流、主顾沟通，天地云雨，整合资源，这样就能达成目标，万物化成】\n元亨利贞之“利”【最大的“利”是“各正性命”“保合太和”（精神和物质都得到按需分配的满足，在不同时间不同地点都能合乎道义，持盈保泰，维持一种高度的和谐状态，即人与自身、他人、社会、自然的和谐），“利者，义之和也”【在利益面前要考虑到义，符合义的就取，不义之财就坚决不受】\n元亨利贞之“贞”【贞：正固、坚定、诚信。做一时的“元亨利”是容易的，要长久的“元亨利”就有难度。“天行健，君子以自强不息”，只有持之以恒，坚定信念，保持诚信才能善始善终，才能过“足以干事”】{员工和管理员都要有诚信和持之以恒}\n\n### 易经四德\n\n元、亨、利、贞为《易经》中的四德，取自于自然界植物的生长过程。\n元：象征一个事物的初始，对应春天，植物的发芽。\n亨：象征一个事物的成长，对应夏天，植物的生长。\n利：象征一个事物的收获，对应秋天，植物的开花结果。\n贞：象征一个事物的收藏，对应冬天，植物的落叶过冬。\n\n### 词语新解\n\n干的卦辞曰：“干。元亨利贞。”\n此四字的解释，旧注颇多歧见，以《子夏传》的“四德”说较为通行：“元，始也；亨，通也；利，和也；贞，正也。”宋程颐 《程氏易传》卷一：“元亨利贞，谓之四德。元者，万物之始；亨者，万物之长；利者，万物之遂；贞者，万物之成。”这里说的是自然万物生成的全过程。此过程同时也是贞下起元、周而复始的运动，故又可以解为春、夏、秋、冬。“元”相当于春时万物之发生，“亨”相当于夏时万物之长养，“利”相当于秋时万物之成熟，“贞”相当于冬时万物之收藏。支配这一运动过程的机制，是阴与阳的和谐统一。\n《系辞上》曰：“干知大始，坤作成物。”所谓“元亨利贞”，无非是对干与坤创生万物功能的赞语。乾坤合一，天地交通，这就是元亨；阴阳相应，协调配合，成和而物生，这就是利。利，是元亨的基本出发点，其尺度是人的需要，天地生物以利人，即乾坤两卦的“利”之所在。贞，指事物获得了正定。\n《易传·文言》云：“元者，善之长也；亨者，嘉之会也；利者，义之和也；贞者，事之干也。君子体仁足以长人，嘉会足以合礼，利物足以和义，贞固足以干事。”西方人说《周易》是代数学。“元亨利贞”可以看成公式，它可以代进春夏秋冬，也可以代进仁礼义正。《文言》的解释是拿人伦道德相附会，较之原义多少走样，但它开启了两汉以后以儒理释易的先声，元亨利贞也就被赋予了道德规范的涵义。我们可以说，“四德说”虽非《易》之本理，然多年以来已经深入人心，也曾有效促进《易》之义理的推广。\n《文言》是对《干》、《坤》二卦所作的阐释，通篇贯穿以德释卦的思想。《彖》曰：“大哉乾元，万物资始，乃统天。”由此可见，“元”是万物的开始，因而构成了“云行雨施”的仁义；仁是人的各种德行的核心，也是统率人的各种德行的总则，所以才会说：“元者，善之长也”。“亨”，通也；“嘉”，美也。孔颖达对“亨者，嘉之会也”的解释是：“言天能通畅万物，使物嘉美之会聚，故云嘉之会也”。世界万物只有发生交感作用，才能亨通。人与人之间也只有进行沟通交流，才能达到美好的会合而行动一致。“利”，义之和就是利。“义者，宜也 ”（《中庸》）；“义者，正也” （《墨子·天志下》）；“义，人之正路也”（《孟子·离娄上》）。所谓“义”，就是人的行为要合于仁的原则，要合于礼的规定，要合于道德的和法律的规定。换言之，凡是合于仁的原则、合于礼的规定的利，才是真正有“利”。可见原儒在讲到义利问题时，“义”字本身就包含了正当适宜的利益因素，合情合理的利就是义，公利公益更是大义。“贞”，正也。“干”，树之正身，主干。纯正而执，是做事离不开的主干。“贞”正是一种美德，只有“贞”正才能树立威信，才能得到民众的拥护和支持，才能无往而不胜。\n“君子体仁足以长人，嘉会足以合礼，利物足以和义，贞固足以干事”，描述了君子的四个特征，完全可以用来要求领导者。“体仁”，实践、履行仁爱之德。“长”，领导、管理、指挥、统治的意思，也可以理解为让他人成长。也就是说，一个企业家或一位管理者，只要实践仁爱之德，就有足够的条件去进行领导或管理。\n“嘉会足以合礼”，良好的因素集合起来，才可以合乎礼仪，形成良好秩序，这就要做到上下沟通、左右沟通、内外沟通，把各种不同的意见、不同的信息协调起来，找出它们之间的中介点，求得共识，达成行动。荀子说：“和则一，一则多力，多力则强”（《荀子·王制》）。对于领导者来说，《周易》所强调的“交感亨通”的价值和意义，是怎么说也不过分的。\n“利物足以合义。”朱熹《周易本义》说：“利者，生物之遂。物各得宜，不相妨害，故于时为秋，于人则为义，而得其分之和。”也就是说，长远的真实利益，来源于人们对于合宜性的考虑。\n“贞固足以干事。”朱熹《周易本义》说：“贞固者，知正之所在，而固守之。”君子有坚持正道之德，便足以办好事情。《周易》把“贞正”看得很高：“知进退存亡而不失其正者，其唯圣人乎？”知正守正，其品德的高尚性，和圣人差不多了。\n以上所阐述的仁礼义正，叫“四德”。君子行此四德，就能干大事，成大业。后来儒家进一步发挥，把正变成了智，再加上一个信，就成了我们耳熟能详的“五德”——仁义礼智信。\n\n### 更优解释\n\n依《文言》之解，卦辞当作”元，亨，利，贞“，但原文却是”元亨，利贞“，可见《文言》之解尚存可疑之处，不可全信。依原文句读，”元“作”大“，”亨“作”顺利通达“，“利”作“吉利”，“贞”作“占卜”，即原文意为大吉，吉占，如此则符合《周易》的本意，甚为妥当。"], "selected_questions": ["孔颖达疏中对于元亨利贞的解释是怎样的？",

{"name": "苍龙号航空母舰", "documents": ["## 苍龙号航空母舰\n苍龙号航空母舰（苍龙 / そうりゅう ）是日本帝国海军第一艘以全通式航空母舰功能需求为设计导向建造的航空母舰，与飞龙一样，都属于日军第二批次建造完工的航空母舰。有别于赤城与加贺等1920年代完工之改装航舰，1930年代服役的苍龙号为日军第一艘以航空母舰需求为考量出发点设计的专业正规航舰。\n## 概要\n1920年代的华盛顿海军条约限制了日本航舰总吨位为8万1千吨标准排水量。当时四艘已经服役的航舰（赤城、加贺、凤翔、龙骧）算入后日本只剩下12,630吨可以使用，但日本海军考量凤翔号将可以在服役16年后（1938年）报废，最后让苍龙级以消耗吨位和凤翔号替代舰的方针成案，2艘军舰将有2万1千吨的额度可以使用。\n1932年，苍龙号初稿「G6」案递交给日本海军，此时的苍龙号预期设计一艘标准排水量12000吨、3座双连装8吋主砲、6座双连装5吋高射砲、搭载飞机70架的「航空战舰」。设计如此高标准的武备酬载是为了要同时具备制空及制海的能量，到1934年「G8」案时再度改变设计；标准排水量下修为10500吨以符合两艘分配额度，武装变为1座三连装8吋砲、1座双连装8吋砲、10座双连装5吋高吋砲、搭载飞机100架的航空母舰。当然如此天方夜谭的技术标准舰政本部根本无法做到，在双方妥协下变成1座三连装155公厘炮、1座双连装155公厘炮、6座双连装5吋高射砲、搭载飞机70架。「G8」舰型预定在昭和九年度（1936年）第二次军舰补充计划中建造。\n然而，1934年爆发了友鹤事件，日本海军开始检讨手边造舰计划与现役舰盲目塞上重武装造成的船只稳定性问题，新型航舰因此取消了155砲设计，同时下修技术标准；最终定稿的建造方案为「G9」。在1935年，「G9」舰下水之后，帝国海军确定第四舰队事件主因，因此使用焊接技术的舰体区域强度再度遭到检讨改良。因为接连发生的意外、1930年代后期新型舰载机服役所需的相关整合设备建置，苍龙号在建造前后不断的修改设计，更造成下水后仪装工程时程大幅拖延，虽然延长了建造时间，但让军舰性能最后走向合理化；而有了赤城与加贺的改装经验后，日本海军在苍龙号的舰型设计上也就更加成熟。同时，1934年日本宣告将退出华盛顿海军条约，并在1936年生效，于是日本在苍龙号的实际建造上根本没管10,500吨标准排水量的门槛问题。经过修正的改良版飞龙号满载更上达2万吨，但是因为当时伦敦海军条约尚具约束力，所以日本也不敢明目张胆的讲自己无视条约造舰，对外公布的苍龙号资料仍讲此军舰为排水量1万吨、全长209.84公尺、最大宽度20.84公尺的假数据；由于这个「官方数字」形象太强，导致在中途岛战役时美军SBD俯冲轰炸机机组员只晓得自己炸中了大型航舰，回母舰写战斗纪要时也大多推测自己炸中了赤城号与加贺号，没有驾驶员认为自己有炸中1万吨级的航空母舰，因此美军飞官在第一时间并没有报告到自己炸中苍龙号这个实情。\n##设计特征\n从1932年的原始想定到1937年完工，苍龙号的设计定位有过多次改变，最后成为标准的正规航舰构型。但有些技术需求仍保留下来，成为当时列强航空母舰中具有独特风格的性能。\n1930年代初期航空兵力尚未成熟，当时舰载机单靠水平轰炸想摧毁具厚重装甲的大型舰还相当困难，因此当时的海军专家们仍认为舰队最终还是要依靠舰砲的打击力决胜负；早期的苍龙号基于「航空巡洋舰」这项定位，需要与巡洋舰部队共同行动争夺海上制空权，且以击毁敌方航空母舰为主要设计方向。\n苍龙号的设计仍假想可能要与美军巡洋舰进行舰砲作战，为此基本速度不能低过布鲁克林级轻巡洋舰或波特兰级重巡洋舰，初期设计极速便以34节为目标，且具备防御巡洋舰的8吋主砲的防御力。\n虽然日后转为正规航舰设计，但为追求高航速所设计出长宽比10：1之修长舰体成为苍、飞龙两舰的外表特色，主机也因此使用与最上级重巡洋舰相同款式带空气预热器之高温高压重油水管锅炉提供高水准输出；防护力则在后续评估中被放弃，外壳水线装甲带只使用41公厘厚之NVNC钢、在弹药库与轮机舱等增设90公厘厚之水平装甲、航空汽油库垂直装甲防御则达到150公厘，理论上防御标准可抵御8吋砲等级；但是在水平防御设计上则相当贫乏，飞行甲板本身无防御力，有敷设防御区块的地点只有轮机舱（25公厘）、弹药库与油槽（55公厘），这种厚度对对当时技术尚未成熟的俯冲轰炸等防御规划显见未列入考量，对空中轰炸没有规划的弱点则在中途岛海战中成为致命伤；同时，苍龙号的机库损管设计只依靠设置在升降机旁，可在急难时将机库分成三块的防火百叶窗与二氧化碳灭火装置，除此之外并没有其它设计可处置封闭式机库除发生闷炸时的对应手段，当然更别说是逃生规划；这类设计瑕疵也是日后苍龙号死伤惨重的远因，但当时的军舰设计团队与海军认为只要多载一些战斗机排除敌机，夺得制空权便可以解决这些问题。\n## 战史\n### 太平洋战争前\n苍龙号于1934年11月20日在吴海军工厂动工，1935年12月23日下水，并在同厂实施仪装，但是官方文献上却误植下水日期为1月23日；1937年11月11日实施公试时以18,871吨排水量、输出动力15万2483匹轴马力达成34.898节的海试极速。通过验收后1937年12月29日服役，当时苍龙号的舰载机部队为九五式舰上战斗机18架、九六式舰上攻击机12架、九六式舰上轰炸机27架；虽然日本海军当时有更新式的九六式舰上战斗机，但因前线急需战机所以没新机好用，只能先拿旧机顶替。1938年4月25日，9架九五舰战、18架九六舰爆、9架九六舰攻转场至南京支援侵华行动，随后沿长江前进布署到安徽芜湖，1938年6月转移至安庆，为当时日军即将发动的武汉会战提供前线掩护任务，很可能与苏联航空志愿队交手，但没有确定战果。\n经过短暂的前线布署，1938年7月10日苍龙号所属舰载机归建，苍龙号则开往华南沿海巡逻，为广州战役的登陆日军提供掩护；由于中华民国空军将空战兵力投注在战争白热化的武汉一带，华南极度缺乏空中武力，苍龙号的舰载机部队没有任何的空战纪录，只持续为日军提供陆上火力支援，1938年12月苍龙号返日，在同年的12月15日正式编入帝国海军第二航空战队；随后的1年半苍龙号仅在日本本土海域实施整训。\n1940年9月到10月，苍龙号实施她第二次海外布署，她以海南岛为母港为日军入侵法属印度支那提供空中支援；事件告一段落后在1941年2月移防台湾，强化封锁华南一带的偷运行动。1941年3月，苍龙号为调解越南与泰国的国境纷争开往南海时与23驱逐队的夕月号驱逐舰发生追撞；苍龙号的舰艏撞到夕月号的左舷中央，双方虽有船体破裂，但没造成沉船事故。苍龙号将舰载机队转移给飞龙号航空母舰后开回佐世保实施维修，在1941年4月返回横须贺。\n1941年4月10日，第一航空舰队成军。在1941年7月苍龙号再度返回海南岛，为日军占领越南南部提供支援。1941年8月7日返回日本，9月22日到10月24日入坞进行整检改装，回归战列后成为第二航空战队旗舰。\n### 偷袭珍珠港\n1941年11月，日本帝国海军决定对美国太平洋舰队重镇珍珠港进行突击，主攻由第一航空舰队的6艘正规空母执行；苍龙号在11月时的舰载机编制为27架零战、18架九七舰攻、18架九九舰爆。由于苍龙号与加贺号一样有续航力较短的问题，第二航空战队司令山口多闻决定在船内增设汽油桶这样的不安全酬载方式增加军舰续航力。\n1941年12月8日，第一航空舰队偷袭珍珠港。苍龙号在此役的2波攻击机队分别为：\n九七舰攻18架（水平轰炸任务10架，指挥官：分队长阿部平次郎上尉、鱼雷攻击任务8架＝指挥官：分队长长井彊上尉）、零战8架＝指挥官：分队长菅波政治上尉\n九九舰爆18架＝指挥官：飞行队长江草隆繁少校、零战9架＝指挥官：分队长饭田房太上尉\n苍龙号舰载机队第一波攻击被分配的目标为福特岛西北岸的航母码头，但是因为航空母舰都出港了所以只好攻击福特岛北岸码头。此区停泊的船舰为实验用的老旧战列舰犹他号战舰、同样为旧型的罗里号轻巡洋舰，以及较新的赫勒拿号轻巡洋舰及奥格拉拉号布雷舰，苍龙号的舰攻飞行员「误认」犹他号为美军战舰对其发动攻击，这4艘军舰均遭重创。但有几架舰攻机违背任务指示转往攻击加利福尼亚号战舰。\n在当日偷袭中，苍龙号的舰载机在第二波攻击时损失3架零战、2架九九舰爆。零战在第二波攻击时除了护航外，也攻击了Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay，其中1架在攻击机场时被高射炮给击落，2架就日方飞行员说法是遭美军战机击落，但不确定由谁达成；日军并认为自己在该次扫荡任务击落2架美军战机。2架损失的九九舰爆则是在攻击珍珠港内军舰时遭到防空火器给击落，该波攻击机队并未造成珍珠港内美军军舰明确的损失。\n虽然损失不大，但是因为没达到任务目标，苍龙号的轰炸部队指挥官江草隆繁曾向柳本舰长及山口指挥官建言要让二航战搜索附近海域确实击沉美军航舰；但是在舰队指挥官南云忠一及舰队参谋长草鹿龙之介的「保存舰队」方针下否决。随后苍龙号受命支援威克岛。\n### 威克岛攻略\n在偷袭珍珠港的同时，第四舰队旗下之第六水雷战队也在掩护日本军方进行威克岛攻占任务，却被驻岛的美国海军陆战队打得灰头土脸，在航舰尚未参战前损失了如月号、疾风号2艘驱逐舰。南云舰队接获消息派遣第二航空战队（苍龙、飞龙）驰援威克岛；1941年12月21日，苍龙号上的9架零战、14架九九舰爆轰炸威克岛；12月22日，3架零战、16架九七舰攻空袭威克，但是遭美军海陆211攻击机中队（VMA-211）的F4F战斗机偷袭得手，2架九七舰攻遭击坠，1架迫降损失，但护航的零战也成功将这批野猫给击落。12月23日，为掩护日本海军陆战队抢滩，苍龙号发动两波攻势，一波是6架零战、6架舰爆，另一波是2架零战、9架舰攻，当天威克岛遭日军占领。完成任务的苍龙号于12月23日脱离南洋舰队编制，12月29日返回日本吴港。\n### 空袭澳洲与横扫印度洋\n1942年1月18日，苍龙号开抵帛琉，飞行队则转移到贝里琉岛待命。停留在当地海域时曾接获发现7艘美军潜舰的讯息，后证明只是海豚而虚惊一场；1月21日，第二航空战队开抵摩鹿加群岛的安汶岛支援当地部队，苍龙号派出了9架战机、9架舰攻、9架舰爆轰炸安汶，1月24日再度以同等规模轰炸同地点，两次攻击均无损失。1月28日，二航战与第一航空战队在帛琉合流；2月15日，4艘航舰编入南方部队准备攻击澳洲北部。2月19日，苍龙号在空袭达尔文时几乎可说倾巢而出，派出了9架零战、18架舰攻、18架舰爆，当天苍龙号机组宣称击落9架P-40战斗机，只有1架九七舰攻因迫降失败损失，并与其它航空部队共同击沉8艘盟军舰艇、击伤2艘驱逐舰与1艘水上飞机母舰。苍龙号的纪录确定战果是她所辖的9架九九舰爆对一艘盟军改装巡洋舰集中攻击，且命中3发250公斤炸弹将其击沉。\n3月1日，一架负责侦查的九七舰攻在圣诞岛南方发现1艘美军油轮(USS Pecos，AO-6)。上午12点55分，加贺号组成9架舰爆攻击队（指挥官渡部俊夫上尉）起飞前至猎杀；苍龙号的舰爆攻击队则在13点9分起飞（指挥官池田正伟上尉）。13点21分，加贺号部队捕捉目标发动攻击，9架飞机携带的9枚炸弹中只有1发命中，剩下8发都只是至近弹，其中4架遭防空机枪击伤，加贺号的机队在14点39分归舰；而苍龙号机队在13点30分，也就是加贺号机队攻击时飞抵目标，在第一批未成后加入补刀，虽然有5架舰爆遭击伤，但成功命中3枚炸弹与1发至近弹，最后Pecos号在左倾15度的姿势下于15点48分沉没；苍龙号的机队则在15点01分归舰，因此没有亲眼见证沉没战果。同天晚上7点，苍龙号再度派出9架舰爆处理巽他海峡海战战败后逃窜的美军驱逐舰埃德萨尔号（DD-219），她遭比叡号、利根号、筑摩号等大型舰炮击后已经失去动力，因此轻易的就被250公斤炸弹给击沉。\n4月5日，与第一及第五航空战队集合，空袭了英国海军太平洋舰队的可伦坡与亭可马里基地，击沉了竞技神号航空母舰、重巡洋舰多塞特郡号、重巡洋舰康沃尔号等舰艇。\n### 中途岛战役\n1942年6月，第一第二航空战队参加了中途岛海战，6月5日遭到美国海军航空队的俯冲轰炸机攻击，命中3发炸弹之后起火燃烧，随后爆炸沉没。该舰是四艘航空母舰中最初被击沉的一只。", "同义词\n苍龙号(Soryu)航空母舰（苍龙号(Soryu)航空母舰）一般指苍龙号航空母舰\n\n苍龙号航空母舰是旧日本海军第一艘设计建造的中型航空母舰，与飞龙号一样，都属于第二批建造完工的航空母舰，有别于赤城号与加贺号为战列巡洋舰和战列舰改装。\n苍龙与飞龙最早的设计是“航空战舰”，是为了在华盛顿海军条约之下既拥有大型舰炮同时仍然拥有一定的海上制空权，后来却发现同时要载很多的飞机与大炮是行不通的，而转设计为专职的航空母舰，而有了赤城与加贺的改装经验后，以更成熟的技术将苍龙与飞龙建造成比起前者拥有更高性能的航空母舰。\n\n1942年6月中途岛海战时苍龙被美军击沉。\n\n## 发展沿革\n\n### 建造缘由\n\n苍龙号是日本海军的主力航母之一，按照日本海军的分类，苍龙号和飞龙号同属于苍龙级，但是由于飞龙号的改动很大，已经基本上可以视作另外一个级别。\n日本海军在完成号称世界最早的航空母舰“凤翔号”之后，又陆续的计划建造了由战舰、巡洋战舰改造而来的航母加贺号与赤城号，并有小型航空母舰龙骧号的建造计划，因此，在华盛顿海军军缩条约的限制下，当时的日本海军航母保有允许量就只剩下 21,000 吨。\n在伦敦海军条约中，规定了巡洋舰种的保有量中，容许拥有不超过 25% 吨位的具有航空甲板的巡洋舰，于是美国海军遂提出了将重巡洋舰和航空母舰混合的航空巡洋舰计划，而日本海军与之相对应的，也在昭和七年（1932）提出了所谓的 G6 计划，本计划中的航空巡洋舰造型奇特，在如同航母般的外型上，于飞行甲板前端下面布置了三座渐高的双联装203毫米炮塔，预计性能如下：速度 36 节，排水量 17,500 吨，舰载机 70 架。\n在昭和九年（1934）开始的第二次舰船补充计划（丸二计划）中，军令部要求以 G6 计划为参考，将剩下的 21,000 吨航母保有量使用来建造两艘所谓的航空巡洋舰。该计划中的航空巡洋舰性能如下：排水量 10,050 吨，203 毫米的主炮装备在中心线上，127 毫米高射炮 20 门（10 座双联装炮塔），防空机枪 40 挺以上，搭载机 100 架（半数置于飞行甲板），速度 36 节，预计于昭和十一年（1936）完成一号舰，而于次年完成二号舰。\n在 G8 方案里，要求苍龙号以 10,000 吨的基准排水量上安装了双联装和三连装的 203 毫米主炮炮塔各一座，还有 127 毫米的双联装高平两用炮 10 座共计 20 门。\n从上面的图中只可以看出，G8 方案更象是一般的航空母舰，但是要在 10,000 吨的基准排水量内实现上述要素，在当时的技术水平下根本不可能实现。而且在其即将开工之前，发生了日本帝国海军史上有名的“友鹤事件”。这个事件导致了对苍龙级的设计方案再一次修改，其借鉴了“赤城”号和“加贺”号的建造和使用经验，因此更加的完善，最终成为了纯正的航空母舰。\n最后苍龙成为一种现代化的航空母舰。\n\n### 建造列表\n\n本级舰一艘，即苍龙号。\n\n### 时间表\n\n“苍龙”号由吴港海军船厂建造，1934年11月20日开工，1935年12月23日下水，1937年12月29日完工。\n1942年6月，在中途岛海战中，苍龙号航空母舰遭到美国海军约克城号航空母舰的俯冲轰炸机攻击，被命中3枚炸弹之后起火，随后沉没。\n\n## 技术特点\n\n苍龙号航空母舰是日本海军第一艘专门建造的大型航空母舰，是第二次船舰补充计划（丸二计划）中建造的舰艇之一。日本海军通过赤城号与加贺号的改装经验，将更成熟的技术运用于苍龙号的建造。\n受限制海军军备条约对日本海军拥有航空母舰总吨位的限制，苍龙号的排水量较小，排水量虽只有赤城号与加贺号的一半左右，但是却拥有更快的速度。采用全通式飞行甲板，双层机库，岛式舰桥位于右舷，其后右舷是与赤城号航空母舰类似的向下弯曲的横卧式烟囱。缺点是防护装甲较弱。\n苍龙级号称“日本海军最初的现代化航母”，外观特征为位于右舷前部的小型舰桥和有限中部向下弯曲的烟囱。为实现高航速而采用的重巡洋舰船体，并安装了总功率 15 万马力的蒸汽轮机，最大航速达 34.9 节，创下了日本海军航母史上的记录。由于借鉴赤城和加贺大改装的经验，苍龙级在排水量约为前者一半（标准排水量 15,900 吨）的情况下仍能达到与前者相近的性能。具备双层机库和全通式飞行甲板，前、中、后 3 部升降机，常规载机 57 架，对空火力为 6 座双联装 127 毫米高炮，首次采用的装置还包括舰尾着舰标识、阻拦索等，这些都成为了日本帝国海军其他正规航母的标准装备，只是由于吨位限制，防护能力较弱。\n苍龙号于昭和十二年（1937）12 月 29 日完工，次年（1938）四月，苍龙号被派往中国战场支援，将舰载机的一部份派遣到南京。同年十月参加了广东方面作战的支持任务，并于十二月归回本土。飞龙号服役后两舰合并为第 2 航空战队，在司令官山口多闻少将力荐下参加珍珠港作战，昭和十六年（1941）七月，与飞龙号航空母舰一起南下支援法属南印度支那的进攻，之后就为了筹备攻击珍珠港，而回到本土，展开严苛的训练。在同年十一月二十六日，从单冠湾出击前往珍珠港的苍龙号搭载了零战 21 机，七式舰攻 18 机，九九式舰爆 18 机，合计 57 机，战果丰硕，苍龙号舰爆队投弹炸毁了亚利桑那号战列舰。由于续航能力强，在执行完珍珠港的任务回国途中，苍龙号所属的第二航空战队还奉命前往威克岛支援，直到该岛在 12 月底被攻克。\n\n原本与苍龙号相同的飞龙号，在修正后有着许多的不同。飞龙号是日本帝国海军的一艘航空母舰，与苍龙一样属于第二次船舰补充计划（丸二计划）中建造的舰艇之一，原本是设计成跟苍龙号相同的第二号同型舰，不过在有了加贺号的改装经验与苍龙号的施工经验之后，对飞龙号有更多加强修正的设计。尤于完工后与原先最早设计变化很多，最后飞龙与苍龙的舰型已相差甚远，于是便独立成为飞龙级航空母舰与苍龙不同的是，在发生友鹤事件之后，日本海军便不再以较为先进且快速的电焊法施工，而是采用较传统而缓慢的铆接法。飞行甲板虽与苍龙同长，而宽度却更多了一米，但船体本身并无加宽。在加贺号的改装经验中，海军航空部发现舰桥位置于舷侧中央的位置较利于飞机发舰的准备与指挥，所以其后包含飞龙的航舰设计，皆把舰桥位置移至中央，但实际完工后发现，虽然舰身中段突出的烟囱与置中的舰桥分居左右舷两侧可以稳定船身的重心，但是排烟系统与热气会造成飞行甲板上方严重的乱流，所以后来的航舰设计右改回右舷前侧的舰桥位置设计了，而飞龙在下令更改设计时已接近完工皆段，所以仍然是舰桥置中的设计。除了因为排水量比苍龙更大而减慢速度之外，有别于苍龙的双舵设计，飞龙则改为单舵。\n\n##

服役事件\n\n苍龙号于1937年12月服役，次年即投入中国近海，其舰载机在长江流域和华南地区协助日本陆军部队进行侵华战争。\n\n在飞龙号航空母舰1939年7月服役后其与与苍龙号共同编成联合舰队第二航空战队。\n\n并于1940年加入日军进驻法属中南半岛的支援部队工作，结束任务之后与苍龙一同回到日本本土，进行战前训练。1941年初，日本制定的袭击美国海军基地珍珠港的计划。攻击珍珠港后返航途中第二航空战队又受命支援攻占威克岛。1941年12月8日，飞龙号与其它五艘中大型航空母舰一起前往夏威夷，第二航空战队在山口多闻的指挥下，编入日本航空舰队参与偷袭珍珠港，太平洋战争爆发。胜利后于返航途中，第二航空战队受命前往威克岛海域支援登陆作战。\n\n1942 年1月，苍龙号与飞龙号一起南下参加荷属东印度群岛的攻略作战，2月，在帛琉与第一航空战队会合，轰炸了澳洲的达尔文港。1942 年 4 月，第一、二、五航空战队奉命进入印度洋，扫荡英国远东舰队残部。\n\n由于对方采取了避战机动策略，双方并与直接交手。4 月 5 日日机袭击科伦坡，苍龙号飞行队长江草隆繁指挥的 53 架 99 舰爆遭遇英军重巡洋舰多塞特郡号和康沃尔号，前者在 13 分钟内被炸沉，后者在 18 分钟内沉没，炸弹命中率高达 88%。9 日日机又突袭亭可马里，将基地内大批飞机、船舶和设施炸毁，随后又与友舰配合、向正在驶往锡兰岛东岸的英军轻型航母竞技神号发动进攻并将其击沉，炸弹命中率达 82%。\n\n昭和十七年（1942年）5月27日，苍龙号随着一队前所未有的大舰队从本土出发前往中途岛，参加了惊天动地的中途岛大海战。苍龙号当时仍在第二航空战队里，僚舰仍是飞龙号，他们都归在第二航空战队司令山口多闻海军少将的指挥下。此海战中苍龙号除了预定的载机（当时舰载机搭载编制为21架零式舰上战斗机、21架九九式舰上轰炸机、21架九七式舰上攻击机）以外，还搭载了两架后来彗星舰爆前身的新锐高速侦察机二式舰侦，和准备配上占领后的中途岛基地的三架零战。\n\n由于密码遭美国破译，所以美国集中了全部的力量朝着苍龙号所在的南云机动部队发动猛烈的攻势。当日上午 10 时 25 分，就当舰队数度击退来袭鱼雷机，准备好迎风放出战机时，美军俯冲轰炸机突然从空中窜下，在短短几分钟间，三枚直击弹命中苍龙号飞行甲板上面，并平均的落在三座升架机前，爆炸连续引爆了停在甲板上正等待起飞的战机和堆积在甲板上的炸弹鱼雷，全舰陷入一片大火，10 时 40 分，苍龙号的主机就停止了动作。\n火灾延伸到鱼雷库，发生了大爆炸，10 时 45 分，柳本柳作舰长下令全舰弃船，而自己却坚持留在舰桥。当天整个下午苍龙号都持续着猛烈的燃烧，日落时， 火势稍有减退，阿部士官长奉命将柳本舰长带下来，但是当他看到手持军刀，独自肃立在舰桥，表情坚定决定与舰共存亡的柳本后，也只能哭着离开。7 时 13 分， 焚烧了八小时半的苍龙号沉没，1103 名船员中有 718 名战死。"], "selected_questions":

历史沿革\n\n### 起步时期\n\n（50年代）\n20世纪50年代即建国初，那时排球强国是苏联和其他东欧国家，而当年的国际比赛主要是6人排球，9人排球为主流的中国，便需要重新学习6人排球的规则、战略和比赛方法。中华全国体育会便积极安排男女排球运动员到东欧等地参加排球比赛，借以吸收经验，经过一系列的友谊赛，中国男女排球运动员开始掌握6人排球的比赛方法\n。\n1953年，中国排球协会正式成立，张之槐先生出任主席，更在1954年成为国际排球联合会（FIVB）的正式会员。其后，中国排球协会（以下简称中国排协）获发邀请参加1956年在法国举行的世界排球锦标赛（男子第三届、女子第二届）。\n1956年女队在参加在法国举行的第二届世界女子排球锦标赛，比赛中，中国女排先后击败奥地利、荷兰和联邦德国等女排队伍，获得第6名。\n\n### 初露时期\n\n（60至70年代）\n60年代，一股亚洲女排新势力正挑战着苏联女排的皇者地位，这股势力就是有“东洋魔女”之称的日本国家女子排球队，“东洋魔女”由大松博文的教导下，在1960年的第三届世界女子排球锦标赛中，仅败于卫冕的苏联女排夺得亚军，却接连在的两年后的第四届世界女排锦标赛和四年后的1964年东京奥运会的决赛中击败该宿敌夺标，日本女排更在1960年后曾创下118场国际赛连胜纪录，震惊世界。“东洋魔女”的成功亦引起中国排球界的注意，于是中国排协经过周恩来总理的批准，在1965年4月邀请了大松博文来华一个月，协助训练中国女排，令中国女排得到较有系统的训练和明确的发展方针。1974年，中国女排在第七届世界女子排球锦标赛中，获第14名。及至1976年，新的中国女排国家队正式成立，袁伟民成为了中国女排的主教练\n。\n中国女排终于在1979年的亚洲女排锦标赛中有所突破，在决赛以盘数3-1击败当时的亚洲和前世界冠军日本女排，首次称霸亚洲。\n\n### 腾飞时期\n\n（80年代）\n中国女排在袁伟民的指导下，在80年代开始腾飞。1981年，第三届世界杯在日本举行，比赛采用单循环制，经过了7轮28场比赛，中国女排以7战全胜姿态，压倒卫冕的主办国日本，获得冠军，成为中国三大球﹙足球、篮球、排球﹚中的首个世界冠军。\n1982年，中国女排参加在秘鲁举行的第九届世界女子排球锦标赛，初赛对美国队曾以盘数0-3落败，主教练袁伟民果断起用年轻队员梁艳、郑美珠，结果中国女排以3-0轻取古巴，赢得了扭转战局的关键一役。中国女排在决赛以直落三局轻取主办国秘鲁，首次获得世界女排锦标赛冠军\n。\n尽管在1983年的亚洲锦标赛决赛败于日本，进入调整期的中国女排仍是洛杉矶奥运会的夺标热门。1984年，中国女排参加在洛杉矶举行的1984年洛杉矶奥运会，虽然中国女排又在分组赛被宿敌美国队击败，其后却越战越勇，最终，中国女排在决赛以直落三局轻取主办国美国，报却分组赛一败之仇，并首次获得奥运金牌，同时亦成为女子排球三连冠。\n1985、1986两年之间，中国女排又获得了1985年第四届世界杯冠军和1986年第十届世界女排锦标赛冠军，成就世界女排史上首个五连冠的佳绩。\n1980年代初的中国，正是百废待兴，女排以拼搏精神赢得三连冠和五连冠的成绩，中国女排成为了当时中国人的模范和骄傲，更是中国在80年代腾飞的象征\n。\n\n### 下滑时期\n\n（90年代）\n中国女排自1986年在捷克斯洛伐克夺得第十届世界女排锦标赛冠军后，开始青黄不接，早一辈的名将如郎平和梁艳等早已相继退役，1988年的汉城奥运会半决赛中败于该届冠军苏联女排，最后只获得铜牌。中国女排在1989年的第五届世界杯相继负于前苏联女排和实力强大的古巴女排，最终获得第三名。\n1990年的第十一届世界女排锦标赛均卫冕失败，决赛负于苏联而获得亚军。\n\n在1992年巴塞罗那奥运会上，巫丹的禁药事件让胡进所带领的中国女排只获得第7名\n。\n1995年，前女排球员——郎平被中国排协聘为中国女排主教练，她率领中国女排走出历史低谷，获得1996年亚特兰大奥运会银牌和第十三届世界女排锦标赛亚军，但她始终未能带领球队重夺得世界冠军，故她于1998年宣布辞职。\n在90年代，中国女排虽然出现了不少优秀球员，如副攻的赖亚文、主攻的许新、接应二传的邱爱华等，却只曾在1990年至1998年期间的四次三大女排世界冠军赛事中屈居亚军，那年代正值古巴国家女子排球队创造了八连冠的超强王朝\n。\n\n### 中兴时期\n\n（2000年至2008年）\n2000年，在教练胡进带领下，中国女排在2000年悉尼奥运会上止步八强。中国女排兵败后，中国排协便委任在中国女排队中曾担任20多年陪练员的陈忠和先生担任主教练。\n2001年，陈忠和决心重用新人，除了逐步淘汰上一代女排名将，更提拔了不少潜质新人如刘亚男、冯坤、周苏红、杨昊、赵蕊蕊等。中国女排在陈忠和教练的带领下，在日本夺得2001年女排大冠军杯赛的冠军，这是中国女排十多年来夺得的世界级正式大赛冠军。不过由于世界大冠军杯属洲际杯性质，传统地位难与三大女排世界冠军赛事相提并论，故在国内没有造成太大回响\n。中国女排接连在2001年和2002年的世界女排大奖赛决赛周进入最后决赛，分别败于美国队和俄罗斯队而无缘冠军。\n2002年，在德国举行的第十四届世界女子排球锦标赛中，中国女排利用走线策略，在两轮分组赛中分别输给实力明显较自己弱的希腊女排和韩国女排，以确保在赛事中尽量避开两大劲敌：意大利女排和俄罗斯女排。最终虽然中国女排达到了赛前所期望的前四位成绩，但却受了国内（不满女排打假的观众）和国外（巴西女排和荷兰女排）一片指责，陈忠和教练一度受到下台压力。不过在之后举行的2002年釜山亚运会中，中国女排获得冠军，陈忠和教练地位得以确保\n。\n2003年，是中国女排丰收的一年，接连夺得瑞士女排精英赛、世界女排大奖赛、亚洲女排锦标赛等几个国际赛事冠军，开始憧憬中国女排可以重夺世界冠军，终于在11月于日本举行的第九届女排世界杯中，中国女排以11战全胜的姿态勇夺冠军\n，一扫17年之痒。中国国内又重现20世纪80年代的女排热潮，女排精神一词又再度被提起。中国女排在这一年因此夺得中国最佳体育团队奖，其中中央电视台亦制作特备节目走过17年以庆祝中国女排重夺世界冠军。\n2004年雅典奥运会，中国女排成为夺冠热门，可重夺失落了20年的奥运金牌。但事实上，中国女排赛前的状态并没有在2003年时那样大熟大勇，身高1.97米、为中国女排夺得2003年世界杯的主力功臣赵蕊蕊因在一次练习中受伤而缺阵了半年，中国女排亦在较早前的世界女排大奖赛宣告卫冕失败。奥运会女排赛首战对美国女排中，赵蕊蕊便因右脚伤退出比赛，更令中国女排夺冠之路蒙上阴影。不过中国女排在其后比赛中却越战越勇，最后杀入了决赛，对手正是在2003年世界杯未能参赛的俄罗斯女排，中国女排在首两盘比赛中落后，但最终惊天逆转以3-2（28-30，25-27，25-20，25-23，15-12）战胜对手，在奥运女排赛事中折桂\n，并实现女排两连冠\n。\n2005年，中国女排延续了2004年良好的竞技状态，在亚洲女排锦标赛中卫冕成功，并获得了同年在日本举行的大冠军杯的赛事。但这次的大冠军杯，中国女排未能卫冕成功，只夺得了第三名。2006年，随着冯坤、杨昊等老队员的伤病增加，中国女排的成绩出现了下滑的迹象，仅仅在同年的女排世锦赛上取得第五名\n，连最终的四强名额都未能挤进。\n2007年，因为2008年奥运会在北京举办，作为东道主的中国女排自动获得奥运入场券，所以中国女排听取了国际排联的意见，未参加2007年的女排世界杯。2008年。随着北京奥运会的日益临近，队中的赵蕊蕊、张娜和冯坤等球员的伤愈回归，使得中国女排的整体实力得到明显的上升，但是在半决赛中依旧不敌如日中天的巴西女排，最终中国女排在北京奥运会中取得季军\n。\n\n### 低谷时期\n\n（2009年至2012年）\n2009年3月，陈忠和结束了8年的国家队教练生涯，并由国青队的蔡斌执教。6月，新一届的中国女排在中国国内举行的中国国际女排精英赛漯河站和昆山站上连获两个冠军，为新女排的出征世界大赛打响头炮。其后在2009年度的世界女排大奖赛的三站分站赛上，这支年轻的队伍以9战7胜2负的成绩（于澳门站2-3负于巴西女排；在香港站2-3负于波兰女排）获得在日本举行的世界女排大奖赛总决赛的资格\n。9月13日，蔡斌率领中国女排国家队在亚锦赛上“荣获”亚军（决赛输给泰国）创造了记录，蔡斌因此被中国排管中心取消了主教练一职。\n2010年3月25日，原天津队主教练王宝泉接替蔡斌出任中国女排主教练\n。6月13日，率领中国队获得瑞士女排精英赛冠军。9月2日，王宝泉因身体原因下课，成了历史上时间最短的教练。排管中心正式宣布任命俞觉敏出任中国女排主教练，带领中国女排夺得广州亚运会冠军和女排亚洲杯冠军。\n2011年，俞觉敏带领中国女排夺得瑞士女排精英赛季军、俄罗斯女排总统杯冠军（亚军：巴西，季军：俄罗斯），带领中国女排夺得亚洲女子排球锦标赛冠军，在世界杯上率中国女排收官战中直落三局横扫欧洲亚军德国以11战8胜3负积26分的成绩斩获季军，获得2012年伦敦奥运会的入场券\n。\n2012年，俞觉敏带领中国女排在6月底举行的世界女排大奖赛总决赛中，以1胜4负的成绩排名第五，分别以1-3负于巴西；1-3负于土耳其；2-3负于泰国；0-3负于美国。2012年伦敦奥运会上，中国女排深陷所谓的“死亡之组”，同组对手有北京奥运会冠亚军巴西队和美国队，另外还有欧洲区预选赛冠军土耳其队，新科欧锦赛冠军塞尔维亚队，最后还有亚洲老对手韩国队。然而中国女排分别以3-1战胜塞尔维亚和土耳其，虽然0-3完败美国、2-3憾负巴西，但3-2险胜韩国。最终以三胜两负的战绩排名小组第二，成功从“死亡之组”中杀出重围晋级八强。然而，到了1/4决赛，中国女排却意外输给了在奥运赛场上从未输过的日本队，无缘四强，最终并列第五\n。2012年9月16日，第三届女排亚洲杯中，中国队在决赛中苦战四局以1-3不敌泰国女排卫冕失利\n。\n\n### 重生时期\n\n（2013年-）\n2013年5月，郎平正式挂帅，再次执教中国女排\n。2013年8月11日，获得2013年世界女排大奖赛香港站冠军。2013年9月1日，获得2013年世界女排大奖赛总决赛亚军。2013年9月13日，女排亚锦赛展开首轮争夺，卫冕冠军中国女排轻松以3-0（25-11、25-16、25-17）的大比分零封伊朗，取得开门红。9月14日，中国女排迎来小组第二个对手印度，并以3-0取胜\n。在随后的比赛中，中国女排相继以3-0的相同比分战胜菲律宾、中华台北、韩国、越南杀入半决赛。可惜在半决赛和争夺三四名的比赛中以2-3负于泰国无缘决赛，2-3负于韩国无缘奖牌。使得中国女排仅列第四，首次在亚锦赛无缘三甲，这一成绩也是中国队征战该项赛事38年来的最差战绩\n。\n2014年9月12日，第四届女排亚洲杯在深圳大运中心体育馆落下帷幕，由徐建德挂帅的中国女排二队直落三局以3-0零封韩国，改写战绩为六战全胜不丢一局，继2008和2010年之后第三度夺魁\n。但在2014年10月2日的仁川亚运会女排决赛中，中国女排二队0-3不敌韩国队，未能实现亚运会“五连冠”\n。\n2014年10月12日，在世界女子排球锦标赛半决赛中，中国队面对东道主意大利女排，激战四局后以3-1（25-21、25-20、20-25、30-28）胜出，继1998年后再次杀进决赛。在中国三大球集体低迷时，郎平带领着年轻的女排姑娘又一次闯入了世锦赛女排决赛\n。10月13日，在女排世锦赛决赛中，中国女排以1-3不敌美国，屈居亚军。不过，这是中国女排自1998年后，在世锦赛取得的最佳战绩\n。\n2015年5月28日，在女排亚锦赛决赛中，中国队以3-0（25-21、25-21、25-21）战胜韩国队，时隔4年重回亚洲巅峰，同时也是中国队历史上第13次获得亚锦赛冠军\n。2015年9月6日，中国女排在2015年世界杯赛中以3-1战胜日本女排，自雅典奥运会夺冠时隔11年后，第一次拿到世界排球三大赛的冠军，这也是郎平作为主教练所得到的第一个世界冠军，同时赢得2016年里约热内卢奥运会参赛资格\n。\n2016年6月，由安家杰带队的中国女排夺得瑞士女排精英赛冠军。自1998年更名为精英赛后，此次是中国队第5次登顶，时隔6年再获冠军，也是球队里约奥运周期在该赛事的最佳战绩\n。\n2016年8月17日，在2016年里约热内卢奥运会女排1/4决赛中，中国女排3-2力克卫冕冠军、东道主巴西女排锁定4强最后1席（五局比分为15-25、25-23、25-22、22-25、15-13），巴西女排无缘奥运3连冠，中国女排时隔8年后再度打入奥运半决赛\n。8月19日，里约奥运会女排半决赛中，中国女排3-1（27-25、23-25、29-27、25-23）战胜荷兰女排，报了小组赛不敌对手的一箭之仇，时隔12年再次挺进奥运会决赛  。8月21日，里约奥运会女排决赛，中国女排在先失一局的情况下连扳三局，以3-1逆转战胜塞尔维亚女排，这是中国女排时隔12年再次获得奥运冠军，也是第三次获得奥运会金牌  。9月20日，在第5届女排亚洲杯中，中国女排二队在决赛直落三局以3-0复仇哈萨克斯坦成功卫冕，并且继2008年、2010年和2014年后荣膺第4冠\n。\n2017年8月7日，在世界女排大奖赛总决赛中，中国女排1-3输给塞尔维亚，最终以第四名收官，连续四年无缘领奖台\n。8月17日，在2017年亚洲女排锦标赛中，以年轻队员出战的中国队0-3负于韩国队，最终位列第四\n。9月9日，在日本举办的国际排联女排大冠军杯中五战全胜且在第四轮比赛中提前一轮夺冠，是中国女排时隔16年再夺女排大冠军杯冠军\n。\n2018年6月27日，在2018年世界女排联赛总决赛小组赛首轮的比赛中，中国女排在先丢一局的情况下连扳三局以3-1逆转荷兰赢得开门红，四局比分为20-25、25-21、25-22和25-18\n。7月1日，2018年世界女排联赛总决赛季军战，中国女排以3-0击败巴西队，成功复仇季军收官，三局比分为25-18、25-22和25-22，名列第3\n。9月1日，2018年雅加达亚运会女排决赛，郎平挂帅的中国女排3-0完胜泰国，8战全胜继2010年广州亚运夺冠之后时隔8年再夺冠，这也是中国女排史上第8次亚运登顶。\n10月10日，2018女排世锦赛第二轮复赛，中国女排以25-17/26-24/25-18，大比分3-0战胜强敌美国女排，7胜1负积21分，提前一轮锁定6强席位\n。\n2018年10月，首部生动讲述百年中国女排历程的图书——《阳光总在风雨后——中国女排的故事》由人民出版社出版发行\n。\n2018年10月20日，在女排世锦赛三四名决赛上，中国女排以大比分3-0完胜荷兰女排，拿下2018女排世锦赛季军。\n\n2019年5月30日，“2019年世界女排联赛中国澳门站”3-0战胜韩国女排获本站赛事冠军。\n\n2019年6月6日，“2019年世界女排联赛中国香港站”3-2力克意大利夺香港站冠军。\n\n2019年7月7日，在中国南京奥林匹克体育中心举行的2019世界女排联赛总决赛中，中国女排3比1完胜土耳其队，捧得季军。\n\n2019年8月4日晚，在宁波北仑主场，中国女排以25比18、25比12、25-18，总比分3比0战胜土耳其女排，取得了东京奥运会资格赛的三连胜，成功获得奥运资格。\n\n2019年9月14日下午，中国女排在横滨迎来了世界杯的首个对手韩国女排，以3比0拿下，取得了本届女排世界杯赛事的首场胜利。\n9月15日，在2019年女排世界杯A组次轮角逐中，中国女排以25-18、25-14、25-19，总比分3-0完胜喀麦隆女排。\n9月16日，在2019年女排世界杯第3轮争夺中，中国女排直落三局，以25-22、25-16和25-18横扫俄罗斯女排，赢得3连胜。\n9月18日，在2019年女排世界杯比赛中，中国女排发挥出色，以25-19、25-21、25-17，大比分3-0横扫多米尼加女排，四连胜。\n9月19日，在2019年女排世界杯比赛中，中国女排发挥出色，以3-0完胜东道主日本队，豪取五连胜，三局比分为25-17、25-10和25-17。本场比赛，中国女排首发是主攻朱婷、张常宁，副攻袁心玥、颜妮，接应龚翔宇，二传丁霞和自由人王梦洁。

中国国家女子排球队\n中国国家女子排球队，简称中国女排，是中华人民共和国的女子排球国家队，由中国排球协会及国家体育总局排球管理中心直接管理，是中国近代各体育运动团队中成绩最为突出的体育团队，也是目前（截至2022年7月）国际排球总会（FIVB）世界排名第五的女排国家队。\n中国女排一向是世界排坛上的劲旅之一，曾于1981年、1982年、1984年、1985年、1986年、2003年、2004年、2015年、2016年和2019年十度成为排球三大赛事的世界冠军，并于在2011年、2014年、2015年和2016年四度获得CCTV体坛风云人物评选「最佳团队奖」。现任主教练为蔡斌。\n中国女排最近的三大赛战绩为2022年世界女排锦标赛第6名、2019年女排世界杯冠军，2020年东京奥运会无缘8强。\n##阵容\n###现役球员\n2022年世界女排锦标赛中国女排14人名单\n2022年世界女排联赛总决赛中国女排14人名单\n##历史\n###早期历史\n排球何时传入中国，在正式历史文献上已经无从稽考。不过根据一些零碎资料所指出，排球最早大约在清朝末期的1905年左右，经由华南沿岸地区和香港等地传入中国内地，和排球起源相关的基督教青年会亦扮演著一定传播角色。当时广东和福建等华南沿岸各省，是中国排球发展较为蓬勃的地区，广东台山更有「排球之乡」称号。\n民国时代，排球已在中国各地广泛地发展，不过当时最主流的是9人排球，1913年第一届远东运动会，便已派队参加排球项目。\n50年代，即中华人民共和国成立后不久，那时的排球强国是苏联和其他东欧国家，而当年的国际比赛主要是6人排球，9人排球为主流的中国，便需要重新学习6人排球的规则、战略和比赛方法。中华全国体育总会便积极安排男女子排球运动员到东欧等地，参加排球比赛借以吸收经验，经过一系列的友赛，中国男女子排球运动员开始掌握6人排球的比赛方法。\n1953年，中国排球协会正式成立，张之槐先生出任主席，更在1954年成为国际排联（FIVB）的正式会员。其后，中国排球协会（以下简称中国排协）获发邀请参加1956年在法国举行的世界排球锦标赛（男子第3届、女子第2届）。\n1956年曾派女队参加在法国举行的第2届世界女排锦标赛，这次比赛中，中国女排先后击败奥地利、荷兰和联邦德国等女排队伍，获得第6名。\n碍于亚洲人身型和力量一般不及欧洲人和美洲人，中国女排的战略以快为主，凭著「前后交叉」和「快慢掩护」等战略在第2届世界女排锦标赛中取得不俗成绩。\n50年代后期，中国男子排球运动员发展出「勾手大力发球」、「上手飘球」等技术，接著中国女子排球运动员亦开始在全运会和中国排球联赛等比赛中运用这些技术。\n60年代，一股亚洲女排新势力正挑战著苏联女排的皇者地位，这股势力就是有「东洋魔女」之称的日本女排，「东洋魔女」在大松博文的教导下，在1960年的第3届世界女排锦标赛中，仅败于卫冕的苏联女排夺得亚军，却接连在两年后的第4届世界女排锦标赛和四年后的东京奥运会的决赛中击败该宿敌夺标，日本女排更在1960年后曾创下118场国际赛连胜纪录，震惊世界。「东洋魔女」的成功亦引起中国排球界的注意，于是中国排协经过周恩来总理的批准，在1965年4月邀请了大松博文来华一个月，协助训练中国女排，令中国女排得到较有系统的训练和明确的发展方针。\n虽然男女子排球在1964年的东京奥运会成为正式比赛项目，可是由于中华人民共和国尚未恢复在国际奥委会的会籍，故中国女排无缘奥运会女子排球比赛。60年代，中国更爆发多次政治运动，更令中国女排缺席了不少国际赛事。\n1974年，正值文化大革命的尾声，中国女排在第7届世界女排锦标赛中，获得第14名。及至1976年，新的中国女排国家队正式成立，袁伟民成为了中国女排的主教练。\n重组后中国女排国家队，不久就先后参加三项大型国际赛事：1977年的第2届世界杯、1978年的第8届世界女排锦标赛和曼谷亚运会，中国女排分别获得第四名、第六名和亚军，这样的成绩不单没有令中国女排气馁，反而增强了女排成为亚洲盟主的信心。\n中国女排终于在1979年的亚洲女排锦标赛中有所突破，她们在决赛以盘数3比1，击败当时的亚洲和前世界冠军日本女排，首次称霸亚洲。\n由于苏联入侵阿富汗，1980年的莫斯科奥运会遭受西方国家和中华人民共和国等抵制，原本能够参加奥运会的中国女排便失去一次参赛机会。所以，1981年的第3届世界杯正好为世界八支女子排球劲旅提供互相切磋的机会。 当时，除中国外，日本、苏联、美国等亦是夺标热门。\n###1980年代的腾飞\n####三连冠\n中国女排在袁伟民的指导下，在80年代开始腾飞。\n1981年，第3届世界杯在日本举行，比赛采用单循环制，经过了七轮二十八场比赛，中国女排以七战全胜姿态，压倒卫冕的主办国日本，获得冠军，成为中国在三大球运动（足球、篮球、排球）队伍中的首个世界冠军。 袁伟民、孙晋芳、郎平等分获最佳教练、二传和优秀球员等奖项。 是次比赛，最经典的一场是对苏联女排赢盘数3比0（局分为15-4, 16-14, 15-0），末局更令对手不能拿到一分，这个战果刚好是1978年第8届世界排球锦标赛中苏联女排击败中国女排的比分。\n1982年，中国女排参加在秘鲁举行的第9届世界排球锦标赛，初赛对美国队曾以盘数零比三落败，更一度陷入出线危机，主教练袁伟民果断起用年轻队员梁艳、郑美珠替下周晓兰、陈招娣，结果中国女排以3比0轻取古巴，赢得了扭转战局的关键一役。中国女排接连以盘数三比零直落击败匈牙利、古巴、苏联和-{zh-hans:澳大利亚; zh-hk:澳洲;}-等球队之后，夺得半决赛席位。在四强赛中，中国女排又以盘数三比零直落击败劲旅日本，而劲敌美国队则意外地被东道主秘鲁队淘汰。最终，中国女排在决赛以直落三局轻取主办国秘鲁，首次获得世界女排锦标赛冠军。\n尽管在1983年的亚洲锦标赛决赛败于日本，进入调整期的中国女排仍是洛杉矶奥运会的夺标热门。1984年，中国女排参加在洛杉矶举行的洛杉矶奥运会，虽然中国女排又在分组赛被宿敌美国队击败，其后却越战越勇，最终，中国女排在决赛以直落三局轻取主办国美国，报却分组赛一败之仇，并首次获得奥运金牌，同时亦成为女子排球三连冠。\n####五连冠\n此后两年，中国女排又获得了1985年第4届世界杯冠军和1986年第10届世界女排锦标赛冠军，成就世界女排史上首个五连冠的佳绩。\n1980年代初的中国，正是百废待兴之时，中国女排以拼搏精神赢得三连冠和五连冠的成绩，成为了当时中国人的模范和骄傲，更是中国在80年代腾飞的象征。\n1985年，主教练邓若曾带领中国女排卫冕世界杯女排赛，并在后郎平时代的中国女排加入新血，在他的治下，杨晓君、巫丹等渐渐成熟，女排顺利地做好了新老交替。 但后来因为战术理念和与球员关系不佳等问题，在1986年世界女排锦标赛开赛前2个月以生病为由请辞。\n###1990年代的下滑\n中国女排自1986年在捷克斯洛伐克夺得第10届世界女排锦标赛冠军后，开始青黄不接，早一辈的名将如郎平、梁艳等早已相继退役。1988年的汉城奥运会半决赛中败于该届冠军苏联女排，最后只获得铜牌。中国女排在1989年的第5届世界杯和1990年的第11届世界女排锦标赛均卫冕失败，决赛分别负于古巴和苏联而获得亚军。\n1992年巴塞罗那奥运会上，由于巫丹误服禁药事件，由胡进所带领的中国女排最后仅仅获得第七名。\n1994年，在巴西举行的1994年第12届世界女排锦标赛更滑落至第八名，第七名争夺战中更败于宿敌日本女排。在广岛亚运会中更在决赛败于韩国女排而卫冕失败，中国女排至此陷入低潮。\n1995年2月，前中国女排选手，“铁榔头”郎平被选为中国女排主教练，开始了她在中国女排4年多的执教生涯。在此期间，她率领中国逐步走出低谷，先后获得1996年亚特兰大奥运会亚军和1998年世界女排锦标赛亚军，并夺回了失去多年的亚洲霸主的宝座，但她始终未能带领球队重夺得世界冠军，于1998年宣布辞职。\n在90年代，中国女排虽然出现了不少优秀球员，如副攻的李月明、赖亚文和吴咏梅、主攻的许新、孙玥和王丽娜、接应二传的邱爱华等，却只曾在1990－98年期间的四次三大女排世界冠军赛事（世界杯、世界女排锦标赛、奥运会）中屈居亚军——那个年代正值古巴女排创造八连冠的超强王朝。\n###千禧年代至2010年代初期的女排中兴\n####雅典奥运周期（2001—2004年）\n#####2001年\n2000年在教练胡进带领下的中国女排在悉尼奥运会在八强止步，兵败悉尼之后，中国排协便委任在中国女排队中曾担任十多年陪练员的陈忠和担任主教练。在他的领导下，诞生了后来重夺世界冠军的中国女排黄金二代。\n2001年，陈忠和决心重用新人，除了逐步淘汰上一代女排名将，更提拔了不少潜质新人如刘亚男、冯坤、周苏红、杨昊等。结果，中国女排在陈忠和教练领导下，在日本夺得冠军，这是中国女排十多年来夺得的世界级正式大赛冠军。不过由于世界大冠军杯属洲际杯性质，传统地位难与三大女排世界冠军赛事相提并论，故在国内没有造成太大回响。\n另外，中国女排亦接连在2001年和2002年的世界女排大奖赛决赛周进入最后决赛，分别败于美国队和俄罗斯队而无缘冠军。\n#####2002年：打假球风波\n2002年，在德国举行的2002 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship中，中国女排涉嫌利用走线策略，在两轮分组赛中分别输给实力明显较自己较弱的希腊女排和韩国女排，以确保在赛事中尽量避开两大劲敌——意大利女排和俄罗斯女排。由于最后一轮首圈（A-D组）小组赛中，D组开赛时间最迟，中国队先在D组小组赛故意输给实力明显较弱的希腊队，让自己取得小组次名出线以便进入次圈（E-G组）小组赛中最弱的F组（对手: 韩国、保加利亚、波多黎各），结果令原来在此组被中国队击败的巴西队升上小组首名，巴西队埋怨原本已为次圈进入F组对韩国队等做准备，结果被送至G组去对美国、荷兰、东道主德国等队伍。中国队继而在F组小组赛故意输给也是实力明显较弱的韩国队，导致荷兰队被韩国队抢去最佳小组第3名出线八强淘汰赛的名额，巴西队则埋怨要和中国队作赛两次，而保加利亚队更埋怨中国队将他们送去打比巴西队更强的俄罗斯队。 这次风波，也导致中国女排和其他数队女排国家队关系恶化。最终虽然中国女排达到了赛前所期望的前四位成绩，但却受了国内（不满女排打假的观众）和国外（巴西女排和荷兰女排）的一片指责，陈忠和教练一度受到下台压力。由于让球事件搞乱了世锦赛的正常秩序，也激怒了东道主德国，世界排坛哗然。后来，女排就此事专门向世界排联和全国球迷写了道歉信。\n不过，在十天后举行的釜山亚运会，中国女排获得冠军，陈忠和教练地位得以确保。\n#####2003年\n2003年是中国女排丰收的一年，接连夺得瑞士女排精英赛、世界女排大奖赛、亚洲女排锦标赛等几个国际赛事冠军。一时间，国人憧憬中国女排可以重夺世界冠军。在十一月于日本举行的第9届世界杯中，中国女排以十一战全胜的姿态勇夺冠军，一扫十七年之痒。 国内又重现八十年代的女排热潮，女排精神一词又再度被提起。 中国女排亦因此夺得中国最佳体育团队奖。 中国中央电视台亦制作特别节目走过十七年，以庆祝中国女排重夺世界冠军。主教练陈忠和获颁2003年度感动中国人物。\n#####2004年（奥运年）\n雅典奥运会在2004年举行，国人期待中国女排重夺失落了20年的奥运金牌。事实上，中国女排赛前的状态并没有在2003年时那样大热大勇，身高1.97米、为中国女排夺得2003年世界杯的主力功臣赵蕊蕊因在一次练习中受伤而缺阵了半年，中国女排亦在较早前的世界女排大奖赛宣告卫冕失败。国内一时间又出现一种言论：中国女排夺得03年世界杯有很大的幸运成份，皆因劲敌俄罗斯女排因故未能参赛，又正值各国女排的交接期，故中国女排才能够顺利夺冠。奥运会女排赛赛前，陈忠和教练亦表明现今世界各国女排实力十分接近，未敢轻言中国女排能够夺标而回，首战对美国女排赛事开局3分钟后，赵蕊蕊便因右脚伤退出比赛，更令中国女排夺冠之路蒙上阴影。\n不过中国女排在其后比赛中却越战越勇，在小组赛上以5战4胜1负的成绩以小组第一名的成绩进入淘汰赛，在之后又以3：0轻松横扫四分之一决赛的对手日本女排；在半决赛上中国女排迎来了在小组赛上曾以3：2战胜过自己的古巴女排，经过前四局的激战双方战成2：2，在决胜局上双方进行4号位的强攻大战，中国队的拦网在此时发挥了巨大的功效，她们接连拦住了对方的三大主攻手：队长鲁伊兹、奥尔蒂兹、和老将桑切斯的强力扣杀。最后以15：10的比分拿下决胜局，时隔8年后再次杀入了奥运会的女排决赛。\n而中国女排决赛的对手正是在03年世界杯未能参赛的俄罗斯女排，对方在半决赛上神奇的将曾拿到过7个赛点的巴西女排拉下马。决赛在雅典当地时间晚上8：10正式开始，俄罗斯女排在决赛中的表现出奇的沉稳，她们并没有一开始便用队伍中的两门“大炮”——主攻手Gamova和Sokolova，而是频频利用副攻和接应二传的跑动进攻，同时又将中国女排的看门绝技快攻盯死，这一变化让中国队一时难以适应，在前两局中被俄罗斯队连下两城。但凭借“女排精神”的顽强拼搏和现场为中国女排摇旗呐喊的支持者的加油声，最终经过2小时19分钟的鏖战，中国女排惊天逆转反胜对手盘数三比二（28-30, 25-27, 25-20, 25-23, 15-12），继1984年洛杉矶奥运会后时隔20年再次在奥运女排赛事中折桂，并实现了女排两连冠，中国女排亦因此再度夺得中国最佳体育团队奖。\n雅典奥运女排夺冠最后一球的详细情形：cquote 2|俄罗斯队14号接应二传Plotnikova发球，中国队接应二传7号周苏红一传到位，二传队长2号冯坤背传二号位，18号副攻张萍一个“时间差”战术进攻，俄罗斯队主攻手15号Sokolova单人拦回三米线，被中国队副攻4号刘亚男防起；冯坤将球甩到四号位，主攻手9号张越红扣球被Sokolova防起，俄罗斯队二传Shenshennina将球传给四号位，Sokolova开网强攻被中国队前排队员冯坤和张萍拦网撑起；后排主攻手3号杨昊倒地飞身救球，周苏红跪地插上将球垫传到四号位，张越红再次扣球被俄罗斯前排队员副攻9号Tishchenko和Shenshennina拦网撑起，Sokolova一传半到位，Shenshennina飞身插上将球高高垫起，Plotnikova顺势将球推往中国队的一号位；中国队周苏红一传到位，冯坤再次将球送到四号位，一个快速的平拉开，张越红手起球落，最后将球狠狠砸在了俄罗斯队六号位的空挡处。\n####北京奥运周期（2005—2008年）\n#####2005年\n此后两年，中国女排受伤病和年龄等因素困扰，实力有所倒退。雅典奥运会后，中国女排屡次败于宿敌巴西队和意大利队。虽然中国女排在俄罗斯总统杯女排邀请赛决赛中击败东道主俄罗斯女排，首度夺标，却在世界女排大奖赛决赛阶段只获第五名。\n#####2006年\n在2006年的第15届世界女排锦标赛上先后败于俄罗斯队、德国队、巴西队和荷兰队，最终在八强争夺战中击败古巴队和日本队，取得了第五名，未能再度实现三连冠。不少网民认为陈忠和教练在雅典奥运会后两年内较少给予新人机会导致成绩下滑，但陈忠和仍然坚持以老将为主参加多哈亚运会。\n在多哈亚运会中，中国女排接连以直落三盘击败越南、中华台北、韩国、蒙古等队伍，成功进入决赛，并且在先失一盘的情况下，惊险地以3比1反胜宿敌日本（比分：22-25, 25-10, 25-23, 25-16），成功卫冕亚运会女子排球冠军。\n#####2007年\n由于中国是2008年奥运会的主办国，中国女排直接晋身奥运会，而2007年的第十届世界杯却是北京奥运会的女排比赛的-{zh-hans:资格赛;zh-hk:外围赛;zh-tw:资格赛;}-之一，经国际排联的协调，中国女排宣布放弃卫冕。这年，陈忠和开始多用新人，薛明、魏秋月、徐云丽、张娴、李娟等年青或二线球员得以有充分机会磨练，老将如冯坤和杨昊亦得到养伤机会。\n中国女排在中国国际女排精英赛两个赛站夺得冠军，其后在瑞士女排精英赛决赛中，以直落盘数三比零击败古巴女排夺标，更在俄罗斯总统杯女排邀请赛决赛中，以盘数三比一击败荷兰女排，成功卫冕。不过之前四个冠军含金量低，所面对的对手都不强，被称得上世界一流的只有俄罗斯和古巴两支队伍，俄罗斯亦没派出主力，所以中国队都没有跟真正高手过招。\n在2007年世界女排大奖赛分站赛中，年轻的中国队成绩差强人意，在前后三站接连输给俄罗斯和意大利，还有原被认为只属二流球队的荷兰和波兰，分站成绩只是两次第三和一次第二，分站总排名更低至第八，是陈家军执教以来第一次无缘分站冠军；若不是东道主举办总决赛，中国队可能无缘这次总决赛。不过，在宁波举行的总决赛中，中国女排的表现却脱胎换骨，除首战以盘数二比三败于黑马荷兰外，接连以三比二战胜波兰、克星意大利及以三比零爆冷姿态战胜小组赛中以三比一战胜中国的俄罗斯及分站总排名第一巴西队，从而以4胜1负的成绩获得总决赛亚军。\n正当大奖赛成绩的猛进及世界排名跃至第二位，中国女排在亚洲女排锦标赛中表现欠佳。在冠亚军决赛上更以0-3输给日本队只获得亚军，这是自1986年来中国女排首次丢掉亚洲女排锦标赛冠军。\n#####2008年（奥运年）\n中国女排主力在2007-2008年初饱受伤患困扰，其间冯坤、杨昊、赵蕊蕊等更在现任美国女排主帅郎平安排下在美国治疗，故成绩不佳。2008年中，主力们陆续康复，中国女排也以较完整阵容参加各项比赛。在瑞士女排精英赛中，中国女排仅负于状态上升中的古巴，获得亚军。\n中国女排又在大奖赛分站取得八连胜，只在最后一场败于巴西女排得第2名出线，不过在总决赛接连败于传统对手意大利、古巴、美国、巴西，仅凭借战胜东道主日本而排名第5位。\n中国北京主办2008年的夏季奥运会，踌躇满志的中国女排占主场之利，自然被认为是夺标大热。\n这回，中国女排保留六名上届奥运冠军旧将，并加入王一梅、徐云丽、李娟、魏秋月、薛明、马蕴雯。可是背负沉重卫冕压力的中国女排，在分组赛表现差强人意，对古巴女排先胜2盘再负3盘而落败，对美国女排同样先胜后败，只能击败实力较弱的日本、波兰、委内瑞拉，以小组第3名出线。\n在八强，中国面对上届亚军俄罗斯，结果轻松以盘数3-0晋级。在四强却以盘数0-3败于巴西女排而无缘卫冕，不过在季军战却复仇古巴女排成功，以盘数3-1击败对手获得铜牌，挽回声誉。\n####伦敦奥运周期（2009—2012年）\n#####2009年\n2009年3月，陈忠和结束了8年的国家队教练生涯，并由国青队的蔡斌执教。据报，蔡斌在执教国青队时，其成员包括王一梅、薛明、马蕴雯、魏秋月、李娟以及徐云丽，均为他的弟子，加上他在掌管国青队的10年内，先后两度取得亚军和季军，故能成为新一任的女排教练。\n2009年6月，新一届的中国女排在中国国内举行的中国国际女排精英赛漯河站和昆山站上连获两个冠军，为新女排的出征世界大赛打响头炮。\n但在接下来在瑞士举行的瑞士女排精英赛上，她们却接连在小组赛和半决赛上以0：3的大比分输给了巴西和意大利，最后获得第三名。在紧接着举行的2009意大利女排四国邀请赛上居然在小组赛和半决赛两负弱旅日本队，最后获得第三名。主教练蔡斌首次受到质疑。\n其后在2009年度的世界女排大奖赛的三站分站赛上，这支年轻的队伍以9战7胜2负的成绩（于澳门站2：3负于巴西女排；在香港站2：3负于波兰女排）获得在日本举行世界女排大奖赛总决赛的资格，但是在日本举办的大奖赛总决赛周上，中国女排却以仅战胜以东道主身份进入决赛阶段的日本女排，6战1胜5负的成绩获得第五名，平了大奖赛历史最差成绩，主教练蔡斌的指教风格再次受到质疑。\n9月13日在越南河内进行的亚洲女子排球锦标赛决赛中，中国女排以1：3爆冷不敌本届比赛的最大黑马泰国女排，继2007年后再度失去冠军宝座，意外的失利顷刻引起全国媒体一片哗然，主教练蔡斌一时成为舆论的焦点，球迷“下课”之声如潮。\n#####2010年\n2010年3月25日，由于蔡斌率领的女排战绩异常糟糕，排球中心宣布接受其辞呈，改任王宝泉接任中国女排主帅职务。2010年5月底，在王宝泉带领下的新一届中国女排在国内举行的两站国际女排精英赛上表现差强人意，获得了一站亚军和一站冠军。（由于主力二传魏秋月伤病未能上场，所以在漯河站输给了从未输过的多米尼加女排）\n2010年6月，在瑞士女排精英赛上，这支年轻的中国女排以5胜1负的成绩重夺了该项赛事的冠军。这是中国女排继2000年、2003年、2007年后第四次获得了该项赛事的冠军，也因此超过了古巴女排成为该项赛事成绩最好的队伍。\n2010年8月，中国女排在2010世界女排大奖赛分组赛上以9战6胜3负的成绩进入了在中国宁波的总决赛，在总决赛上虽然中国女排力克实力稍逊的日本、波兰两队，但是面对其余三支强队意大利、美国、巴西时均以0:3败下阵来，最后获得了总决赛第四名的成绩。\n2010年8月29日，上任仅161天的第十任中国女排主教练王宝泉在世界女排大奖赛后以“身体原因，压力过大”为由辞去了主教练的职务，成为中国女排历史上任期最短的一任主教练。\n2010年9月15日，中国排协召开新闻发布会正式宣布，聘请原中国女排助理教练俞觉敏正式担任中国女排主教练，直至伦敦奥运会，赖亚文出任俞觉敏助手，领队胡进兼任中国女排教练。俞觉敏上任后召回了老将周苏红为即将在年底举行的2010女排世锦赛做准备，9月底在江苏太仓举行的第二届女排亚洲杯卫冕了冠军。\n同年11月在日本举行的2010世界女排锦标赛上，尽管中国队分组不错，提前避开了几个强队，但是由于新教练俞觉敏仓促上阵临场指挥经验不足，再加上核心攻手王一梅的状态不好，导致在小组赛上接连负于土耳其、韩国、和俄罗斯队，最后仅以小组第四的身份勉强进入第二轮；在第二轮的比赛中虽然战胜了之前小组赛五连胜气势如虹的东道主日本女排，但是又意外败于塞尔维亚女排，导致进入四强的机会破灭，最后以两阶段累积的3胜4负的成绩排名小组第六，只能去争夺第九名，在9-12名的排名赛上，中国女排战胜了老对手——同是这次比赛欠佳的昔日劲旅古巴女排，但最后却在第九名争夺战中0:3完败于波兰，最终名列第十名，这是中国女排近30年来在排球三大赛上取得的最差成绩。\n在结束了令人失望的女排世锦赛后，中国女排又马不停蹄地赶往广州，参加第十六届亚运会的比赛。在决赛当中，中国女排再次面对之前在女排世锦赛上0:3负于对手的韩国女排。在比赛当中韩国队先发制人以大比分2:0领先，将中国队逼入绝境；但是，之后中国队触底反弹开了大反攻，先是连下两局将大比分扳平为2:2，又在决胜局12:14对方拿到两个金牌点的情况下在老将周苏红的带领下连得四分，拿下金牌，实现再一次的惊天大逆转。这场比赛对30年来处于最低谷的中国女排来说不得不说是一剂强心针，让充满困难的这一年终于画上了一个较为完满的句号。\n#####2011年\n2011年初，曾于2010大奖赛期间受伤的小将惠若琪伤愈复出。小将杨婕被改造为强力接应。6月新组建的中国女排在瑞士女排精英赛的半决赛中被日本二队3比0横扫，一时举国哗然，虽获得铜牌但仍然让很多球迷不满。7月俄罗斯总统杯邀请赛中小组全胜，半决赛3比0战胜缺席了2010世锦赛绝对主力加莫娃和索科洛娃的俄罗斯队，决赛中3比2战胜巴西二队，收获本年度的第一个冠军。比赛中新人杨珺菁表现不俗取代老将薛明。此后传出薛明心脏有早搏现象被退回北京疗养。但在本年的大奖赛小组赛中国队接连以1比3及0比3，先后不敌塞尔维亚和美国。3比1，3比2艰难取胜实力并不突出的哈萨克斯坦和德国队，最中以第七名的成绩晋级总决赛。总决赛的小组赛中三连败未能出线，（2比3塞尔维亚、1比3泰国、0比3俄罗斯）。和泰国的首局创造了12比25的悬殊比分也成为了中泰交手的最差纪录，再次震惊全国球迷。7-8名排位赛中再次以2比3负于克星意大利队，排名第八也成为历届大奖赛中国队的最差成绩。\n9月参加第十六届女排亚锦赛。之前的集训中招回曾两次入选国家队大名单的上海接应张磊及大奖赛阶段退回云南队的自由人张娴，重新改回跑动接应的路线。小组赛三个三比零拿下朝鲜、印度和哈萨克斯坦。复赛也连续两个三比零轻取伊朗和东道主中华台北，淘汰赛直落三局拿下越南。期间王一梅腰部扭伤，半决赛王一梅坚持上场，3比1较为轻松的击败了主力二传金萨妮副攻梁孝真缺阵的韩国队，使中国队顺利晋级十一月的第十一届女排世界杯。时隔四年与日本队再度会师决赛，日本队世锦赛功勋大友爱井上香织接连受伤阵容不整。加上中国队临时变阵拼命要夺回亚锦赛冠军，一传被中国队严重破坏，强攻接连被中国队拦死。期间第三局末段中国队对中华台北的二裁判罚有争议，日本队27比25扳回这一局。但最终中国队3比1获胜，夺下自己的第十二个亚锦赛冠军。赛后，主教练俞觉敏发表评论，指全队的信心大增，也通过人员调整找到了应对亚洲球队的方法，但亦承认球队队员还很年轻，还要面临很多困难，表现仍会有起伏。\n本届世界杯，由于中国队09之后水平不断下滑，被东道主日本安排在了同一小组。赛程先易后难较为有利。广岛站首战非锦赛亚军阿尔及利亚直落三局拿下。次战克星意大利，中国队2比1领先后，第四局开局张磊腿抽筋下场休息，中国队连续换人暂停致使场上队员注意力不集中，老将领衔的意大利队迅速拉开比分，再度扳平比局数；第五局中国队8比4领先的情况下又一次被逆转——意大利继续保持着2008大奖赛总决赛后对中国在国际排联组织的比赛里不败。三战东道主日本，日本队副攻和接应的位置上分别换上新人岩坂名奈和新锅理沙。日本队找人发球凑效导致中国队一度快攻哑火强攻连续被拦。最终中国队顶住压力，决胜局杨珺菁背飞命中15比13险胜，中国3:2险胜日本。之后连续战胜多米尼加阿根廷全取三分。札幌站2比3不敌世界第一巴西，随后全取三分拿下队容不整意在锻炼年轻队员的塞尔维亚、韩国。东京站落后两局的情况下硬将美国拖入决胜局。最后两场比赛直落三局击败肯尼亚、德国，中国队8胜3负积26分夺得铜牌直通伦敦奥运会。\n本届世界杯，中国女排取得何种成绩并未被过多人看好。亚锦赛中中国队在一传、防守小球串联等环节上未有太多改观，中国女排承受了外界的质疑出征世界杯。然而，比赛结束后，中国女排的表现让人刮目相看。\n世界杯的铜牌填补了2009、2010两年中国队在国际排联组织比赛中的奖牌荒。3金3铜1银，中国队成为世界杯奖牌数最多的队伍。俞觉敏也因2011年度亚锦赛冠军世界杯季军成功渡过了世锦赛第十大奖赛垫底的信任危机。一个月的时间从大奖赛垫底重返亚洲第一、世界前三，中国女排也证明了自己是支有底蕴的球队。小将杨珺菁惠若琪大赛首秀出色得到锻炼，老将徐云丽发挥抢眼。中国队终于找到一套较为理想的阵容备战伦敦奥运会。经历两年的低迷后，中国女排开始逐渐恢复元气。\n#####2012年（奥运年）\n2012年6月，俞觉敏带领的中国女排于世界女排大奖赛总决赛中，以1胜4负的成绩排名第五，分别以1:3负于巴西、1:3负于土耳其、2:3负于泰国及0:3负于美国。同年的伦敦奥运会小组赛中，中国女排分别以3:1战胜塞尔维亚和土耳其、0:3负于美国、2:3负于巴西及3:2险胜韩国，以三胜两负的成绩晋级八强。其后却负于日本队无缘四强，最终排列第五。\n9月16日，中国女排于第3届亚锦赛决赛中，以1:3负于泰国女排，夺得亚军。\n###2010年代中后期之后的复苏/再度腾飞\n####里约奥运周期（2013—2016年）\n#####2013年\n2013年4月25日，郎平接任俞觉敏，再度出任中国国家女子排球队主教练。8月11日，获得2013年世界女排大奖赛香港站冠军。9月1日，获得2013年世界女排大奖赛总决赛亚军。同月举行的亚锦赛中，以3:0战胜伊朗、印度、菲律宾、中华台北、韩国及越南，却于半决赛以2:3负于泰国，其后的三四名名次赛中再以2:3负于韩国，首次在亚锦赛无缘三甲，这一成绩也是中国队于该项赛事38年来的最差战绩。\n#####2014年\n2014年世界女排大奖赛分站赛中，中国女排连胜意大利及日本等队伍，以第二名成绩进入总决赛。总决赛中在以全替补阵容出赛下，最终名列第五名。10月进行的世界女排锦标赛中，中国女排于六强小组赛中在0:2落后的情况下最终战胜多米尼加女排，进入四强。半决赛战胜主办国意大利女排，最终于决赛中不敌美国女排获得亚军，也是继1998年之后再次获得世锦赛亚军。同时，以徐建德为主教练的中国女排二队出征了韩国亚运会，于决赛负于全主力出战的主办国韩国，获得亚军。\n#####2015年\n于2015年女排亚锦赛中，主办国的中国女排于分组赛全胜进入半决赛，在半决赛中以3:1击败泰国，在决赛以3:0战胜韩国，第十三次于该项赛事夺得金牌。同年的女排世界杯上，队长惠若琪由于心脏问题未能出赛，加上之前受伤的杨方旭及徐云丽，中国女排未能全阵出战，最终却以10胜1负的成绩夺取冠军，相隔11年再夺世界冠军头衔，也是郞平教练生涯中首个世界冠军。朱婷当选赛事最有价值球员。主教练郎平获颁2015年度感动中国人物。\n#####2016年（奥运年）\n进入2016年，中国女排由于率先获得奥运会入场券，集训时间也有所提前，郎平教练致力于打磨出最佳的12人阵容征战奥运会，在二传，接应，主攻，自由人等多个位置上进行了多种人员调配的试验。在2016年女排大奖赛上，中国女排表现出色，北仑站3:1击败美国队，澳门站3:0击败巴西队（同时也终结了对对手的18连败），只是在香港站最后一场0:3负于全主力的美国队，8胜1负晋级总决赛。总决赛上中国女排派出年轻的二线阵容，连败于荷兰和美国，最终五六名决赛击败东道主泰国获得第五名。\n里约奥运会，主教练郎平在一系列的热身赛之后确认了中国女排出征奥运会的大名单，原主力二传沈静思和接应曾春蕾均落选，中国队以年轻阵容征战奥运会，队中只有魏秋月，徐云丽和惠若琪参加过奥运会。小组赛中国队分到了B组，和世界杯亚军塞尔维亚，世界第一美国队，欧洲劲旅荷兰和意大利分在了同一组。小组赛首轮，中国队在2:1领先的情况下被荷兰队逆转。之后对阵意大利和波多黎各，中国队均轻松获胜，确保了小组出线。小组赛第四轮，中国队0:3惨败于塞尔维亚队，有两局比分没有超过20分。中国女排最后一轮对阵美国女排，尽管状态有回升，仍然以1:3被美国队逆转，以B组小组排名第4出线的不利情况下惊险晋级。淘汰赛（1/4决赛）中国队对阵A组第一，全胜且未失一局的东道主巴西女排，中国队首局仅获15分，郎平教练果断变阵，派上多名年轻球员，最终3:2逆转力克卫冕冠军东道主巴西队，进入四强。半决赛中，中国队对阵荷兰队，比赛进行的异常激烈，每局最终分差都为两分，中国队由于在关键分上的把握更胜一筹，3:1险胜对手晋级决赛，核心朱婷单场得分达到33分。决赛对阵黑马塞尔维亚女排，首局落败后郎平再次变阵，中国女排在发球，拦网和防守上给了对手更大压力，包括有效抑制了塞尔维亚队的进攻核心米哈伊洛维奇，最终中国女排3:1战胜对手，继雅典奥运会后时隔12年再度获得金牌夺得奥运会女排冠军。核心朱婷荣膺最佳主攻和MVP（最有价值球员），自由人林莉也入选了最佳阵容。\n此比赛后来于2020年搬上银幕，成为电影夺冠的结局剧情。\n####东京奥运周期（2017-2021年）\n#####2017年\n2017年，新的奥运周期正式开始，中国女排出现少许变动，郎平升任为总教练，是中国女排首次设立的职位，而助理教练安家杰升任为执行教练。同时，中国排协公布了新的奥运周期首份国家队集训名单，在达到25人的名单中，保留了里约奥运的9名冠军成员，同时有9名新人首次入选。而球队新核心朱婷则首次被委任成为队长。\n2017年9月，中国女排在相隔16年之后再度参加世界大冠军杯。为应战各洲份的冠军队伍，中国女排调整阵容，部分年初未有参加集训的老将回归阵中，最终全主力出战的中国女排五战全胜，获得冠军，亦是继2001年后再夺得世界大冠军杯的冠军。\n#####2018年\n2018年，手术后的郎平重回中国女排主教练位置。在8月，带领主力阵容参加亚运会，最终八战全胜并不失一局下，重夺亚运会金牌。\n同年的十月至十一月，四年一度的世界女排锦标赛在日本举行，作为这个周期三大赛的开始。中国女排阵容维持了里约夺冠的骨架，里约金牌成员除惠若琪、魏秋月、徐云丽三位退役老将和因禁药禁赛的杨方旭，其他成员悉数入围，新加入的成员除了15年世界杯就在阵中的曾春蕾、王梦洁，补充了主攻李盈莹，二传姚迪，副攻杨涵玉、胡铭媛。赛前郎平表示中国女排实力只在5-6名。中国女排世锦赛第一阶段与意大利、土耳其、保加利亚、加拿大、古巴同组，中国队较为轻松的击败其他对手后，以1:3被艾格努领衔的意大利队逆转，第一阶段小组第二出线。第二阶段中国女排与美国、俄罗斯、泰国、阿塞拜疆同组，中国女排表现出色，第二阶段全胜，特别是3:0击败了里约奥运周期的苦主美国队，第二阶段仍排名小组第二出线，且在可以通过默契球做掉美国队的情况下仍然选择战胜俄罗斯，令美国成功出线。六强赛中国与荷兰、美国同组，中国队3:2再次击败美国队，与荷兰携手进入四强。半决赛中国对阵意大利，前两局打成1:1后，第三局中国队领先情况下全队失误增多，被意大利大比分击败，第四局中国队苦战逆转对手。第五局中国队凭借朱婷前排的进攻和艾格努的失误追到15:15，却在最后一球被艾格努先防后攻，15:17无缘三连冠。三四名决赛中国队首发李盈莹，轻松击败荷兰队，获得第三名。朱婷被评为当届世锦赛最佳主攻，颜妮获评最佳副攻。遗憾的是朱婷无缘当届世锦赛MVP，错失了MVP大满贯良机（本届世锦赛MVP授予冠军队塞尔维亚的进攻核心接应博斯科维奇）。中国女排本届世锦赛两连败意大利，技术全面又有绝对强点的意大利队成为中国队新周期的苦主。赛后郎平表示能够获得铜牌已经是打破赛前订立的目标，亦表述了球队现时的一些问题，例如：里约周期的部分老将退役令部分在队中只有数年资历的球员需要顶上，但相比老将，技术仍然显得有些幼嫩；同时亦认同球队的进攻点不能只依靠朱婷，需要有更多人的分担。\n#####2019年\n2019年世界女排联赛分站赛，中国女排最终凭借12胜3负，积分35分的战绩，位列分站赛第一名。夺得了澳门站、香港站、江门站、北仑站四个分站赛的冠军。特别是在香港站五局击败意大利。在南京女排联赛总决赛中，中国以二线阵容出战，首战告负土耳其后却击败全主力的意大利队进入四强，虽半决赛不敌美国队，但铜牌战复仇土耳其，摘得铜牌。\n2019年8月2至4日，2020东京奥运会女排资格赛展开，中国女排在主场先后应战三支欧洲球队：捷克、德国、土耳其，面对本分组最主要对手土耳其，中国女排拼劲十足，以3:0击败对手，获得三场胜利，顺利取得东京奥运的入场券。\n2019年9月，中国女排参加2019年世界杯女子排球赛，阵容相比较世锦赛，补充了主攻刘晏含，副攻王媛媛、郑益昕，胡铭媛被调整出队。本届世界杯由于不涉及奥运名额，且与女排欧锦赛时间过于接近，塞尔维亚队只派出二线阵容，中国女排强敌意大利没有获得世界杯参赛资格。中国女排取得11连胜战绩累计32分，特别是3:0击败美国队，全程中国队只失三局（巴西二局，荷兰一局），成功卫冕世界杯冠军，也是第五次世界杯夺冠。朱婷蝉联MVP也获得最佳主攻，颜妮获颁最佳副攻，丁霞最佳二传，王梦洁最佳自由人。由于中国队世界杯夺冠适逢中华人民共和国成立70周年，女排夺冠得到了广泛报道和关注，中国女排受邀参加70周年国庆招待会获得中共中央总书记习近平接见，并登上70周年群众游行最后一辆花车。\n#####2020年/2021年（奥运年）\n2020年（东京）夏季奥运会因2019冠状病毒病疫情推迟到2021年夏季；原应于2020年5月举办的世界女排联赛也因该疫情取消，改在2021年举行。\n2021年5月1日，中国女排在东京奥运会排球测试赛中以3比0击败日本队。\n2021年5月25日世界女排联赛在意大利里米尼开赛，预赛阶段最初几个星期的比赛中，中国女排派出的阵容中不包括主力队员朱婷、袁心玥、颜妮、丁霞、龚翔宇和李盈莹。这个阵容的中国女排在5月25日至6月8日的9场比赛中4胜5负，包括史上首次负于加拿大女排和比利时女排，比分均为2比3，但在6月8日赛事中3比2战胜主力阵容参赛的巴西女排。主力队员朱婷、袁心玥、颜妮、丁霞、龚翔宇和李盈莹于6月9日前抵达赛事举办地意大利里米尼，，归队参加了6月12日至20日的比赛，6场比赛除了对阵多米尼加女排时以3比1取胜，其余均为3比0胜对手，包括最后一天战胜此前预赛中14场全胜、居积分榜首的美国女排。中国女排在此次世界女排联赛预赛阶段的最终成绩是10胜5负，积分榜位居第五，无缘前四名，因而不能参加最后赛段四强的半决赛和决赛；进入四强的队伍最后赛段决赛的结果：冠军美国女排、亚军巴西女排、第三名土耳其女排、第四名日本女排。在国际排球联合会新的世界排名积分系统中，中国女排的积分受此次世界女排联赛预赛阶段几个负场的影响，世界排名由第一曾降至第三，目前（2021年6月）为第二。\n2021年7月25日东京奥运会女排开赛。受朱婷、颜妮伤病等诸多不利因素的影响，中国女排出师不利，在小组赛先后以0-3输给土耳其和美国女排，2-3输给俄罗斯奥委会女排，3战之后仅得1分。虽然其后中国女排以3:0战胜劲旅意大利女排，但由于排在小组第五名而无缘晋级8强。这也创造了中国女排自有奥运记录以来最差的战绩。在东京奥运女排赛开赛前，中国女排积分已损失最少17分，世界排名从第二下降至第三，被巴西女排反超。\n####巴黎奥运周期（2022-2024年）\n#####2022年\n东京奥运后，郎平宣布不会继续执教国家队，并打算展开退休生活。中国排协其后公开选聘巴黎奥运周期的中国女排主教练。经过甄选和考虑后，在2月3日宣布聘任江苏女排主帅蔡斌为新一任国家队主教练。\n2月17日，国家女排训练营在宁波北仑开营。67名球员及10多名教练员团队、科技与测试服务团队、体能团队等参加了此次训练营。训练营为期三个星期，其后会从中挑选部分球员进入首期集训的大名单，以备战当年的亚运会、世界女排联赛及世界女排锦标赛。4月14日，中国排协公布国家女排本年的第二期集训大名单，全部球员均参加过之前的训练营，此20人名单中仅保留五个曾参加东京奥运会的球员，大部分以新人为主。5月，国际排球联合会在其官网上公布了参加2022年世界女排联赛的球员大名单，中国女排为袁心玥等24人，朱婷和张常宁因伤病等原因不在此名单内。\n7月，2022年国家排球联赛（世界女排联赛）中国女排在分站赛结束时名列第4进入总决赛，总决赛1/4决赛中国女排1-3负于全主力出战的意大利女排，无缘四强半决赛，在国际排球联合会世界排名积分锐减7.87分，被意大利女排反超，近年首次跌出三甲落至第4。此届国家排球联赛总决赛结束后最终排名，意大利女排获冠军，巴西女排获亚军，塞尔维亚女排第3名，土耳其女排第4，美国女排第5；中国女排第6创4届比赛新低。\n##成绩和荣誉\n###世界冠军纪录\n直至2019年，中国女排共夺得十次世界冠军：\n##近期赛程\n下表仅列出由国家一队参加的比赛，一队以外参加的比赛不纪录在内。"],

{"name": "小型计算机系统接口", "documents": ["同义词\n小型计算机系统接口（计算机专业术语）一般指iSCSI\n\niSCSI（Internet Small Computer System Interface，发音为/ˈаɪskʌzi/），Internet小型计算机系统接口，又称为IP-SAN，是一种基于因特网及SCSI-3协议下的存储技术，由IETF提出，并于2003年2月11日成为正式的标准。\n\n## 简介\n\niSCSI（Internet Small Computer System Interface，发音为/ˈаɪskʌzi/），Internet小型计算机系统接口，又称为IP-SAN，是一种基于因特网及SCSI-3协议下的存储技术，由IETF提出，并于2003年2月11日成为正式的标准。与传统的SCSI技术比较起来，iSCSI技术有以下三个革命性的变化：\n1. 把原来只用于本机的SCSI协议透过TCP/IP网络发送，使连接距离可作无限的地域延伸；\n2. 连接的服务器数量无限（原来的SCSI-3的上限是15）；\n3. 由于是服务器架构，因此也可以实现在线扩容以至动态部署。\n\n## 功能\n\niSCSI利用了TCP/IP的port 860 和 3260 作为沟通的渠道。透过两部计算机之间利用iSCSI的协议来交换SCSI命令，让计算机可以透过高速的局域网集线来把SAN模拟成为本地的储存装置。\niSCSI使用 TCP/IP 协议（一般使用TCP端口860和3260）。 本质上，iSCSI 让两个主机通过 IP 网络相互协商然后交换SCSI命令。这样一来，iSCSI 就是用广域网仿真了一个常用的高性能本地存储总线，从而创建了一个存储局域网（SAN）。不像某些 SAN 协议，iSCSI 不需要专用的电缆；它可以在已有的交换和 IP 基础架构上运行。然而，如果不使用专用的网络或者子网（ LAN 或者 VLAN ），iSCSI SAN 的部署性能可能会严重下降。于是，iSCSI 常常被认为是光纤通道（Fiber Channel）的一个低成本替代方法，而光纤通道是需要专用的基础架构的。但是，基于以太网的光纤通道（FCoE）则不需要专用的基础架构。\n虽然 iSCSI 可以与任意类型的 SCSI 设备进行通信，系统管理员几乎总是使用它来连接服务器计算机 （例如，数据库服务器） 和磁盘卷上存储阵列。 使用iSCSI SAN 的目的通常有以下两个：\n存储集成公司希望将不同的存储资源从分散在网络上的服务器移动到统一的位置（常常是数据中心）； 这可以让存储的分配变得更为有效。 SAN 环境中的服务器无需任何更改硬件或电缆连接就可以得到新分配的磁盘卷。\n灾难恢复公司希望把存储资源从一个数据中心镜像到另一个远程的数据中心上，后者在出现长时间停电的情况下可以用作热备份。 特别是，iSCSI SAN 使我们只需要用最小的配置更改就可以在 WAN 上面迁移整个磁盘阵列，实质上就是，把存储变成了“可路由的”，就像普通的网络通信一样。\n\n## 网络引导/启动\n\n从数据存储的角度，对于一个已经处于运行状态的计算机，任意类型的通用网络接口都可用于访问 iSCSI 设备。 然而，通用消费级网络接口却不能够从远程的 iSCSI 数据源引导无盘计算机。 相反，对于服务器而言，通常情况是，它是从一个小的本地 RAID 镜像或闪存驱动器引导设备来加载操作系统，并从本地设备启动完毕后，然后使用 iSCSI 来进行对数据存储的访问。\n对于配有支持网络引导的网络接口设备（网卡）的计算机，可以另外配置一台 DHCP 服务器来协助“iSCSI 启动”。 这种情况下，网卡会寻找一个提供PXE或BOOTP引导映像的 DHCP 服务器。该 DHCP 服务器会根据启动网卡的MAC地址提供对应的 iSCSI 启动目标设备/卷信息，然后计算机便可以开始从 iSCSI 远程启动的进程了。\n定制的 iSCSI 接口卡提供内置的 BIOS 功能，可以为该接口事先指定一个 iSCSI 目标设备，然后就可以直接从一个启动服务器进行启动，（而不需要另设一个DHCP 服务器）， 从而减少网络配置的复杂度。\n\n## 参看\n\n*

Interface）是一种用于计算机及其周边设备之间（硬盘、软驱、光驱、打印机、扫描仪等）系统级接口的独立处理器标准。SCSI标准定义命令、通讯协定以及实体的电气特性（换成OSI的说法，就是占据实体层、连结层、通讯层、应用层），最大部份的应用是在储存设备上（例如硬碟、磁带机），除外，SCSI可以连接的设备包括有扫描器、光学装置（像CD、DVD）、印表机等等，SCSI命令中有条列出支援的装置SCSI周边装置。理论上，SCSI不可能连接所有的装置，所以有“1Fh - unknown or no device type”这个参数存在。\n## SCSI-1\nSCSI-1是最初版本的SCSI，现已过时。SCSI-1具有8位BUS，数据传输率为40 Mbps(5MB/sec)。\n## SCSI-2\nSCSI-2是基于CCS的SCSI-1改进版本，由18条基本命令组成，可以运行在所有的硬体平台上。在Fast SCSI和Wide SCSI的支援下，SCSI-2在原SCSI-1的基础上传输速率得到了提高。命令序列特性使得SCSI设备能够以最有效的顺序执行命令。Fast SCSI的传输速率为10 MB/sec，当配合16位BUS时，其传输速率为20 MB/sec（Fast-Wide SCSI）。\n## SCSI-3\nSCSI-3是SCSI标准的首个平行界面标准，由Adaptec及SCSITA于1992年制定。SCSI-3在8-bit的线路亦可有20MB/s的速度，而在16-bit的环境亦可有40MB/s。不过，仪器的距离必须在3公尺（3M）以内。\nSCSI-3在SCSI-2基础上有了很多提高，如串列SCSI。通过6芯同轴电缆，其传输速率达到100 MB/sec。SCSI-3解决了旧SCSI版本中存在的终结和延迟问题。此外通过即插即用（plug-and-play）操作，自动分配SCSI ID和终结，使SCSI安装更为容易。与SCSI-2支援8台设备相比，SCSI-3能支援32台设备。\nSCSI-3改变了文档结构。它不是指用以处理所有不同层和电气介面（electrical interface）的单个文档，而是涵盖物理层、有关电介面基本协议、基本命令设置层（SPC）以及特殊协议层等的文档集合。例如，这个特定协议层文档包含块命令（SBC：Block Command） 中的硬盘介面命令、磁带设备的流命令（SSC）、RAID阵列的控制命令（SCC）、多媒体命令（MMC）、媒体切换命令（MCC：Media Changer Command）以及箱体服务命令（SES：enclosure services Command）。关于此SCSI-3中有一个全面的体系结构模型（SAM）。\n当今，SCSI-3单元采用Ultra-Wide和Ultra SCSI类型的驱动器。Ultra SCSI具有8位BUS，其传输速率为20 MB/sec。Ultra-Wide SCSI具有16位BUS，其传输速率达到40 MB/sec。\n## SAS\nSAS（Serial Attached SCSI，串列SCSI）是由并列SCSI物理存储介面演化而来，是由ANSI INCITS T10技术委员会开发的新的存储介面标准。与并列方式相比，串列方式提供更快速的通信传输速度以及更简易的配置。此外SAS支援与串列ATA设备相容，且两者可以使用相类似的电缆。SATA的硬碟可接在SAS的控制器使用，但SAS硬碟并不能接在SATA的控制器使用。\nSAS是点对点（point-to-point）连接，并允许多个端口集中于单个控制器上，可以建立在主机板（mother board）也可以另外添加。该技术建立在强大的并列SCSI通信技术基础上。SAS是采用SATA相容的电缆线采取点对点连接方式，从而在计算机系统中不需要建立菊花链（daisy-chaining）方式便可简单地实现线缆安装。"], "selected_questions": ["iSCSI常被认为是什么协议的低成本替代方法？",

{"name": "辛店文化", "documents": ["# 辛店文化\n\n古代文化\n\n1924年4月，甘肃考古的开拓者瑞典考古学家安特生及其助手从兰州出发沿洮河逆流而上，开始了甘肃境内的首次考古调查。他们发现的第一个古文化遗址就是位于洮河东岸的临洮县辛店遗址，随后，在此地及周围地区做了一系列的发掘和调查工作，在辛甸发掘了25座墓葬，清理了20座墓葬，在辛甸村以北的灰嘴岔遗址，也发现了同类遗物。\n\n其陶器大多为圜底，主体纹饰为双勾纹。安氏便以首次发现地命名。出土地本名为辛甸，但因翻译有误，正式出版物的中文译为辛店，之后按照约定俗成的原则再未更正，便一直称为辛店文化。## 分布\n\n由于分支类型较多，内涵较复杂。关于辛店文化的研究备受学术界关注。由于资料所限，初始阶段并未划分类型，安氏最初的研究成果认为：辛店文化源于马厂类型，但早于沙井文化。\n1947年裴文中先生在洮河、大夏河流域进行考古调查，发现辛店文化遗存9处。解放以后，为配合刘家峡水库建设工程，考古工作者跋山涉水，奋战数年，相继发现辛店遗址86处，发掘了永靖张家嘴、姬家川、莲花台等遗址，获得了一批重要资料，进而将辛店文化划分为张家嘴、姬家川两大类型。\n1956年，在东乡县唐汪川山神遗址发现一批以红色涡形纹为主的圜底罐有别于已知类型，暂称之为“唐汪式陶器”。\n\n1984年，甘肃省文物工作队与北京大学考古系合作发掘了临夏马路塬、甘谷毛家坪遗址，发现了以圜底、鼓腹、绳纹为特征的另一类辛店遗存，学术界以最早发现地青海民和山家头将其命名为山家头类型。\n经过众多学者数十年的努力，现已基本搞清辛店文化的发展序列和分布区域。最早的山家头类型彩陶较少，主要分布于黄河、洮河、湟水的交汇地带，向东可达渭河中上游，时间不晚于距今约3400年；第二阶段为姬家川类型，即典型的辛店遗存，彩陶比例增大，主要分布于洮河、湟水以及黄河沿岸，分布面偏西，时代约为距今3400年—3100年前后；第三阶段为张家嘴类遗存，包括唐汪式陶器，分布区域更为偏西，已达湟水中上游一带，彩陶纹饰更为多样化，时代约为距今3100年—2800年前后。整个辛店文化从商代一直延续到西周晚期。\n\n## 发展\n\n通过对比研究，学者们发现辛店文化早期遗存与齐家晚期遗存有十分明显的继承发展关系，同时，辛店彩陶也接受了不少马厂类型彩陶的文化因素。另外，辛店文化的某些特征也被沙井文化吸收。足见彩陶文化的融合与分化呈现出的十分复杂的局面。\n\n## 文化特征\n\n辛店文化是西北地区一支重要的文化遗存，其经济生活以畜牧业为主，兼营农业。铸铜业有较大的发展，器型有锥、矛、匕、凿和铜炮等。陶器以夹砂红褐陶为主，搀有石英砂、碎陶末、蚌壳末和云母片等搀和料。陶质粗糙、疏松，火候较低，器表多磨光，有的施红色或白色陶衣。器型以罐为主，有鬲、盆、杯、鼎、豆、盘等。彩陶的数量较多，彩与陶胎结合不紧密，易脱落。多圜状凹底器，主要器型有罐、盆、鬲、盘、钵、杯。纹饰别具一格，笔触粗犷，以双钩纹、S纹、太阳纹、三角纹为主，还有少量的动物纹——犬纹、羊纹、鹿纹、蜥蜴纹等，反映出了畜牧生活的特色。\n辛店文化的聚落遗址多位于河谷两岸的台地上。房屋形制较单一，多为长方形半地穴式建筑，门道设在西边，呈斜坡状，在居住面中间有一圆形灶。\n\n## 经济状况\n\n辛店文化的居民，经济生活是以农业为主的，但农业生产不如黄河中下游那样发达，畜牧业仍占比较重要的地位。这从各遗址发现的大量生产工具和动物遗骸可以得到证明。当时的工具以石器为主，常见的有斧、铲、刀、锛、杵、臼、研磨器和石磨盘等。其中石斧的种类较多，可分为梯式、长方形和带肩式几种；石铲形体较大，且刃部较宽；石刀呈长方形或椭圆形，在刃部两旁各打一小缺口，它与远古时期那种两侧带缺口的石刀有明显区别。\n骨制的生产工具也发现不少，主要是铲和凿，骨铲多用动物的肩胛骨或下颚骨制成，坚固耐用，刃部锋利，是一种既易制作又较实用的劳动效能很高的农业生产工具。石臼、杵和磨盘等在遗址中普遍发现，表明居民对粮食有了比较精细的加工，也是农业生产取得较大进展的反映。在农业经济的基础上，畜牧业发展很明显。牛、羊、狗、猪、马等都已被驯养，其中以羊的数量最多。遗址中还发现了许多鹿、鼠一类的动物骨骼，是狩猎的主要收获物。\n各部落的手工业生产已有较高水平，突出表现在制陶业的发展与青铜冶铸业的出现两个方面。青海湖以东、乐都以西的张家嘴部落，与东部洮河流域的姬家川部落陶器风格各有特点。张家嘴类型的陶器比较粗糙，全系手制，多采用泥条盘筑法，大量陶器掺杂碎陶末与石英砂粒烧制。陶器表面往往涂有一层白色、红色或紫红色陶衣，少数器物表面经过仔细打磨。除素面陶器外，纹饰常见彩绘、绳纹、划纹、附加堆纹等。彩陶图案中由三条线绘制的有羊角双勾纹的陶罐是这种文化类型的陶器中最具代表性的花纹，此外还有一些动物图案，如象生的犬形纹等。器形以平底器为主，其次是圈足器和三足器，主要器物有盘、钵、盆、杯、碟、罐、瓮、甑、鬲、鼎等十多种。\n作为同一种文化，姬家川类型的陶器与张家嘴类型有许多共同特点，但区别在于除素面陶器外，绳纹较多，且纹饰细密，排列有序，有些陶器在拍印的绳纹上描绘彩色花纹，别具一格，是制陶工艺上一个独特的创造。彩绘陶器大多颜色斑斓，层次分明，不同的花纹图案与器物的不同部位相配合，并有一定的规律，十分引人注目。陶器的另一个特点是凹底器较多，其次为三足器与圜底器，而平底器与圈足器较少，与张家嘴类型有明显区别。\n辛店文化的冶铜工艺水平已远超过青铜文化初期的齐家文化。铜制品已不限于小型的工具，而且当地已能铸造青铜容器了。例如张家嘴除发现铜锥、铜矛外，还有铜容器的口沿残片出土。这个遗址也发现了炼铜炉的炉衬残块，在炉衬外沿还挂着一层铜渣。至于小型铜器，则在各遗址有普遍发现，其中包括锥、刀、匕、扣、铃、泡、珠、削、凿等。\n\n制骨业和玉石器加工技术都比较进步。骨器除制造出生产工具外，还发现了雕刻出 4—8 齿的骨梳与雕花的骨牌。许多墓葬都随葬着装饰品，如玛瑙珠、绿松石饰、骨管和小铜泡等，工艺水平都很高。\n\n## 墓葬\n\n辛店文化的墓葬，形制主要是长方形竖穴土坑墓，还有长方形竖穴偏洞墓和近似椭圆形或三角形的不规则形墓。葬式多样，有仰身直肢葬、屈肢葬、侧身直肢葬、俯身葬、二次葬等。随葬品以陶器为主，还有铜器、装饰品等。辛店文化还流行随葬动物的习俗，有牛、羊等，但不是完整地随葬，而是动物躯体的某一部分，摆放在人的头部上方。辛店文化还发现有殉葬墓，这种现象说明辛店文化已进入奴隶社会。", "## 辛店文化\n辛店文化是中国甘肃省和青海省所发现的青铜器时代文化，时间大约在西元前1000年到前1300年左右，约相当于中原地区的商周时期。为瑞典考古学家安特生于1924年所发现，原来发掘地名为甘肃临洮辛甸，但因译作西名再转译时发生错误，为辛店，后约定俗成称为辛店文化。\n除了辛甸遗址之外，永靖县张家嘴遗址的发现，因同时有二者的遗迹地层，因此确认了齐家文化的发展在辛店文化之前，此外在青海省湟水流域的乐都一带亦有不少遗址。\n辛店文化的特色是已经开始使用青铜器，为甘、青地区进入青铜器时代之始，除了铜器之外，仍有许多石器以及从大量墓葬中发掘出的大量陶器。生活主要以畜牧为主，农业为辅。"],

{"name": "福特基金会", "documents": ["## 福特基金会\n福特基金会（Ford Foundation）是以美国纽约为总部，致力于人类福利促进发展的私人基金会。基金会由Edsel Ford和亨利·福特于1936年创建，最初是用Edsel Ford捐赠的25000美元启动运行的。到1947年两位创始人已不在人世之时，基金会持有福特汽车公司90%的无表决权股份（福特家族保留了有表决权股份）。1955年至1974年间，基金会出售了其持有的福特汽车公司股份，因而如今不再在汽车公司内发挥作用。\n基金会通过总部和十个国际办事处来审批预算。2014财年，它通报的资产为124亿美元，批准了5.079亿美元的拨款。\n## 历史\n基金会于1936年1月15日由福特汽车公司总裁埃德塞尔·福特和其他两名高管在密歇根州成立，以“获取和管理资金，用于对大众福祉有益的科学、教育与慈善目的”。在其早期，福特基金会在密歇根州福特家庭成员和他们的同事的领导下运行，基金会支持亨利福特医院、亨利福特博物馆和格林菲尔德村，以及其他组织。\n1943年埃德塞尔·福特去世后，埃塞尔的长子亨利福特二世继任基金会主席。基金会很快就成为了世界上最大的慈善事业。此后董事会委托Gaither Study Committee为基金会的未来发展绘制蓝图。委员会在加州律师 H. Rowan Gaither的领导下，建议基金会向国际慈善事业转型，并致力于促进人类福利发展，“敦促基金会关注解决人类所面临的最紧迫的问题，无论他们可能是什么，而不是在任何特定领域工作……。”董事会于1949年接受了建议。\n董事会决定多元化基金会的投资组合，并在1955年至1974年期间逐渐卖出自己的大量福特汽车公司股票。这种剥离让福特汽车成为一家上市公司。\n2012年，该基金会宣称，它不是一个研究图书馆，并将其档案从纽约市转移到纽约州Sleepy Hollow的洛克菲勒档案中心。\n### 主要赠款和举措\n根据Gaither Study Committee所提出的，并在1949年被基金会的董事会所接受的建议，基金会扩大了其资助范围，包括支持高等教育、艺术、经济发展、公民权利和环境等领域。\n1951年，基金会首次拨款支持公共广播系统的发展，后来被称为国家教育电视（NET），于1952年启播。 这些补助继续，在1969年，基金会向儿童电视讲习班捐款100万美元，以帮助创建和开播《芝麻街》。 公共广播公司于1970年10月5日以公共电视网取代国家教育电视。\n该基金会的首个国际外地办事处于1952年在印度新德里开幕。\n整个20世纪50年代，基金会提供了艺术和人文奖学金，支持像约瑟夫·亚伯斯、詹姆斯·鲍德温、索尔·贝洛、Herbert Blau、E·E·卡明斯、弗兰纳里·奥康纳、Jacob Lawrence、Maurice Valency、Robert Lowell和玛格丽特·米德等人的工作。1961年，科菲·安南从基金会获得教育补助金，在明尼苏达州圣保罗的Macalester学院完成学业。\n在其“剧本计划”，该基金会帮助支持在专业地区剧院的作家，如旧金山的 Actor's Workshop 并提供类似的帮助给休斯顿的 Alley Theatre 和华盛顿的 Arena Stage。\n1968年，基金会开始发放1200万美元，说服法学院将“法学院诊所”作为其课程的一部分。诊所旨在提供法律实践的实践经验，同时为穷人提供志愿法律服务。然而，许多人指责诊所被教授用来参与政治活动。有评论家认为基金会的财政投入是转折点，使这些诊所从传授实践经验转变为参与倡导左翼观点。\n在1967年和1968年，该基金会为纽约市公立学校的权力下放和社区控制提供了资金支持。海洋山－布朗斯维尔的分权化导致一些白人教师和行政人员被解雇，这激起了由联合教师联合会领导的全市教师罢工。\n在1960年代末开始，持续到1970年代，该基金会扩展到民事权利诉讼，向民权诉讼团体提供了1800万美元。墨西哥美国法律辩护和教育基金于1967年成立，基金会拨款220万美元。同年，该基金会还资助了拉扎兹全国理事会的前身拉扎兹西南理事会的成立。1972年，基金会向美洲土著人权利基金提供了为期三年的120万美元赠款。date=2016年3月1976年，该基金会帮助推出了格拉米银行，向孟加拉国的农村穷人提供小额贷款。格拉米银行及其创始人穆罕默德·尤努斯在2006年获得诺贝尔和平奖，以表彰他们为开拓小额信贷领域而做出的贡献。\n1987年，该基金会开始拨款资助艾滋病疫情，截止2010年的此项捐赠款总额为29,512,312美元。\n1994年，美国作家和前哲学教授克里斯蒂娜·霍夫·索默斯（Christina Hoff Sommers）指控福特基金会资助了“性别女性主义”——一种放弃了女权主义对性别平等的追求，赞成对男性性别战争的意识形态。西班牙法官弗朗西斯科·塞拉诺·卡斯特罗在他2012年的书《性别的独裁统治》中发表了类似的声明。\n2001年，基金会启动了其有史以来最大的、赠款总额为2.8亿美元为期12年的国际奖学金计划(IFP)。目前 IFP正在进入它的最后阶段。最终队列已经被选定，而这个项目也将在2013年结束。研究金学员代表了来自美国以外的历史上处于不利地位的群体。IFP已经成就了将近4,350名青年领袖。其中超过80%的人已经完成了他们的学业，现在正在为他们的家乡服务。\n2003年，犹太电讯社以及其他一些美国新闻服务机构，批评该基金会支持了在2001年反对种族主义世界会议上被指控宣扬反犹太主义的巴勒斯坦非政府组织。在以众议员杰罗尔德·纳德勒为首的数个国会议员的压力下，该基金会做出了道歉，然后禁止了在它的受资助者中倡导“暴力、恐怖主义、偏见或对任何国家的破坏”的做法。这一举动本身引发了大学教务长和各种非营利团体之间在言论自由问题上的抗议。\n该基金会与新的以色列基金的伙伴关系经常受到批评，原因就在于他们的受赞助者大多都是秉持自由主义理念的个人和事业团体。这种批评在2001年德班会议之后出现，在会上一些受该基金会资助的非政府组织支持了将以色列的政策与种族隔离制度等同起来、反对那些旨在取消以色列合法地位的团体等的一系列决议。作为回应，基金会通过了更严格资金标准。\n2005年，密歇根州总检察长麦克·克斯发起了一场对基金会的调查，却最终适得其反。虽然该基金会总部设在纽约市，但它在 密歇根拥有特许权，相应的也就在该州部分管辖权治下。Cox专注于基金会的管理、董事会成员之间的潜在利益冲突、以及他所认为的基金会在该州慈善事业中的乏善可陈。在1998年至2002年期间，该基金为密歇根州慈善机构每年捐助了约250万美元，远远低于许多其他慈善机构的捐赠规模。而该基金会则反驳说，盖瑟研究委员会在1949年广泛审查和报告建议基金会将业务范围拓展到密歇根以外的国内及国际赠款。基金会的董事会批准了该报告，并随后投票决定在1953年把该基金迁至了纽约市。\n多年来，基金会一直在基金会中心所编制的美国基金会资产与捐赠额年度排名中位列榜首；然而，近年来该基金会已经在榜单中下降了数个排位，尤其是比尔及梅琳达·盖茨基金会在2000年成立后。截至2013年5月4日，基金会在资产方面排名第二，在年度赠款方面排名第十。\n在2011年，基金会宣布它将于2013年停止资助在以色列的项目。自2003年起，它通过新以色列基金向以色列的非政府组织提供4000万美元，用于推进公民权利和人权，帮助阿拉伯裔以色列公民获得平等和促进以色列-巴勒斯坦的和平。来自福特基金会的拨款占新以色列基金每年1500万美元捐赠人指导捐款的大约三分之一。\n### 与美国的关系\n该基金会被指责由美国政府资助。 约翰·J·麦克洛伊，基金会的主席从1958-1965，故意雇用众多的代理，并根据的前提是一个关系与美国中央情报局是不可避免的，设立了一个三人委员会负责处理其要求。p=141", "福特基金会成立于1936年，由福特汽车公司的亨利·福特及其子埃德塞尔·福特拿出部分股票和资产作为基金建立。1950年基金会与福特汽车分开，在一个独立理事会的管理下运作，从此再没有接受任何捐助，基金会的资金全部来源于原有基金在股票、国债、房地产等各方面的投资所得。\n\n## 简介\n\n美国最大的私人基金会之一，主要资助四个领域：司法体系改革、生殖健康、环境和发展、公共政策研究。\n加强民间组织建设\n通过技术援助、研究、交流与沟通以及能力建设，帮助中国民间组织的健康发展，资助规制性基本框架的建设及体系的建设；\n农村社区自然资源管理使用\n资助政府部门、研究人员和民间团体在中国西部山区和草原进行开发、实施、宣传可持续及参与性的自然资源管理战略；\n改革中等教育\n帮助学校提高弱势群体学生的入学机会、改善教育公平，特别是西部贫困农村和少数民族学生；\n促进高等教育入学及毕业\n资助有创新能力的个人和机构通过建立新的机制，增加农村社区、妇女和少数民族等弱势群体获得优质高等教育的机会；\n性与生殖健康教育\n资助正式和非正式教育体系中促进性与生殖健康教育的机构和项目；\n民事与刑事司法制度改革\n运用创新性和科学性的研究方法资助中国政府机构和非政府组织；\n促进透明、有效和有问责性的政府\n资助政府机构、研究机构和民间组织开展项目，帮助各级政府增加透明度、提高效率和建立问责机制；\n\n## 大事记\n\n1960-1970年，与美国的自由事业联系起来，广泛资助民权和环保活动组织、维护公共利益的律师和公共广播网；\n1979年，应中国政府邀请来华开展工作，通过促进在社会科学领域的国际合作；\n1980-1990年，支持美国的多所大学的中国研究项目，其后，又支持中国的若干所大学培养经济学和法学的教师队伍；\n1988年，福特基金会北京办事处正式成立；\n\n## 资助项目\n\n90年代参与长江中、上游防护林工程，在福特基金会的帮助下，云南和四川省的林学家和社会学家已经参与帮助林业部门寻求解决途径，提高山区人民的生活水平。在这两个省，乡村林业项目正在与长江中、上游防护林工程的实施结合进行。\n1998年到2001年基金会资助30.76万元，在云南生育健康研究会指导下，由云南省罗平县妇联实施妇女健康与小额信贷项目。\n2004年6月，福特基金会援助15万美元，云南省教育厅和福特基金会在楚雄市，南华县，澜沧县，普洱县的20所小学实施了勤工俭学助学项目。\n2008年福特基金会在西部高校开展了“提高高校贫困生能力”（Pathways to Higher Education，简称PHE）的项目，已完成第二期，涉及西部八省区的18所高校。将原先的单纯扶贫项目转变为切实提高学生的创新能力，收到了多方面的效果，不仅提高了贫困生的素质，也促进了高校教育教学制度的创新。"], "selected_questions": ["福特基金会与哪个基金组织的伙伴关系受到了批评？原因是什么？",

proteins（PBP）结合，抑制组成细菌细胞壁的肽聚糖合成，达到抑制细菌合成细胞壁的目的。\n##药物代谢\n双氯西林主要以未代谢的形式经肾通过尿液排出，在人体内的半衰期大约是20-30分钟。\n##临床\n双氯西林主要用于治疗由革兰氏阳性菌感染引发的疾病，使用前需要通过耐药性试验验证细菌有无双氯西林抗药性。\n虽然双氯西林是作为一种耐酶青霉素开发的，它也很难被β-内酰胺酶（青霉素酶）分解，但目前还是发现了对双氯西林具有抗性的耐药菌菌株。", "# 双氯西林\n\nβ内酰胺类抗生素\n\n双氯西林属β内酰胺类抗生素，双氯西林具耐酸、耐酶等特点，对葡萄球菌和革兰阳性菌具抗菌活性。研究表明，阿莫西林—双氯西林对常见的病原菌具良好抗菌作用，对伤寒沙门菌也具有良好抗菌作用，可作为治疗呼吸道感染、单纯性皮肤软组织感染和伤寒等的首选药物之一。## 基本信息\n\n双氯西林(双氯青霉素)

本品为半合成青霉素，抗菌谱与氯苯唑青霉素相似，其血浓度和血清蛋白结合率较高。主要用于对青霉素耐药的葡萄球菌感染，包括败血症、心内膜炎、骨髓炎、呼吸道感染及创面感染等。\n【剂量与用法】 口服，成人，0.25g～0.5g/次，4～6次/日；儿童，每日30mg～60mg/kg，分4次。\n\n## 产品说明\n\n成分：本品为复方制剂，其组份为为阿莫西林0.25g和双氯西林0.125g。\n性状：本品为薄膜衣片，除去包衣后显白色或类白色。规格：0.375g（阿莫西林0.25g，双氯西林0.125g）\n贮藏：密闭，在凉暗干燥处保存。\n包装：双铝包装，12片/盒，24片/盒。\n有效期：暂定24个月\n孕妇及哺乳期妇女用药：阿莫西林和双氯西林能穿过胎盘，并可在乳汁中分泌。在怀孕期间用本品治疗感染的安全性尚未建立，但目前未见有害性的报道。用本品治疗须衡量对母亲和婴儿的潜在危险，哺乳期妇女慎用。\n儿童用药：新生儿和幼儿肾功能发育不健全，使用本品应监测血药浓度，必要时进行剂量调整。\n老年用药：老年患者应根据肾功能情况调整用药剂量或时间。\n\n## 注意事项\n\n1、本品为青霉素类药物，使用本品治疗可能会出现严重甚至致命的过敏反应。治疗前需详细询问病人的过敏史。治疗时若出现过敏反应，应停止用药，并采取适当治疗措施。严重过敏反应需紧急处理，如使用肾上腺素、吸氧、静注皮质类固醇及使用导气管等。 2、对头孢类药物有过敏史患者慎用。\n3、已有报告在使用所有种类青霉素（包括阿莫西林和双氯西林钠）的患者中发生伪膜性肠炎，严重程度为中度至重度。在使用青霉素患者发生腹泻时需考虑伪膜性肠炎的可能。\n4、治疗期间应注意可能发生的霉菌或细菌病原体的重复感染。若出现重复感染（通常为肠杆菌、念球菌或假单孢菌感染），应停止用药并适当治疗。\n5、尽管青霉素类毒性很低，但长期治疗时建议进行肾、肝和造血肝功能评价。若肾功能降低，应根据降低程度减少剂量。肝功能异常病人慎用本品。\n6、传染性单核多细胞增多症患者使用本品，班丘疹发生率增加，应避免使用本品。\n\n## 药理毒理\n\n双氯西林为广谱青霉素类抗生素，双氯西林为异恶唑青霉素，后者不易被青霉素酶破坏。本品体外对下列细菌有抗菌作用。革兰氏阳性菌：金黄色葡萄球菌、A组和B组溶血性链球菌、草绿色链球菌、粪链球菌、肺炎球菌等。革兰氏阴性菌：淋病奈瑟氏菌、脑膜炎双球菌、流感和副流感嗜血杆菌、大肠杆菌、奇异变形杆菌、沙门氏菌属细菌等。厌氧菌：梭状芽胞杆菌属、放线菌属细菌等。\n\n## 药代动力学\n\n双氯西林在胃酸条件下稳定，口服吸收良好。食物对阿莫西林的吸收无任何影响，但能减少双氯西林的吸收。口服1~2小时内血药浓度均可达到高峰值，半衰期为0.5-1.5小时。阿莫西林的蛋白结合率较低，约为20%；而双氯西林的蛋白结合率可达97%以上。两者可广泛分布于组织和体液中，但极少进入脑脊液。两者体内代谢有限，原形药物和代谢物均通过肾小球过滤和肾小管分泌方式在尿中排泄，尿中排泄占口服剂量的60%，少量通过粪便和胆汁排泄。\n\n## 药物相互作用\n\n1、丙磺舒、阿司匹林、吲哚美辛、保泰松、磺胺药可减少本品在肾小管的排泄，因而使本品的血药浓度升高，血消除半衰期（t1/2β）延长，毒性也可能增加。\n2、本品与别嘌醇合用时，皮疹发生率显著增高，故应避免合用。\n3、本品不宜与双硫仑等乙醛脱氢酶抑制药合用。\n4、本品与氯霉素合用于细菌性脑膜炎时，远期后遗症的发生率较两者单用时高。\n5、氯霉素、红霉素、四环素类等抗生素和磺胺药等抑菌药可干扰本品的杀菌活性，因此不宜与本品合用，尤其在治疗脑膜炎或急需杀菌药的严重感染时。\n\n## 不良反应\n\n口服可引起胃肠道反应：恶心、呕吐、食欲不振、腹胀、腹泻、青霉素过敏者忌用，个别病例可致白细胞减少，皮疹、药热、头痛、心悸，大剂量可有神经系统反应，如神志不清、抽搐、惊厥。\n1、以皮疹最常见的过敏反应；口服可引起轻度恶心、呕吐、腹泻等胃肠道反应；大剂量使用（每日200mg/kg）时可出现肾脏毒性等。\n2、多见过敏反应：斑丘疹（尤其易发生于传染性单核细胞增多症、巨细胞病毒感染、淋巴细胞白血病、淋巴瘤患者）、荨麻疹及其他血清病样反应、喉水肿、药物热和嗜酸粒细胞增多等。\n3、二重感染：长期或大量应用本品可致耐青霉素金黄色葡萄球菌、革兰阴性杆菌或白念珠菌感染（舌苔呈棕色甚至黑色）。\n4、少见粒细胞和血小板减少、一过性血清氨基转移酶升高、剥脱性皮炎、过敏性休克、神经毒性和肾毒性等。\n\n## 检测\n\nHPLC法测定阿莫西林双氯西林钠胶囊含量 目的：建立阿莫西林双氯西林钠胶囊中阿莫西林和双氯西林钠的含量测定方法。\n方法：采用ShimadzuVP ODS色谱柱，流动相为0.008mol/L十二烷基硫酸钠（用磷酸调节至pH4.5），甲醇（体积比68∶32），检测波长225nm。\n结果：阿莫西林和双氯西林在该色谱条件下均有合适的保留，测定可在10min内完成。阿莫西林在0.0050～1.0000mg/mL，双氯西林在0.0025～0.5036mg/mL质量浓度范围内与峰面积呈良好的线性关系。阿莫西林和双氯西林钠平均回收率（n=9）分别为99.4%（RSD=1.0%）和99.1%（RSD=0.97%）。\n结论：该方法准确、重复性好、灵敏度高，可用于该产品的质量控制。\n\n##

历史沿革\n\n### 建党初期\n\n1921年10月10日，中国共产党湖南支部成立，这是中国共产党成立后的第一个省级党支部，毛泽东任书记，委员有何叔衡、易礼容等。由于党员人数不断增加，1922年5月，中共湖南支部改组为中共湘区执行委员会，毛泽东任书记；1925年毛泽东调中央工作后，书记一职由李维汉接任。1925年11月，中共湘区执行委员会改称中共湖南区执行委员会，1927年5月正式改称中共湖南省委员会。\n\n### 抗战时期\n\n1938年1月16日，中共湖南省工委在长沙秘密建立，高文华任书记。从此，处于地下状态的省工委和公开的八路军驻湘通讯处相互配合，使党在全省开展抗日救亡活动及恢复发展各级党组织的工作进入到一个新阶段。\n\n1938年7月上旬，中共中央长江局决定中共湖南省工委改称中共湖南省委，高文华为省委书记。根据中共中央“猛烈发展党组织”的指示，湖南省委集中力量发展党员、建立党的各级领导机关。到10月，全省共建立17个县委、10个县工委、5个特区委（特支或总支），党员猛增至3000余人。\n1938年11月“文夕大火”后，中共湖南省委与八路军驻湘通讯处等机构一同搬迁至邵阳，继续动员和领导民众投入抗日救亡运动。1939年2月，中共湖南省委在邵阳八路军驻湘通讯处召开第一次扩大会议，选举高文华为省委书记。同年4月上旬，省委在邵阳召开第二次扩大会议，研究如何进行紧急战争动员，巩固扩大统一战线，大力发展党组织等。\n为避免遭到敌人的迫害，抗战时期，省委机关不得不频繁搬迁。1939年12月搬迁至衡阳。1940年2月搬迁至湘潭。同年12月底再移至湘乡县永丰镇（今双峰县城）。在十分艰苦的条件下，中共湖南省委有力地领导了全省抗日救亡运动。\n(史料支持：省委党史研究室编撰：夏远生)\n成立会址\n抗战时期的中共湖南省委是在当年邵阳市郊一幢名为“曾家院子”的普通民房里正式成立。\n\n“曾家院子”位于邵阳市双清区昭陵西路188号。因四周被围墙或高层建筑包围，俨然如一个四合院。房子不大，两层小楼，砖木结构。\n推开院门，跃入“红色追寻”记者眼帘的是：青砖，黑瓦，老地板；灶台，桌椅，旧床铺……当年的原物，向记者无声地述说着抗战时期，中共湖南省委艰苦卓绝的光辉历史。\n“曾家院子”，当时公开挂牌为“八路军驻湘通讯处”。1938年11月至1939年12月，在八路军驻湘通讯处掩护下，中共湖南省委以此为据点，深入开展抗日救亡运动，在全省建立最广泛的抗日民族统一战线。邵阳，一度成为全省抗日救亡运动的中心。\n“曾家院子”正门墙壁上，镌刻着时任省委书记高文华题写的一行遒劲大字：“中共湖南省委成立会议会址”。\n“曾家院子”二楼的这个不起眼的小会议室，还成了抗战时期全省革命干部培训的基地。\n\n### 建国以后\n\n1、1949年8月－1952年9月\n\n1949年8月20日，经中共中央批准，原中共湖南省工委与随军南下的中共湖南省委合并，组成新的中共湖南省委员会。\n书 记 黄克诚\n副书记 王首道 金明 高文华\n常 委 黄克诚 王首道 金明 高文华 萧劲光

{"name": "克林顿基金会", "documents": ["## 克林顿基金会\n克林顿基金会（成立于1997年，作为威廉·克林顿基金会，2，并于2013年开始称为比尔、希拉里和切尔西・克林顿基金会3）是一个非营利性公司，根据第501（c）美国税码。它是由美国比尔·克林顿前总统设立的，其任务是“加强美国人民和全世界人民应付全球相互依存挑战的能力”。4其办事处设在纽约、小岩城和阿肯色。\n## 历史\n到2016年，该基金会从美国公司，外国政府和公司，政治捐助者和其他各种团体和个人筹集了大约20亿美元。接受来自富有捐助者的资金一直是引起争议的根源。该基金会“赢得了慈善专家的赞誉，并已获得了两党支持”。\n慈善捐款不是克林顿基金会的主要重点，而是将大部分资金留在基金会，雇用工作人员执行自己的人道主义方案。在对基金会的财务记录和税务报表进行习惯性审查之后，慈善监督组织（Charity Navigator）给予基金会最高的评级，四分之四的评级。8不同的慈善机构，慈善观察（CharityWatch）说基金会的88％的资金用于其慈善使命，并给基金在2016年的A评级。在2015年，基于收入2.23亿美元和费用比率为12％的2 600余万美元以完成其任务。\n这个基金会是一个公共组织，任何人都可以捐赠，并且与克林顿家庭基金会不同，后者是个人克林顿家族慈善事业的私人组织。\n比尔・克林顿，他的女儿切尔西·克林顿（两个董事会成员），没有从基金会收到任何工资或从基金会收到任何收入。当希拉里・克林顿是一个董事会成员时，她也没有收到基金会的任何收入。\n## 结构\n### 克林顿全球倡议\n克林顿全球倡议是第42任美国总统比尔·克林顿是在2005年发起这项全球倡议，旨在制造机会让国际领导人会面，并推行解决世界所面临的紧迫问题的创新方案，也是目前最受欢迎的慈善组织之一。\n自2005年以来，参加这项倡议的成员已承诺拨出460亿美元，以落实改善人民生活的各种计划，从而让150国的2000多万人受惠。在2008年常年会议上所承诺落实的计划，预计也将惠及1亿6000万人。2008年12月克林顿全球论坛（Clinton Global Initiative）在香港召开，这也是克林顿全球倡议首次在美国纽约以外的城市召开。\n2017年1月16日，英国《每日邮报》报道克林顿全球倡议辞退了最后22名员工，作为即将关闭该计划的一部分。\n## 争议\n### 基金会支出比例\n在2018年12月13日美国国会众议院监督和政府改革委员会举办的听证会上，投资顾问公司DM Income Advisors的创办人多伊尔（Lawrence Doyle）和莫伊尼汉（John Moynihan）对克林顿基金会进行了两年的调查，查看基金会的纳税申报表及其它公开数据、并采访基金会员工。在将基金会获得的慈善捐赠跟旅行、工资和行政支出等费用去比对后，他们发现了一些不对劲的地方，克林顿基金会有六成左右的收入用在发放员工薪水、旅行和补助上，通常一个好的慈善机构只会在这些事情上花费15%左右。并于2017年8月首次向犹他州奥格登的国税局办公室提交对克林顿基金会的投诉。\n### 逃税争议\n多伊尔和莫伊尼汉更指出，克林顿基金会按照外国代理人行事，这不符合国税局对非营利机构的界定。他们告诉国会，克林顿基金会在作为外国代理人运营初期以及存在期间没有按照501c3慈善基金会的要求运作，所以它不应当享有非营利组织的免税资格。「连基金会和它自己的审计师在正式提交的文件中都承认，它确实作为（外国）代理人运作，所以该基金会无权获得IRS 170（c）2中概述的501c3免税特权。」莫伊尼汉说，「也因为如此，该基金会应该根据《外国代理注册法》（FARA）登记。」多伊尔和莫伊尼汉是资深的法务调查员，既通晓法律，亦精通金融。他们表示，克林顿基金会借用非盈利机构名义获得免税、涉嫌逃税的预估金额在4亿美元到25亿美元之间；同时，若美国国税局发现克林顿基金会不是慈善机构，那么捐助者也可能要对捐款所欠税款负责。\n### 捐款及利益冲突\n在奥巴马政府当政期间希拉里受到质疑在批准一宗跟俄罗斯公司(铀壹公司 Uranium One)的铀协议过程中有利益冲突，批准铀协议的外国投资委员会（CFIUS）而时任国务卿希拉里是这个委员会的成员。前总统克林顿在2010年6月举行演讲，克林顿基金会因此从一家俄罗斯投资银行获得50万美元捐款，知情人形容这家公司是俄罗斯政府的延伸机构。在演讲的同期，铀壹公司和Rosatom告诉CFIUS，俄罗斯政府打算收购20%的美国铀容量。由于俄罗斯政府因而接管了美国铀资产的很大一部分，此项交易被质疑对美国国家安全造成损害。\n克林顿基金会自创立以来，吸金功力惊人，已经接近20亿美元。由于外国捐款的规模，包括许多国家政府的捐款，外界日益担心这些捐款意在影响美国最有权势的夫妇，并以此获得政治及经济上的利益。希拉里指自己会在当选总统后退出克林顿基金会。\n### 希拉里邮件门\n在2016年，由希拉里高级助手发出的一些内部邮件落到了骇客手中，内容为有关「克林顿基金会收到的外国捐赠及克林顿个人的营利性项目可能对希拉里的政治前途产生影响」，最终由维基解密分批发放公众。从邮件中可看出，为尽量降低基金会出现潜在冲突的可能性而采取的举措，助手们以及希拉里和克林顿的家邮件人中间引发了权力纷争和内斗。同时这些邮件内容令人担心基金会的捐助者是否获取了希拉里领导下国务院的特殊渠道安排或其他回报。", "# 克林顿基金会\n\n第42任美国总统任期结束时候建立的基金会\n\n克林顿基金会是克林顿在作为第42任美国的总统第二任期结束的时候建立的基金会。从那时起基金会已经变为一全球性非政府的组织,在全世界有超过800个有工作人员和志愿者。他们的办事处设在哈莱姆区、纽约市、波士顿、马萨诸塞州和阿肯色州的小石城。## 主要职责\n\n加强美国以及全世界人民面对全球性挑战互相依赖的能力。\n\n## 建设宗旨\n\n1、收取克林顿担任总统期间权力使用的回报；\n2、为克林顿家族后裔提供一份稳定的收入；\n\n## 业务范围\n\n健康安全;经济权力;领导能力发展和公民服务;种族、民族和宗教的和解。\n\n## 组织机构\n\n办事处\n克林顿基金会艾滋病行动组织（CHAI）是由美国前总统克林顿先生在卸任后，于2002年在美国建立的。该组织的行动主要关注于发展中国家的艾滋病的治疗与关怀，因为只有将预防与关怀治疗结合起来，才可能遏制全球艾滋病疫情快速蔓延的势头。\nCHAI在中国的任务是为艾滋病病人提供一个范围广的、高质量的、综合的和结合关爱与治疗的服务。2004年4月29日，CHAI同中国卫生部签署了谅解备忘录，是第一个与中国卫生部签署谅解备忘录的非政府组织。\n在中国政府与克林顿基金会总体的合作框架之下，克林顿基金会认为其成功即：通过支持我们的合作伙伴，将给艾滋病感染者和患者提供的优质医疗服务最大化。\n\n##

涉嫌敛财\n\n2015年5月，克林顿基金会被指卷入了国际足联贪腐案，被揭发曾接受FIFA一笔多达10万美元的直接捐款，但用途不明。\n\n2016年7月，美国国税局在一封信中证实，正在对克林顿基金会“付费服务”（pay-to-play）的违法敛财活动进行调查。这项调查缘起于64名共和党议员向IRS、FBI和FTC递交举报信。举报信要求对这个由家族基金会潜在的“违法敛财行为”进行调查，并特别提到Laureate教育公司，Uranium One矿业公司和克林顿基金会之间的利益关联，以及基金会违反了作为“免税组织”的相关规定。\n共和党议员的举报信件主要集中在三个未解决的争议，这些问题在施伟泽(Peter Schweizer)2015年的新书《克林顿摇钱树》（“Clinton Cash”）和纽约时报的报道中曾提到，包括涉及到与基金会原始备案501（C）（3）档案的矛盾，交易一家名为Uranium One的公司，以及克林顿基金与Laureate国际大学之间的关系，Laureate是一家盈利性质的教育集团。\nLaureate教育集团在28个国家开办盈利性大学。该公司授予比尔克林顿荣誉董事职位，薪酬1650万美元；同时该公司向克林顿基金会经常性捐赠100-500万美元。\n在克林顿收取Laureate薪酬时， 希拉里担任国务卿。 这个期间，世界银行下属国际金融公司IFC向 Laureate投资1.5亿美元。此为IFC历史上最大的此类单项投资。问题是，美国政府是IFC的最大金主，其投资是美国政府掌控的。\n与此同时，美国国际开发署向国际青年基金IYF拨款5500万美元。而Laureate的CEO Douglas Becker是IYF的董事会成员。克林顿基金和Laureate共同参与IYF的项目。\n另外，IFC也向克林顿的朋友Frank Giustra的一家公司投资1.5亿美元，而Frank Giustra则向克林顿基金捐献一亿美元成立Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership项目。\nFrank Giustra拥有的另一家Uranium One采矿公司，Giustra打算将其哈萨克斯坦铀矿业务卖给俄国原子能机构，但此交易需美国政府批准。而当时正是希拉里担任国务卿时期，该交易最终获得了批准。\n所以，有分析人士认为， 希拉里的一些邮件只用私人邮件系统，根本不用公家的邮件系统，绝对不是一般的荒疏\n。\n\n### 受贿丑闻\n\n2016年11月4日，克林顿基金会承认，美国民主党总统候选人希拉里·克林顿于国务卿任内时，基金会收了卡塔尔100万美元，而未向国务院通报。\n希拉里·克林顿曾经承诺，将让国务院审核来自外国政府的新捐款。\n希拉里·克林顿阵营竞选总干事波德斯达数千封电邮遭黑，据“维基解密”上月所公开的内容显示，卡塔尔官员2011年允诺向克林顿基金会捐款100万美元，做为希拉里丈夫、美国前总统克林顿65岁生日礼，并寻求来年与克林顿私下会面，面交支票。\n希拉里·克林顿于2009年为了出任国务卿，曾签下道德同意书，规范其家族的全球性基金会。当时她允诺当外国政府准备“实质增加”捐献时，基金会将向国务院通报，以供监督。道德同意书的设计用意，是为防止美国外交政策受到有钱的捐献者所影响。\n克林顿基金会发言人柯克斯特拉本周证实基金会接受了卡塔尔这笔100万美元的贺礼，但声称这并未使卡塔尔对基金会的捐献“有实质上增加”。柯克斯特拉拒绝证实，卡塔尔官员事后有无如愿见到克林顿。\n包括华府的卡塔尔大使馆官员，以及在卡塔尔首都多哈的官员，也都拒绝讨论这笔捐款。"],

{"name": "语丝社", "documents": ["1924年11月成立于北京的文学社团，因创办《语丝》周刊而得名。主要成员有鲁迅、周作人、孙伏园、川岛、钱玄同、林语堂等。该社并无明确的目标，但他们要“催促新的产生，对于有害于新的旧物，则竭力加以排击”，“提倡自由思想，独立判断”。他们从事社会文化批评，所写杂文和散文形成一种具有泼辣幽默的“语丝文体”，因而被人们称为“语丝派”。他们在反对封建复古逆流，反对封建军阀政府镇压北京女师大学潮、制造“三一八”惨案的斗争中曾起过积极的作用。但该社内部的立场、思想倾向各有不同。周作人、林语堂等主张所谓的“费厄泼赖”，散布“以宽大为怀，不念旧恶”的论调，而鲁迅等人则旗帜鲜明地提出要“痛打落水狗”。1930年3月《语丝》停刊后，该社停止活动。\n\n## 简介\n\n“语丝社”是中国现代文学社团，因编辑出版《语丝》周刊得名，没有明确的组织机构，一般指刊物的编辑者及主要撰稿人。该刊于1924年11月17日在北京创刊。由孙伏园、周作人先后主编。主要撰稿人有鲁迅、周作人、川岛、刘半农、章衣萍 、林语堂、钱玄同、江绍原等。 该刊多发表针砭时弊的杂感小品。\n1927年10月，《语丝》被奉系军阀张作霖查封。同年12月在上海复刊，为第4卷第1期。先后由鲁迅、柔石、李小峰主编。主要撰稿人为鲁迅、周作人、章衣萍、韩侍桁、杨骚、陈学昭等。1930年3月10日出至第5卷第52期停刊。\n周刊以发表杂感、短评、随笔为主，兼及其他形式的文艺创作和有关社会 、历史的研究 文章 。语丝社以鲁迅为代表，在反对封建思想、反击复古逆流的斗争中，在围绕北京女师大风潮、三一八惨案，抨击北洋军阀统治，揭穿所谓“正人君子 ”帮凶面目的斗争中以及后来在革命文学的讨论中，都起过积极作用。但被泛称为语丝派的人们的立场、思想倾向各有不同。早在北京时，周作人、林语堂主张所谓“费厄泼赖”(费厄泼赖，英语Fair Play的音译，原为体育运动竞赛和其他竞技所用的术语。意思是光明正大的比赛，不要用不正当的手段,胜利者对失败者要宽大，不要过于认真，不要穷追猛打。)，不打 “落水狗” ，鲁迅曾立予批驳 。后在上海时，创造社、太阳社指责语丝社主张“趣味文学”，认为是革命文学的对立面。事实上，鲁迅当时就在《语丝》上发表了一系列关于革命文学的正确主张。他对创造社、太阳社的批评，和周作人、韩侍桁等人否定革命文学，是根本不同的。\n\n## 名字来由\n\n得名于《语丝》周刊。《语丝》创刊于1924年11 月，1930年3月停刊，语丝社随之消散。《语丝》主要撰稿人有孙伏园、周作人、鲁迅、林语堂等。它是中国现代文学史上最早以散文创作为主的刊物，主要发表杂感、短评、小品等。语丝社作家的散文创作形成了独具风格的\"语丝文体\"，这种文体在思想内容上任意而谈，斥旧促新，在艺术上以文艺性短论和随笔为主要形式，泼辣幽默，讽刺强烈，文字中\"富于俏皮的语言和讽刺的意味\"，特色是\"任意而谈，无所顾忌，要催促新的产生，对于有害于新的旧物，则极力加以排击，——但应该产生怎样的‘新'，却并无明白的表示，而一到觉得有些危机之际，也还是故意隐约其词\"。以鲁迅为代表的尖锐泼辣的杂文和以周作人、林语堂代表的幽雅的小品形成了该社散文创作两大类，对散文发展有重要影响。\n\n## 主要成员\n\n主编：孙伏园、周作人\n撰稿人：鲁迅、周作人、川岛、刘半农、章衣萍、林语堂、钱玄同、江绍原、韩侍桁、杨骚、陈学昭等\n\n## 主导思想\n\n语丝社倡导“文明批评”与“社会批评”，实际上继承了《新青年》批判旧思想、旧文化、旧道德和鞭挞社会丑恶与黑暗的精神传统。在思想、文化及政治各条战线上,语丝社与“现代评论派”、北洋军阀政府、国民党新军阀及社会上的各种新与旧的黑暗势力发生了激烈的交锋。\n\n## 发展历程\n\n要认识语丝社，首先得认识《晨报副刊》，《晨报副刊》是新文学运动早期著名的“四大副刊”之一。出版于北京的《晨报》原名《晨钟报》，是以梁启超，汤化龙为首的”研究系的机关报。《晨报副刊》是《晨报》的副刊，它于1921年10月12日正式出版。孙伏园任《晨报副刊》总编辑的时候，得到了鲁迅，周作人，刘半农，钱玄同，林语堂，顾颉刚等人的大力支持。到1924年，《晨报》总编辑由刘勉己取代了蒲伯英，他对孙伏园编辑的副刊极为不满意，决定进行改革，将已经确定好文章的刊物中鲁迅的作品《我的失恋》取掉。孙伏园辞职，而又决定在报刊事业上有所发展，并企图通过创建另一个刊物来“报复”《晨报》，尽管语丝社的成立有着更有广阔和复杂的政治时事及思想上的背景，但这次“抽稿风波”成了《语丝》出现的直接催化剂。\n同时，我们要认识语丝社，还得了另一个文学社团：新潮社。语丝社的筹备会上，除章小川外，都是新潮社的重要成员。《新潮》是由北京大学学生所办的刊物，它呼应《新青年》反对封建思想，倡导民主科学的立场，迅速成为新文化运动中的一支重要的力量。鲁迅主张将《新潮》不要办成一个纯学术的刊物，而是应将重点放在对于中国腐朽的旧思想，旧道德和旧文化的批判上。\n在新潮社中，周作人更一度担任主任编辑，另一个原因是《语丝》社在当时没有自己的出版与发行基地，所行的工作都在北京大学第一院新潮社进行。\n在认识语丝社的整个过程中,我们不容忽视的要了解一个出版机构：北新书局。北新书局是由新潮社转化而来。这种转变显得很自然。在后期，新潮社相当于一个出版机构了。由于李小峰大学毕业后专注于这一块事业，自然而然也就成了北新书局的老板，其它社员也默认了这个老板的身份。\n在北新书局创办初期，鲁迅给予了李小峰许多帮助。除了经济上的帮助外，还在装帧等方面给予了指点。并亲自参加到其中。鲁迅后来与李小峰及北新书局保持了十年多的关系，直到生命的结束。\n北新书局成立之后，《语丝》的印刷，发行等事务性的工作，就全部交由李小峰经管。北新书局后来移到上海，在上海期间，鲁迅与北新书局的合作，并不只限于《语丝》周刊。鲁迅与郁达夫一起为北新书局主持了另外一种文学史上具有一定影响的刊物《奔流》，并长期为《北新》半月刊提供译稿。但北新书局与鲁迅关系中不和谐在鲁迅定居上海不久即出现了。1927年，李小峰和孙伏园因为经济问题发生纠纷。鲁迅在致章川岛的信中有所提及，在1928年9月致章川岛的信中，鲁迅再次表示了对李小峰的不满。最后发展到通过法律手段解决。\n《语丝》是一个没有严格组织程序的文学团体。周作人虽然没有经过“合法的程序”，而实际上在语丝社中行使着主编的权利，说明周作人在语丝社中有着较高的威望和地位。可鲁迅在这个时期在思想文化界的影响不在周作人之下，可为什么行使主编之权的不是鲁迅而是周作人主要有以下几个原因：一是语丝社的基本班底都是原新潮社的成员，而周作人曾经担任过新潮社的主编；二是语丝社由孙伏园提议，在与周氏兄弟的关系中，孙伏园倾向于周作人。三是鲁迅没有出席过语丝社的一些会议，与社员之间的联系较少；四是当时鲁迅是教育部职员，作为政府官员，不宜参加民间社团。综合而定，自然在北京时期的语丝社主编是周作人。鲁迅虽然没有担任主编，仍是核心人物。他对于《语丝》编辑方针，会通过其他几位主要社员进行传递到周作人那里，并对于出版，印刷，发生都提出了自己具体的意见。\n语丝社和新潮社还存在着某种内在的联系。新潮社是在《新青年》的影响下成立且为之呼应并摇旗呐喊的文学社团，而《语丝》更是《新青年》的继承，它前期在批判封建思想陈旧观念腐朽文化方面不遗余力，它以几条战线上同时和社会黑暗势力针锋相对的斗争，使得它在20年代的中国思想文化界所发生的作用几乎不亚于五四时期的《新青年》。\n《语丝》杂志出版不到一个月的时间，在北京出版了另一份杂志《现代评论》，这是一个综合性的周刊，每逢星期六出版。在思想上倾向于自由主义，希望用西方的自由，民主，个人主义等观念来改变中国社会。\n在《语丝》中，周作人和鲁迅起了极大的作用，两兄弟的关系破裂于1923年7月，周氏兄弟失和的原因，历来有种种说法，分析和猜测。两人的关系成了“东有启明，西有长庚”，“两星永不相见”。但1924年下半年到1926年上半年这一段时间里，两者却因为《语丝》连在了一起。尽管两人从来不见面，写起文章与旁人作笔斗的时候却是一个鼻孔出气。但鲁迅攻击徐志摩和陈源等人时，笔尖带刺，从不会给他们留情面，相对来说，周作人平和一些。他与徐志摩的关系一直不错，并且进行过相互约稿。在《现代评论》杂志创办之后，还参加了这个杂志组织的聚会。在《现代评论》中与陈西滢的“叫局事件”中却表现的相当激烈。徐志摩，胡适的劝解均没有起到太大的作用。\n周氏兄弟的配合作战，还有一个例证：就是当狂飙社的高长虹与鲁迅发生冲突并对鲁迅进行攻击的时候，周作人主动出来用文章攻击了高长虹。\n鲁迅一生坚持思想的独立和自由，从不依附于任何政治势力和党派，也不轻信任何新潮的学说观念，思考问题总是从“本心”出发，“依自不依他”，“怀疑主义”的立场一直坚持到革命的最后一息。\n周作人也是一生强调“个人”的首要性，他在中国思想史和文学史上留下了一个“智者”的形象，也正由于他的“怀疑与否定一切”以及“无所崇信”。有人说周作人是“复古派”的，这是不正确的。他要“复”和“古”是“禁欲与纵欲的调和”，不过是他的灵魂空处贵族趣味的投影而已。但在周作人的世界里，并不是只有贵族趣味，也有平民精神，而且在他的意识里这是两种可以并行不悖的东西。周作人宣布要取消“文学家”的招牌，他显然不是要去当思想家，更不是要去当改革家和革命家。他不做“文学家”，而是要去做“文章家”。\n周作人的办刊思想是：他既要“反抗”也讲“趣味”，他在“批评文明”与“批评社会”的同时也不会忘了“生活的艺术”。编辑时更不因读者而改变。全部《语丝》的历史中，当属于周作人任主编时期在社会上产生的影响最大。凡属于重大的政治文化事件，在这里都可以找到几篇相关的评论文章。\n周作人担任主编的另一成就是举荐和培养了作家废名，因为废名加入，《语丝》的文学性加强，废名是较“纯粹”的文学家，后被载入中国现代文学史中。\n1927年10月，《语丝》被奉系军阀查封，《语丝》的编辑从北京转向上海。同北京版《语丝》相比，上海版《语丝》给人的感觉是一份更接近文学的刊物。这个时期，推荐出不少新人。\n从第五卷开始，《语丝》由柔石作主编，这当然全靠鲁迅的的大力推荐。作为一份名声已经在外的老杂志，它过去的宗旨，风格和编辑思路肯定会对他造成影响和制约。这当中除了惯性的延续，柔石对于鲁迅的敬重也是一个重要的影响因素。体现柔石“学术性”的还有翻译文章。\n《语丝》的“杂感”与“美文”，是精神自主的个人所呈现出的心灵世界的不同方面。“杂感”更多地关注社会，而“美文”则带着更丰富的内心世界的信息，但思想的自由和判断的独立则是共同的。语丝社作家对于自身的定位是人文学知识分子，他们既有意地与“黑狗咬黄狗”的政治保持距离，也与“纯粹”学术保持距离。\n鲁迅曾经说过这样一段话：文学团体不是豆荚，包含在里面的，始终是豆．大约集成时本已各不相同，后来更有种种变化．语丝社自1924年在北京创刊，到1930年3月于上海出版最后一期，共出260期，前后经历五年多，在中国现代文学和文化史上产生了相当大的影响。但最终因为编辑中心的转变，主编的变化而走向了消亡。",

{"name": "纳粹德国海军", "documents": ["## 纳粹德国海军\n纳粹德国海军（Kriegsmarine，意为战争海军）是指1935年至1946年期间的德国海军。战争海军取代了第一次世界大战的德意志帝国海军和魏玛共和国的国家海军，为德意志国防军中的海军力量。战争海军起源于一战后《凡尔赛条约》的严格限制，当时明文规定其吨位总数和禁止潜艇的研制，但在威玛共和国的海军人员暗中推动下，与外国企业合作研究海军科技。其后阿道夫·希特勒上台废除《凡尔赛条约》和签订《英德海军协定》，德国海军开始大量建造新式船舰。在重建的过程里，德国海军曾研制一个特殊的舰种：装甲舰和执行大型造舰计划：Z计划。原本德国海军预计1945年为开战时间，计划建立一支能与头号假想敌：英国皇家海军匹敌的水面舰队，其中包括建造航空母舰。然而第二次世界大战在1939年爆发，德国海军在许多方面都尚未准备，便以一支有限力量的海军去攻击运载英国国内需求物资的商船，并消灭因分散护航而较弱的英国海军舰队。\n起初德国海军战果颇多，击沉不少同盟国商船，但因为希特勒对水面舰队始终印象不佳，认为其建造缓慢且战果小；而潜艇部队建造速度快，还在法国陷落而取得西部港口后，对英国发动大规模的潜艇战中取得一系列丰硕的战果。德国海军随著战事的进行，开始将战力中心自水面舰移往潜艇部队的「吨位战」，而前者逐渐转为存在舰队的功能。德国海军的潜艇数量在战争爆发时是当时世界海军列强中最少者，但因为潜艇总司令卡尔·邓尼茨以狼群战术、先进的通信制度和战略规划而取得所有交战国潜艇部队里最大的战绩。到了1943年德国潜艇在大西洋越来越力不从心，盟军不但破解了密码机和开发了多种先进反潜武器，如更先进的声呐、雷达、深水炸弹，还投入了大量护卫航空母舰和反潜战斗群进行护航；同年5月德国潜艇因为损失过高而放弃了狼群战术，改以单舰巡弋的方式继续作战。战争末期德国海军虽研制了先进的通气管式潜艇，如XXI级潜艇和XXIII级，并投入使用直到战争结束，但仍无法扭转战败的结果。\n##

对德国海军的限制\n1900年德意志帝国为赶上最后一波的殖民浪潮和阿尔弗雷德·冯·铁必制对海军扩建的提倡，而与国际列强展开建造无畏舰的军备竞赛，并建立了一支世界上规模数一数二的舰队。第一次世界大战爆发后，德国水面舰队——公海舰队——不仅多次与英国皇家海军交战，还以潜艇部队发起无限制潜艇战，击沉多艘协约国船只。然而在日德兰海战后，德国海军虽获得战术上的胜利，却被封锁于港湾中而无法行动。公海舰队司令赖因哈德·舍尔上将无法让舰队出击，取得比潜艇部队更高的战果，而其水兵士气日益降低，最后引发了基尔港水兵叛变的德国革命。1918年11月11日德国投降，根据停战协定，公海舰队需驶入英国斯卡帕湾接受扣押，然而舰队却在1919年6月21日被德国海军路德维希·冯·罗伊特少将暗中计划的秘密行动而集体自沉，目的是防止船只被战胜国所瓜分。协约国对此行动极为不满，以德国违反协定为由，将其几近全部有登记的船舶没收、拆走码头设备、各大造船厂机具相继被解体，并在往后的条约和限制中对德国海军更加严格。在自沉行动和5艘现代化的轻巡洋舰作为战争赔偿后，德国海军仅剩下8艘旧型无畏舰拿骚级和赫尔戈兰级）、32艘驱逐舰和鱼雷艇，数量少、性能也过时，仅能做海防一用。1921年1月1日依照《凡尔赛条约》规定，德国成立了新的国家海军，作为威玛共和国的海军力量。\n《凡尔赛条约》严格限制了德国海军的规模与实力，德国只能拥有15,000名的海军人员，规定服役长达25年；船舰仅能保有6艘排水量10,000吨以下的旧式战斗舰、6艘巡洋舰、12艘驱逐舰、12艘鱼雷艇以及额外规定禁止拥有军用飞机、航空母舰和潜艇。虽然协约国允许替换舰龄达20年的战斗舰与巡洋舰，但限制战斗舰吨位不可超过10,000吨、不得装有口径超过11吋的舰砲，使其功能仅近乎重巡洋舰；而巡洋舰的替换则规定排水量6,000吨，能配装的最大火砲口径仅有6吋；驱逐舰则为800吨、鱼雷艇为200吨；这样的缩编使得留下的海军人员都是优秀分子，往后也都成了战争海军中重要的领导人物。\n### 国家海军时期\n德国潜艇曾在一战取得辉煌战绩，然而在《凡尔赛条约》禁止建造潜艇和协约国监管后，德国各大船厂虽有世界领先的潜艇技术却苦无客户，这时日本与阿根廷联系了德国数个造船厂，希望购买设计图与转授技术以建立本国潜艇部队。这两个规模庞大的生意使得德国串连了各大造船厂和企业，并由克虏伯发起，联合成立了一家空壳公司：NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw，其总部设于荷兰海牙，以躲避凡尔赛条约的监督。船舶建设工程局存在目的除了为整合各造船厂技术和资源、联合接订单外，也要和国际潜艇技术接轨，使德国不至于落后，但到了1925年船舶建设工程局经营不善，在面临倒闭的情况下，德国海军私下与其公司人员联系。德国海军也透过一个名为「结算咨询公司」的空壳企业加入了船舶建设工程局的投资，并在之后注资了100万马克，成为该公司最大股东，还额外许诺每年补贴12万马克，德国军方要求该公司为将来德国重建潜艇部队时，能以新技术与设计予以支援；因此，原本为国内造船业而存在的船舶建设工程局转型为德国海军专门的研究机构。除了船舶建设工程局外，海军还接触了其他民间企业，同时进行水雷、鱼雷磁触发引信和舰载机液压弹射器的研究。\n1920年国家海军首任海军总司令保罗·贝恩克上将在经费有限的情况下，打算重建一支现代化的海军，其组建目标为保护近海，他认为德国海军的舰只过于老旧，必须大量汰换。他下令组建两支战队：北海舰队和波罗的海舰队，用来控制波罗的海海口，以防止法国与波兰联手对付德国。1925年德国战后建造的第一艘轻巡洋舰：恩登号下水，该舰完全照条约要求建造，其后又相继建造了新式的Möwe (1926)和Raubtier-Klasse，为战后德国海军赶上国际技术的第一批新舰队。1924年贝恩克的职位被汉斯·曾克尔上将所取代，曾克尔任内最后一年正值第一批旧式战舰达到合约要求，允许汰换的时候。这时军方内部对于以何种军舰来取代旧舰有两种不同的意见，是建造远洋用重巡洋舰还是近海防御的铁甲舰，最后以条约的要求设计了一款新式的舰种：装甲舰，主要特征为战斗舰等级的火力、航速快和轻装甲。然而在装甲舰首舰：德国号于1931年下水前，威玛共和国国会议员注意到了结算咨询公司的存在，反对重新武装的议员使议会下令调查，结果幕后的各研究机关，以及同意资助的海军高层人员一一被揪出，包括曾克尔上将，也因此下台退役，重建海军的工作受到了打击。但新上任的海军总司令埃里希·雷德尔上将很快地控制了混乱的局面，他亲自前去会见政府成员，说服海军重建之必要性，政府态度因而从不满转为支持。雷德尔还将同时期的研究多加了货船改装为伪装巡洋舰和将渔船改装为扫雷艇的计划，还规划了一个平民飞行训练计划，为往后要建立的海军航空兵做准备。船舶建设工程局也接连接获土耳其、芬兰、西班牙和苏联的潜艇订单，德国海军也因此获得大量宝贵的技术与大规模生产资料。1933年10月德国海军秘密在基尔设立一所标明「反潜防御学校」的军校，实际上在训练潜艇舰员。\n### 纳粹党与Z计划\n1933年1月纳粹党成为德国执政党，希特勒支持雷德尔重组海军舰队，并多次保证会极力避免与英国的战争以争取时间。1935年3月16日希特勒正式宣布单方面废止《凡尔赛条约》，并将国家海军被改名为战争海军。英国对于德国重整军备的动作颇为担忧，为保持两国较不紧张的关系，于1935年6月18日与德国签订了《英德海军协定》，该协定缓和了英国国内对另一场海军军备竞赛的担忧，但德国受益更多：德国可以装备潜艇，并能建立规模为英国皇家海军35%总吨位的舰队，总吨位约40万吨，其中战列舰总排水量为18万，这也限制了新建造的4艘战列舰，每艘排水量皆不能超过45,000吨；而潜艇部队则为英国潜艇的45%。当时英国皇家海军拥有12艘战列舰、3艘战列巡洋舰、8艘航空母舰、54艘巡洋舰和169艘驱逐舰，认为即使德国违反此协定，也有足够余力对付德国。6月29日，在条约签完仅11天，第一艘新潜艇：German submarine U-1 (1935)就在基尔军港下水服役。虽然德国潜艇已可正常装备，但希特勒不想暴露其战争野心，未批准大规模的潜艇生产计划，并表示希望一切问题借由外交手段解决，重整军备不过是将德国变回一个「正常」的国家，对英国释出没有要进行军备竞赛的善意与争取国际的同情。\n1937年11月5日希特勒召集军官宣布可能必须动用武力来解决一些领土问题，包括奥地利、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰。继德奥合并和慕尼黑会议后，希特勒于1938年9月开始要求海军作战部拟定对英国的战争，即是后来的「Z计划」，并于1939年1月27日被希特勒所批准执行，并给予优先于其他军备的资源。Z计划是以英国皇家海军为主、法国海军为副假想敌为对象，设计的6年大型水面舰队建造计划。意在英国尚未做好战争准备之前，建立起一支能与其匹敌的舰队，并以大规模的舰队进行战略性的部署作战。此计划规模非常庞大，若如期完成，德国海军将拥有能与皇家海军相搏的实力。Z计划内容有数种版本：\n### 海军战略与建军路线\n#### 一战到二战的海军思想\nZ计划的结构是由德国海军两种的战略思想集结改良而成，最初德意志帝国海军是一支由陆军将领担任指挥的小型舰队，陆军的战略与战术上也影响海军甚剧，其后德国海军之父：铁必制过去主张「风险理论」与引诱敌人部分兵力来进行舰队决战的想法，但其因为德国地理位置的致命缺陷，导致一战中期日德兰海战爆发、与英国整支大舰队交火后，公海舰队被封锁，因为铁必制个人的影响力甚剧，德国海军直到威玛共和时期仍有保持其战略观点。1926年，Wolfgang Wegener海军中将首次提出了地缘战略和存在舰队的应用理论，并对海军内部提出德国对英国的地理劣势重要性、战略目标的检讨，认为铁必制在海战中过于注重消灭敌人舰队的有生力量，而没有将其作以更灵活的应用，专注进行破交战。德国在地理位置上一直处于不利位置，英国的海上生命线位于大西洋西侧，而德国附近的海域仅有北海和波罗的海，德国舰队在试图穿越抵达至大西洋前就会遭到英国其近于本土的舰队攻击，且能有效的支援，反之德国则无。魏格纳虽提倡控制海上交通线和在地缘战略上有其著眼点，却过度轻视了英德两国的舰队质与量上的差距，认为地理优势可以完全弥补一切。即使如此，因为一次大战铁必制理论的失败，德国海军转而认为魏格纳的「交通控制」理论才是其海军发展的进取核心，并在军中刺激许多年轻军官的其相关战略研究，但也受到保守军官的批评。魏格纳提出新海军思想的同时，德国海军正开始规划重建舰队的工作，正需要一个军事学说来决定路线，新海军思想中以胡戈·冯·瓦尔代尔-哈茨的《明日的海战》（Naval Warfare of Tomorrow）论文对其观点的叙述最为完整与极端，认为舰队间的战斗已过时，将来海战的发展会转为对海上贸易线—商船的攻防战，而1920年代的德国海军也接受了此思想。\n#### 水面舰队与潜艇的联合作战\n雷德尔是反对魏格纳理论的保守军官之一，在担任海军总司令期间亦曾查禁其思想，然而在他所提出的Z计划就有其交通战的想法，同时也结合以优势兵力进行巡洋舰决战的铁必制主张。雷德尔认为北海能以一支战斗舰队来突破英军的封锁，同时派出多艘巡洋舰、潜艇进入大西洋和其他英国通航线进行交通战，迫使英国为保护船团而大量采用护航船团，分散皇家海军的实力，进而相继消灭护航舰和本土舰队。这样的战略不但能造成英国大量物资的损失，也能牵制敌人相当可观的军力，而潜艇在一战中的失败被认为是因为单艘作战能力不足，才会被已分散的护航兵力所击败，若结合水面舰队和潜艇就能解决此问题，同时潜艇的存在更可限制船团的队形，让水面舰队的攻击更为容易。也因此，除了早期制造的3艘德国级装甲舰，Z计划仍要继续建造这种以商船和脆弱的护航舰为主要攻击对象、而非主力战舰的军舰。\n#### 潜艇战斗群舰队\n除了雷德尔的Z计划舰队外，德国海军中有另一派不同的主张，就是卡尔·邓尼兹上校的潜艇战斗群理论，也是形成日后的狼群战术核心。邓尼兹认为只要持续进行「吨位战」，让英国建造新船只的速度低于被击沉的速度，就能减少英国海上通航线运回本土的物资，包括战争工业所需要的一切原物料和人民所需的粮食，进而对德国投降。邓尼兹曾在一战中指挥过潜艇，根据经验他认为若要攻击英国的护航船团，唯一的方法就是将潜艇集中并分为多个「群」，进行严密的战术控制和协同战斗。邓尼兹在《英德海军协定》签下后，提出了大型的潜艇建造计划，主张将全部用于建造德国水面舰队的资源用来制造潜艇，其中以制造大量机动力强、适合远洋作战的中型潜艇（即指VII级潜艇）最为重要，至少要300艘，其中100艘在海上巡弋、100艘在往返基地与作战海域、100艘在基地修整待命，并保持与其他类型潜艇3:1的比例。起初他的计划不被海军总部所接受，海军总部认为未来潜艇仍会是单独作战的型态，比较适合建造拥有较大口径舰砲和长续航力的大型潜艇（即指I级潜艇），即将潜艇用于类似巡洋舰的功能。这个争论直到1939年夏季多次对英国护航船团攻击的演习后，邓尼兹才说服了海军总部。然而即使已经说服了雷德尔和希特勒，德国仍没有将潜艇的生产放在第一位，也因此大战爆发后狼群战术迟迟无法实行。\n## 第二次世界大战\n### 战争初期\n1939年8月19日德国海军总司令埃里希·雷德尔对海军下达战争动员令，将所有海军舰艇进入至备战状态，雷德尔认为动员令不久即会解除，英法两国会妥协但泽的领土纷争，但在9月1日德国入侵波兰（其中战争海军参与了西盘半岛战役和砲轰但泽湾）后2天，两国对德宣战。当雷德尔听到宣战消息时，他说道：「现在，水面舰队能做的只有一件事，表现出他们懂得如何英勇赴死」。在Z计划才刚起工的情况下，德国海军此时能出战的只有2艘战斗巡洋舰、3艘装甲舰、两艘重巡洋舰、6艘轻巡洋舰和共34艘的驱逐舰和鱼雷艇，邓尼兹在日后说道：「早在战争爆发时，我们就被打败了，因为德国并没有在海上做好万全准备」。德国最高统帅部迅速拟定了作战计划，雷德尔以早就派遣于海外的两艘装甲舰发起攻势，开始攻击盟军船只；而邓尼兹则赶紧派遣潜艇进入大西洋，德国官方宣布「无论是否悬挂中立国之旗帜都将会攻击」，此时潜艇数量少以及希特勒下令潜艇必须遵守《捕获法则》行事而难以有重大战绩，邓尼兹还是希望在英国启用护航制度前尽可能多击沉一些船只。9月3日开往美国的英国客轮SS Athenia因为意外而被German submarine U-30 (1936)潜艇击沉，成为开战后第1艘被德国海军击沉的船只，英国认为德国已启用无限制潜艇战的作战模式，于是以护航制度来因应。英国在9月份被击沉了43艘船，但开始护航后就只被击沉1艘。由于英国已启用护航制度，邓尼兹想进行狼群战术来因应，但潜艇数量太少，因而在第一次的集结过程中被击沉3艘。9月30日在邓尼兹的说服下，希特勒下令潜艇部队不必遵守《捕获法则》而使得潜艇的猎杀战果大有上升，但数量仍是非常的少。英国方面对护航制度存有歧见，一方认为它是一种防守而无实际成效，应额外组建猎杀潜艇的舰队；另一方又认为不该浪费护航兵力，导致其制度没有贯彻实施。德国水面舰队则在拉普拉塔河口海战中损失了斯比上将号，其后又有2艘轻巡洋舰被英军潜艇重创，于港中修补，雷德尔派遣了数艘伪装巡洋舰于海外攻击商船，其他舰只则留在军港中。\n虽然陆上西线一直维持假战状态，但到了1940年因为第一次世界大战英国曾利用挪威领海封锁德国舰队，以及希特勒担心其阻断瑞典铁矿砂的运输和维德孔·吉斯林的游说，德军于4月9日发动威瑟演习作战进攻挪威与丹麦，海军同陆空军协同作战，德国虽然最后成功占领各目标，但海军表现颇糟，损失了1艘重巡洋舰、两艘轻巡洋舰、10艘驱逐舰和4艘潜艇，同时也因为鱼雷性能问题导致潜艇攻击战果少、艇员士气低落。威瑟堡行动的结果对于德国海军战略拥有决定性的影响，使德国突破英国的海上封锁、获得了从日德兰至北角的所有港口。1940年5月德军发起春季攻势占领法国，英国远征军撤退至本土，之后义大利对英法宣战。希特勒登陆英国的海狮计划因德国海军在挪威的损失、替登陆部队护航得交由空军，之后因为不列颠空战失败而无限期的推延，雷德尔因此而继续派遣军舰前往大西洋攻击商船。\n### 「第一段美好时光」（1940年7月至12月）\n法国投降为德国攻击英国海上通航线带来了极为便利的条件，德国潜艇不必再从威廉港出发，耗费油料和一星期的航行时间才能进入大西洋，能够从法国港口更有效的触及英国海上生命线，大西洋上的潜艇活动数量也因此增加了25％。由于法国沦陷，德国即将进攻英国本土，皇家海军舰队多调回待命，海上护航兵力变得相当薄弱，在1940年6月和7月每一支船团仅配有一艘军舰护航，而护航舰与岸基飞机的反潜设备只能对付水下目标而不能对在水面攻击商船的潜艇，再加上英国因为担心受到空中德国军机的攻击而要求所有商船改以爱尔兰往苏格兰的北海峡航道航行，导致航线拥挤，德国潜艇得以在1940年7月至12月于获得重大战果，艇长称其为「第一段美好时光」，光德国潜艇就击沉了278艘商船，共1,492,054总吨数的物资。大西洋运输物资的损失直到1940年9月2日美国的富兰克林·D·罗斯福总统透过《Destroyers for Bases Agreement》提供了50艘驱逐舰给英国，情况才稍有改善。这段时间里虽然德国潜艇战果丰硕，但因为潜艇数量太少，难以发起狼群战术，虽然邓尼兹曾利用义大利的潜艇试图贯彻此战术，但因为人员训练和作战方式等问题而作罢；同时也因为缺乏长程侦察机而无法充分利用这段时间获得更大的战果。\n### 俾斯麦号战斗舰的沉没\n德国水面舰队于1940年10月派出数艘装甲舰、重巡洋舰和伪装巡洋舰由北海进入大西洋攻击商船，在海上大有斩获，迫使英国作好战斗以迎击。1941年5月18日德国海军发起莱茵演习行动，企图由欧根亲王号和俾斯麦号组成破袭舰队，突入北大西洋执行破交作战(破坏英国的海上交通线)。此计划曾遭舰队司令君特·吕特晏斯的反对，他指出将此作战延到两艘战斗巡洋舰（指的是沙恩霍斯特号和格奈森瑙号，它们曾在4月上旬受创，进入布雷斯特翻修，而皇家海军又于此港外布下多处雷区，使得出勤时间一延再延）做好准备再进行，但遭雷德尔驳回，他指出若是到夏季才开始执行将会失去天候和昼短夜长这两个有利条件；更重要的是，希特勒已在准备巴巴罗萨作战，陆军和空军的需求将为最优先，若不在海上取得惊人胜利，难使希特勒继续支持海军舰队。之后，在5月24日爆发了丹麦海峡海战，俾斯麦号和欧根亲王号击沉皇家海军的旧舰：胡德号战列巡洋舰、重创威尔士亲王号战列舰，而在3天后皇家海军派遣了大量军舰前往、搜索拦截俾斯麦号，并将其击沉。莱茵演习行动以德国海军的失败告终，使得希特勒对大型水面舰的兴致降至谷底，成了水面舰队和雷德尔的转捩点，也显示皇家海军已开始集结舰队反击。到了11月皇家海军也消灭了所有在外巡弋的德国伪装巡洋舰。\n### 英国反击与苏联、美国参战\n德国潜艇部队的战绩于1940年10月达到最高峰，也开始使用狼群编队，但其后因为冬季的到来略有下降。英国则开始组织反击，重组了护航制度、将西航道司令部由普利茅斯改至利物浦、更换指挥官和进行更严谨的海空军合作，英国透过政府密码研究协会，对德国潜艇的电文和通信进行拦截，判断其出没位置，并向海军部提供适合的航线与护航舰艇资讯，此举大大改进了护航的效率。由于英军的反潜技术有了相当的经验，在1941年3月击沉了不少潜艇（英国每损失五艘商船就击沉一艘德国潜艇），其中还损失了3名王牌艇长。邓尼兹此时拥有的潜艇数量仍仅有27艘，他决定派遣它们前往更西边的航道，护航战舰和岸基飞机所不及处。1941年5月德国潜艇U-101被盟军所俘虏，并获得一台通信用的恩尼格玛密码机，同时也改善了测向仪技术、雷达系统。\n美国方面，罗斯福对德国潜艇态度越来越强硬，1939年9月23日美国就发表《巴拿马宣言》，划分了一个海上中立「安全区」，提供美国军舰保护该海域的船只，其后又有《驱逐舰协定》和《租借法案》、同意英国军舰于美国造船厂检修、还将其安全区向东延长，到了6月美国还驻军于冰岛，也使得德国与美国海军的关系越来越紧张。1941年6月英国破解了恩尼格玛密码，为反潜和护航作战提供了重要的帮助，但因为邓尼兹察觉到有异，下令将保密制度升级，英国的密码优势并未维持太久，反而被德国破解了英国海军部的密码。6月22日希特勒进攻苏联并调拨了相当的资源在对苏战争上，且要求邓尼兹不得攻击美国船舰以免其参战，英国则宣布将会支援苏联一切作战物资，并透过北冰洋航线送达。12月7日日本偷袭美国在夏威夷的珍珠港基地，美国因此对日宣战，德国也在12月11日对美国宣战，战场范围因而扩大了。\n### 「第二段美好时光」（1942年1月至8月）\n邓尼兹在1942年年底只有90艘潜艇，他认为要对美国发起攻势，在最短时间内击沉大量物资（每月810,000吨），以免其造船速度和反潜准备的增加导致大西洋海战德国失败。然而德国最高统帅部因为北非和马尔他战事告紧，一直要求邓尼兹挪出兵力前往地中海和直布罗陀海域，邓尼兹认为那是无谓的浪费。他策划了以美国船只为主要目标的击鼓行动，由于美国没有使用护航制度而不使用狼群战术。美国因为太平洋战争而调移了许多原本可用来攻击潜艇的军舰，《租借法案》也转移不少驱逐舰给了英国，使得美国本土海域缺乏防御，美国海军总司令恩斯特·金恩上将认为在护航船舰不足的情况下建立护航船团没有意义，只有在拥有必要资源时才组建。德国潜艇于1942年1月至8月在美国东岸大有斩获，并称其为「第二段美好时光」。\n美国东海岸负责反潜作战的大西洋舰队所组建出的反潜舰队也多为不适合此作战的船只且缺乏训练，而从美国陆军航空军征调用来作为反潜机的B-17和B-24也因为陆海军指挥权和从轰炸机转为反潜机不适应而有各个问题。德国潜艇则因为每天截获许多盟军商船所发出的无线电讯号而大肆攻击船团，美国则在反潜作战上缺乏搜索与追击的实战经验，海空力量也没有协同，深水炸弹等武器性能也低落。一直到5月美国海军才开始了护航制度并对反潜制度加以改进。邓尼兹因为美国东海岸防御能力逐渐增强，他开始将潜艇派到防御松散的墨西哥湾和北大西洋等其他海域以维持吨位战计算所需达到的每月击沉数。1942年夏越来越多德国潜艇下水服役，邓尼兹因而恢复启用狼群战术，还有派遣潜艇运输秘密渗透破坏单位进入美国。\n### 海军战略转移\n德国战略上因为援苏船队的存在与英国多次派出突击队登陆挪威进行破坏行动，使希特勒认为其试图在斯堪地拉维亚半岛登陆反攻，他对此说道：「挪威是这场战争的『命运之地』」，要求「每一艘可动用的船舰都要部署于挪威。」，希特勒尤其要求从位在法国的主力舰穿越英吉利海峡，协防挪威，海军作战部便拟定Operation Cerberus，成功移防了3艘主力舰和6艘驱逐舰，此外还向邓尼兹征调潜艇。邓尼兹认为此举使得大西洋海战原本就已显不够的潜艇兵力更加不足，但仍派遣了20艘潜艇。同时主力舰转往挪威也象征了德国海军放弃了远洋作战。1942年驻防挪威的德国海军舰队有5艘主力舰和10艘潜艇，其中对盟军战略部署最大的就是铁必制号战斗舰。\n1942年3月14日希特勒下令将北极船团定为与俄国战役相关的重要战略目标，要求将其彻底阻绝。但运往摩尔曼斯克港口的船团仅受到德国在挪威的海空军零星攻击，主要是德国燃料短缺，严重限制了舰队的作战能力，1942年4月德国海军仅能获得月需求量10％的燃料，但潜艇因为使用柴油而未受影响，成了该地区真正的攻击主力。1942年12月31日在挪威北海爆发了巴伦支海海战，错失歼灭援苏北极船队的机会，希特勒对此结果十分不满，也成了德国水面舰命运的转捩点，下令拆毁所有含驱逐舰的舰队和取消水面舰的建造，将舰上的火砲、装甲与官兵用以加强大西洋长城的防御设施，雷德尔抗辩无效后就自己请辞了，而邓尼兹则被任命为新的海军总司令。邓尼兹虽为潜艇指挥官但了解舰队存在之价值，他说服了希特勒保留了水面舰队（但停止了建造），改将海军资源都投入潜艇中。在1943年发生的北角海战中，皇家海军击沉了沙恩霍斯特号，之后大多数德国水面舰退至港口作为存在舰队，牵制皇家海军的部署。而提尔皮茨号战斗舰不断地穿梭于挪威的峡湾中，盟军认为其对援苏商船运输造成非常大的威胁，持续以各种行动试图瘫痪或击沉它，最后在1944年的Operation Catechism中成功击沉，从此德国水面舰队也无对盟军实际的影响力了。\n### 潜艇战转捩点\n和水面舰队驻于挪威的情况相比，大西洋海战逐渐进入白热化阶段，双方投入之兵力甚多，邓尼兹取得了希特勒的信任加速生产潜艇，1943年的狼群规模越来越大。德国海军参谋本部认为在1943年同盟国可建造1,080万吨的新船（实际上是1,238.4万吨），因此平均每月都应要击沉总计900,000吨的船只。在2月最后10天击沉了28艘船（183,650吨）、3月的前10天共击沉41艘船（229,949吨）、后10天又击沉了44艘船（282,009吨）。在德国潜艇大有斩获的同时，同盟国也在进步，包括改良超远程飞机和使用新式反潜装备、「利式」探照灯、刺猬砲和新型深水炸弹等，德军用来躲避盟军的雷达装置和密码机也遭破解，盟国护航船只开始大量出现护卫航空母舰，也开始从英国本土轰炸德国潜艇制造厂，反潜人员的技术也逐渐进步，潜艇更是无法应付飞机这种「不对称」的战斗兵种，盟军巨大的生产力也令护航舰艇大量增加，也开始组建了「支援群」，专配于护航船团对潜艇采取攻击。\n德国潜艇的损失开始增加，2月有14艘被击沉、3月13艘、4月12艘，但到5月22日该月的损失就有31艘。到了5月底邓尼兹认为吨位战已经宣告失败，盟军已获得战略主导权，但他还是派出潜艇于海上游猎（单艇巡弋），9月和10月德国潜艇仅击沉了9艘船，但却损失26艘潜艇。邓尼兹在记事本上写道：「很显然，潜艇除了对敌人的牵-{制}-作战外已毫无作为。」但他还是持续生产潜艇。邓尼兹打算使用新式潜艇继续与盟军作战，他和军备部长阿尔伯特·斯佩尔将潜艇制造厂规模扩增，把每一个零件在各个不同地方生产再送到同一处组装，大大增加了效率和抵抗盟军对船厂的轰炸。\n### 战争后期\n1944年纳粹德国节节败退，苏联红军从东部直捣德国本土，同时盟军也在法国开辟了第二战场，德国海军虽然派遣潜艇拦截登陆船只却战果极小，己方还损失多艘潜艇。不过在东部的波罗的海，尚保有制海权的德国海军仍能以残存的海军水面舰以砲火支援陆军逐渐撤退。德国东普鲁士的平民怕落入红军手中将被报复，海军组织起所有力量进行撤退，展开汉尼拔行动，成功抢救了200万名平民与300,000名士兵。到了战争最后阶段，邓尼兹还计划动用所有潜艇进行攻势，但仍无法挽回局面，在战争最后5周内共有83艘潜艇被击沉。海军还曾组织了小规模的步兵师到前线与陆军并肩作战。1945年4月30日希特勒自杀，根据其遗嘱任命邓尼兹为联邦大总统和国家元首。5月2日邓尼兹在弗伦斯堡组成新政府，5月5日邓尼兹命令所有U艇停止攻击行动及返回基地。海军总司令汉斯-格奥尔格·冯·弗里德堡于1945年5月代表战争海军签署投降书。5月8日德国正式投降，战争海军则到1946年才正式解散。\n### 其他战区\n自从义大利于1940年6月对英法宣战，就开辟了地中海战场。从1941年9月到1944年5月约有62艘德国潜艇穿过英国直布罗陀基地前往地中海，击沉了数艘盟军军舰和商船，德国潜艇在此主要任务是打击通往地中海英国马尔他基地的补给、支援义大利海军与掩护北非埃尔温·隆美尔的德意志非洲军海上补给线，然而直到战争结束都没有一艘地中海战区的潜艇回到他们原本的基地，它们多在战斗中被击沉或是投降时凿沉。邓尼兹认为德国海军在吨位战上不应浪费数量已经算少的潜艇赴往其他战场，大西洋才是决定性战场，但他的意见没有被采纳（主要原因是雷德尔于1940年建议希特勒将主战场转往地中海）。\n除了地中海外，战争海军还派遣潜艇和伪装巡洋舰前往太平洋、西非海域和印度洋击沉盟军商船，德国潜艇在此区常停驻于日本军港，少数之后成为了日本潜艇。\n另外还有在波罗的海与黑海和苏联舰队交战，同时维持东线北方集团军的补给。\n## 战后\n### 战争审判\n战争结束后，德国海军中的雷德尔和邓尼兹于纽伦堡审判中被起诉；英国海军坚决反对起诉两人，根据纽伦堡历史学家约翰·图萨斯（John Tusas）的报告，「英国海军认为德国海军进行的是一场合法公正的战争…，他们明白关于海军战争的法律是非常不严谨的，执行起来会有机可乘…」。英国法学家Humphrey Waldock认为：「审判德国海军会面临法律难题」，图萨斯还因此总结指控德国海军的证据是「不可靠和虚弱的」。美国海军高层也有其同感，因为他们自己也在战争中对日本发起了无限制潜艇战，且不会营救落水者，有时甚至还会攻击其救生艇上的船员。然而因为受到苏联和法国政府的坚持，以及其在纳粹德国重要的政治地位，两人仍被起诉。雷德尔因为在战争爆发之初已有高级职位（海军总司令），对以海军帮助希特勒的战争行动有其责任，3项主要罪名：「发起侵略战争」、「制订侵略计划」和「犯有战争罪行」皆起诉（危害人类罪没有起诉），但仅有制订侵略计划判决有罪（威瑟堡行动）。虽然此判决引起部分争议，雷德尔最后被判决终身监禁，然而在判决时的1946年他已有70岁高龄，故因而减刑并在1955年9月获释。对邓尼兹的审判中，第1条的「发起侵略战争」由于战争爆发之初邓尼兹仅为上校军衔而无罪；第2条的「制订侵略计划」虽然邓尼兹作为海军军官仅是听命行事，但陪审团仍判决其有罪；第3条的「犯有战争罪行」案例主要集中于拉克尼亚命令，指控邓尼兹于1942年12月发布该命令，要求艇长不营救落水者并暗示杀死幸存者。然而邓尼兹辩护律师提出多项证据作证绝无此事，且证人之言词有其漏洞，美国的太平洋总司令切斯特·威廉·尼米兹上将也给予相关资讯，纽伦堡法庭的美国大法官弗朗西斯·贝弗利·比德尔宣称：「德国人发起的潜艇战争比美国的还要公正」，并不支持邓尼兹在这项罪行上有罪，但法国与苏联法官坚持其有罪，最后宣判有罪，判处10年监禁（纽伦堡法庭中被判有罪者最短的刑期）。\n### 解散与改组\n战争结束后，德国海军只剩下少数军舰由战胜国处置。齐柏林伯爵号被苏联当作舰艇与战机的靶船。而大部分的驱逐舰和鱼雷艇则编入盟军的舰队中，驱逐舰被瓜分，莱比锡号载满毒气被拖往北海击沉，纽伦堡号进入苏联海军服役，改为马可罗夫上将号（Admiral Makarov）；欧根亲王号则是被美国使用于十字路行动，测试水下核爆对水面船舰的伤害程度；挪威和丹麦得到少数鱼雷艇。这些驱逐舰于1950年代纷纷退役，而一些鱼雷艇则在1960年代回到了德国。为了进行战后的扫雷作业，英国从1945年6月至1948年1月聘请德国水手和扫雷艇人员，组织了小型的「德国扫雷部门」，其中有前战争海军27,000名人员和300艘船只。1956年西德加入北约组织，一个新的海军组织诞生：Bundesmarine。有些如Erich Topp和奥托·克瑞奇米尔等前战争海军指挥官继续为联邦海军服务；战后不久东德的人民海军也跟著成立，1990年两德统一后，海军改名为德国海军。\n## 指挥结构与人员编制\n战争海军的指挥体系基本上与国家海军相同，希特勒是德国全军统帅，德意志国防军设有德国海军总司令部，由战争海军总司令（Oberbefehlshaber der Kriegsmarine）指挥。下辖海军参谋长指挥的海军参谋部和海战指挥部。\n德国海军还依照地区划分Marinegruppenkommando，下面再分为各地的Marineoberkommando，如北海海军最高统帅部，各辖有舰队，每支舰队各由一将官负责，并统一听从舰队司令（Flottenchef）的指挥。海军中各不同的舰种和兵种也有各统一指挥官，如战斗舰总司令、巡洋舰总司令和潜艇总司令等，另外还有海军保安部、侦查部和负责沿岸巡逻、扫雷、攻击船团与侦查任务的6支飞行中队（配有Fw 200长程轰炸机，但由空军负责培训和调度）。陆上单位除了数个海军砲兵营外，到战争后期还有少量海军步兵师（并非专职登陆作战的部队，而是海军水手所构成的陆上战斗部队）。\n## 招募与训练\n20年代时因为德国经济凋敝，不少人前来海军谋求一份工作，德国海军因而吸收大批志愿者，同时也有许多技术人员。在希特勒恢复征兵制后，标准年龄是17岁到23岁。应征者除了附上个人资料、政治信仰、教育程度外，还要求血统证明。通过基本审查后还要经过6个月的技术实习才能正式入伍，并获得一份军人通行证。招募进入海军所得最高军衔是高级士官长，并要求他们签订至少12年的服役合约，而希望晋升军官者更要服役长达25年。基本军事训练完成后，候补军官还有105天的航海训练、14个月的巡洋舰航海训练、1年的海军学院学习课程、6个月的专业技能训练和1年的舰上实战训练。战前德国海军每年招募13,000人入伍，其中只有33％能通过严格的潜艇艇员资格审查，而这其中又只有60％的人最后能进入潜艇部队中。到了1942年，海军每年征召42,000人，但潜艇部队一直有所缺额，后来还从其他军种中转调人员，经过短期训练后进入服役。潜艇部队训练起于1933年的基尔反潜学院，使用第一训练舰队的II级潜艇进行操作（U-1～U-6号），还要教授潜艇构造、技术、推进系统等课题，后来训练舰队持续扩编，直到战争结束时共有4个训练舰队。\n## 船舰武装\n### 水面舰\n#### 航空母舰\n战争海军在雷德尔的推动下，于Z计划中预计建造2艘航空母舰，然而德国海军在使用、建造航空母舰上都欠缺经验，有不少技术和设计皆从轴心盟国的日本海军所引进（主要参考赤城号的设计）。虽然德国海军发展海军航空兵非常不顺，但仍有研制数种舰载飞机，在二次大战英德海战正激烈时，英国舰载机多远不及同期德国空军军机；但由于海军水面舰的建造计划断断续续，加上与潜艇派军官和空军总司令赫尔曼·戈林的纠纷，使许多舰载机的生产改装计划皆胎死腹中。预定建造的航空母舰分别为：齐柏林伯爵号、彼得·史特拉塞号，并将配置的舰载机为战斗机（10架）：Bf 109T型或Blohm & Voss BV 155、俯冲轰炸机（20架）：Ju 87C型或E型、鱼雷轰炸机（20架）：Fi 167。之后在战争中期，德国海军还预计以其他船只改装成航空母舰，包括希佩尔海军上将级重巡洋舰的塞德利茨号（改装完后将改称威瑟河号）、欧罗巴号、波茨坦号（改装完后改称易北河号）、Gneisenau (1935)（改装完后改称亚德河号）、从法国缴获的迪格拉塞号轻巡洋舰，以及其他商船改装的水上机母舰。最后只有齐柏林伯爵号进行过下水仪式，但还是仅完成85％且无配置舰载机（主要是因为与戈林的航空兵力分配权冲突所致）。除了德国自己的船舰外，也有于义大利投降后缴获的鹫座号与Italian aircraft carrier Sparviero，但这两艘也都未建造完成。\n#### 战列舰\n德国海军原本仅保有3艘自一战遗留的旧式战列舰（德国级战列舰的石勒苏益格-荷尔斯泰因号，西里西亚号和汉诺威号），但多作为辅助舰和训练舰。在希特勒撕毁《凡尔赛条约》、签订《英德海军协定》后，开始设计允许德国建造的35,000吨级战列舰，就是后来的俾斯麦级战斗舰。俾斯麦级共有2艘，排水量实际上超过规定（40,000吨以上），分别为俾斯麦号和铁必制号。俾斯麦级是德国二战下水的唯一级别战列舰，在美国的爱荷华级和大日本帝国的大和级下水前，她们一直是世界上最大型的战列舰。航速最高可达29节，航程9000海浬（19节），配有8门380毫米的主砲、12门150毫米副砲。装甲侧舷可达320毫米、甲板最厚处也有200毫米。俾斯麦号和铁必制号分别以汉诺威号的替代舰—F舰与什列斯威格-霍尔斯坦号的替代舰—G舰之名开始建造，并分别于1940年8月和1941年2月服役。雷德尔于Z计划也拟定了多艘不同于俾斯麦级的战列舰建造计划，即H级战斗舰（兴登堡级），并以H、J、K、L等代号起工兴建，该级战斗舰的主砲口径、装甲厚度和排水量（L舰满载排水量就有98,000吨）皆很高，预定作为北海突破英国舰队的主力，但因为战争过早爆发、原物料的短缺和希特勒的反对，直到战争结束都没有一艘被制造出来。\n#### 装甲舰、战列巡洋舰和重巡洋舰\n在俾斯麦级的设计尚未出现前，德国海军因为条约的限制而设计建造了3艘德国级装甲舰，它们拥有战斗舰的火力和巡洋舰的排水量，并以电焊来减轻舰身重量、使用柴油引擎和轻装甲，配有6门280毫米主砲、8门150毫米副砲，最高航速可达26节，其火力比重巡洋舰强、航速比战斗舰快，是良好的水面破交舰。原本预计还要再建造2艘，但因为法国建造了专门应付德国级的敦刻尔克级战列舰（航速最快到32节，配有330毫米主砲），便开始设计新型主力舰，原本先设计了D级装甲舰，并预计建造2艘，但后来被沙恩霍斯特级所取代。沙恩霍斯特级结合了一战来不及完成的麦肯森级和德弗林格尔级的设计，最后建造完成的共有2艘，为沙恩霍斯特号和格奈森瑙号，分别于1938年5月和1939年1月服役。其最高航速可达33节，装甲则超过战斗巡洋舰、火力则与战斗巡洋舰相同，配有9门280毫米主砲（原预定要换成380毫米的火砲，但因战争过早来临而取消）、12门150毫米的副砲，可以说是德国级装甲舰的强化型，同时也有舰种划分的争议，介于战斗舰和战斗巡洋舰之间；德国海军之后还发展出O级战斗巡洋舰和P级装甲舰，并预定在Z计划中建造，但这2种级别没有一艘完成。除了以上主力舰外，因为《英德海军协定》允许德国拥有更多军舰，德国海军也开始规划了重巡洋舰的建造，建造了2艘希佩尔海军上将级（之后又扩增到5艘），拥有8门203毫米主砲、12门105毫米副砲，并拥有颇高的发砲速度和厚重的装甲，但其引擎不稳定、容易故障。\n#### 轻巡洋舰、驱逐舰\n德国海军在国家海军时期第一艘新建造中型军舰就是轻巡洋舰恩登号，其他还有2种级别—柯尼斯堡级（又称K级）和莱比锡级。恩登号的设计与一次大战的形式极为接近，配有8门150毫米砲（其中有4门位于舰身中线），主要用于训练和布雷等次要任务。柯尼斯堡级则为恩登号更进一步的设计，火力加大到200毫米，并大幅提升了续航力；该级的3艘同型舰有2艘即在战争前期就沉没。而最后的莱比锡级则是柯尼斯堡级的改良版，武装和防护能力相同，但续航力和引擎出力进行了改良。1939年还有要建造6艘新型的M级轻巡洋舰，但被取消。驱逐舰方面，因为条约的建造限制，德国以加大吨位强化其战力的做法比其他盟军都早，尽管二战中德国的驱逐舰现代化程度远高过其他国家，但本身仍具有一些问题，如：在恶劣或潮湿的天气气候中，高压蒸汽涡轮引擎不稳定且续航力极短等。虽然在后期改善不少，但随著入侵挪威的重创以及希特勒决定将德国海军的建军核心移往U艇部队后水面舰的地位就没有多大影响。在二战爆发后，大多数驱逐舰部队投入英国海岸附近的通商航道布雷任务和为德国船团护航，其后也未建造新舰。德国驱逐舰由建造年作为级别名称，如1934年级，到了1936年级后船名全部以Z开头，后面加上数字编号命名。此外在Z计划中曾预计建造一种大型的驱逐舰（也算是轻巡洋舰），为远洋侦察级轻巡洋舰，以攻击商船和侦查为主要任务，但没有一艘建造完成。\n#### 鱼雷艇、S艇、伪装巡洋舰\n德国在一战战后建造新式驱逐舰前，就已有数量众多的鱼雷艇，它们拥有一定的战斗能力，并在原本就为数不多的水面舰队里担任了辅助性的角色，如在北海布雷和拦截敦刻尔克撤退的船只、威瑟堡作战和海峡冲刺作战。德国从威玛共和国时期到二战结束前后共建造51艘鱼雷艇，主要是国家海军时期的狼级和Möwe (1926)，以及于30年代中后期开始建造的现代化Torpedoboot 1935，到战争结束时全部仅剩12艘幸存，有些甚至服役到1950年代中期。德国还拥有大型鱼雷艇—S艇，在战争中先后担任了扫雷、布雷、护航和攻击的任务，这些S艇长期活越于英吉利海峡与近海的袭击作战，德国于战争期间总投入249艘S艇，共有157艘被击沉或自沉，剩余92艘分给战胜国。在二战中共有9艘德国轻型商船被改装成伪装巡洋舰，用来进行破交战，拥有极佳的续航能力，与一战英国的反潜改装商船—Q-ship相同，在外形上与商船无异但拥有强大的火力，拥有150毫米舰砲、鱼雷发射管、水雷和侦察机，善于伪装成其他中立国的船只、放出假信号干扰敌人。1940年到1941年，于大西洋、印度洋、澳洲南部海域和南太平洋攻击商船。从1940年3月开始至战争结束，这些船舰共击沉了近150艘各式船只（商船、渔船、油轮和少量帆船）。\n### 潜艇（U艇）\n由于船舶建设工程局的研究，德国潜艇并未落后国际，同时也在该机关中设计了二战爆发后的主力潜艇。主要使用的有II级、VII级和IX级潜艇，另外还有数量不多的I级、X级（布雷用）、XIV级（补给用）、XXI级和XXIII级。II型潜艇是由一战的UB型潜艇改良而来，原设计目的为训练舰，但在大战爆发潜艇数量不够时也被赋予作战任务。VII级潜艇为整场战争中德国潜艇部队的主力，尤其是VII级C型自1941年后的生产一直没停过。IX级潜艇为I级潜艇改良而来，适合远洋长期作战，作战范围可到太平洋，每艘IX级B型击沉吨位数都达到了10万吨。另外在战争后期，德国开发了绝气推进的German Type XVII submarine，还有通气呼吸管和新型引擎的XXI级和XXIII级，以往潜艇水下航速都不过10节，但XXI级和XVII级则分别为17节和25节，且可以以12节到14节航速潜航10小时，能有效对抗盟军的海上巡逻机。战后它们成为现代潜艇设计的原型，特别是苏联的W级潜艇。德国在整场战争中投入了1162艘各种类型的潜艇、以各种形式沉没者共有785艘，还有156艘向盟军投降。水面舰艇共击沉246艘潜艇、岸基飞机击沉245艘、舰载机击沉43艘、飞机和船舰合作击沉50艘、盟军潜艇也击沉了21艘。共有32,000名潜艇人员阵亡。德国在战争期间还有开发出数种袖珍潜艇，其中有像Neger (Torpedo)者，制造了200多艘于战争中使用。战争里德国潜艇除了执行攻击商船的任务外，也会担任运输和与日本交换物资的船只工作。另外还有曾研究能够发射V-2火箭的Rocket U-boat计划，但没有完成。\n### 鱼雷\n第一次世界大战战败后，由于船舶建设工程局引进国外技术，使德国的鱼雷科技并未停止发展。然而在战争初期，德国海军的鱼雷性能极差，常有引信失效、发射航道偏移、发射后会下潜等问题。邓尼兹对鱼雷表现写道：「连这些静止的船只都打不中，这简直根本不可能的。我们潜艇部队发现触发引信和磁引信都不能正常工作。实际上，潜艇等于没有任何的武器。……鱼雷已在很大程度上不适应前线作战，这是自战争爆发以来影响潜艇部队斗志的最大问题，也严重削减了他们的战果。在发射出去的鱼雷中至少有25％失效，而其中又有40％是鱼雷本身的问题。」在1940年初德军在威瑟堡行动中使用的G7e torpedo还被称作「窝囊的鱼雷」，也因此邓尼兹成立「鱼雷调查会」进行改善，由奥斯卡·库末兹和技术专家调查其失灵原因，后来发现磁引信的失灵可能是因为挪威地区地球磁场的关系或挪威铁矿造成的、航行异常的问题则是因为控制鱼雷鳍片的阀门受到潜艇潜浮的压力变化所致。邓尼兹后来命令所有鱼雷换下磁引信，改用触发引信。而其拥有的下沉问题，导致对吃水浅的敌船无法造成伤害，包括潜艇天敌—驱逐舰。邓尼兹后来命令潜艇部队在北纬62度以北作战的潜艇要混用磁引信和触发引信，舰首4个鱼雷发射管有3枚是触发引信、1枚磁引信，攻击吃水深船舰只使用触发引信、攻击吃水浅者则使用2枚鱼雷，两种各一，为避免磁引信鱼雷提早爆炸引爆触发引信鱼雷，要相隔8秒再射第2枚。然而触发引信也有问题存在，直到1940年6月鱼雷问题才全被解决，但引爆威力被大幅减小，以往1枚鱼雷所能造成的伤害变得需要2枚才能完成，加速了潜艇部队鱼雷的消耗量。后来德国海军又相继研究数款鱼雷，如追踪声音的导引鱼雷—Zaunkönig (Torpedo)，其他还有飞机、袖珍潜艇和鱼雷快艇等特定载具专用的鱼雷被开发出来。G7e鱼雷后也成了美国海军Mark 18 torpedo的设计基础。\n## 疏忽与失败\n### 过少的战争资源和错误的应用方式\n战争海军在二战中的失败是由于许多不同的因素，包括世界大战爆发过早，使得错估开战时间的雷德尔Z计划近乎停摆，而邓尼兹早已预料战事的到来并加速推动潜艇的生产时，海军的巨大资源已花费在造船厂建造各艘战舰，因此建造快的潜艇与建造慢的水面舰队德国海军皆未拥有；同时，德国海军战略因为过度受到魏格纳「交通战」理论影响，使得原本数量就已经很少的水面舰队在战争前期所分配到的任务为分开攻击商船，其效率非常低，也未曾考虑过集中施行存在舰队的应用，其单舰突击的作战方式也就导致了俾斯麦号的沉没；此外，德国海军军官高估了分散攻击的效力，也低估英国护航系统的弹性与军事实力。德国海军与分配战争资源的戈林也有著冲突，此人又身兼空军总司令一职，为德国海军在海空作战与航空母舰的开发上有极为不良的影响。\n### 武器与装备上的限制\n在大西洋海战逐渐由潜艇主导的同时，盟军无论是在护航体制还是武器装备上都在不断演进，包括无线电测位网、新型深水炸弹、反潜迫击砲、新型雷达、探照灯、高频率测向仪和支援群的应用。支援群弥补英国早期护航兵力不足，在驱赶德国潜艇后往往不能将其击沉就回到船团的情况，反而有余力击沉德国潜艇。同时支援群中的护航航空母舰因为配有长程飞机，可弥补陆基飞机所不及的「空隙处」，使续航力不长的潜艇浮出水面时不断受袭，且盟军压倒性的生产力更将此问题放大。战争期间德国潜艇在对盟军的科技优势上也未作到实质的反制，潜艇在水面航行速度仍比水下来的快、德军设计用来躲避雷达的Metox、Naxos radar detector也无法应付盟军的搜索手段、早期德军设计潜艇用加强舰砲的错误方式来反制盟国空军、后期开发的导引鱼雷也被Foxer所破解，德军最优秀的潜艇科技—通气管式潜艇的开发与服役过晚、还有缺乏海军航空兵与航空母舰等。邓尼兹直到1943年战局逆转时才开始命令属下研制新型武器，未即时争取到科技优势。\n### 并未取得决定性胜利\n纵使德国海军在整场战争中多是扮演牵制和辅助性的角色，它也错过了几次少有的决定性战役，如在敦刻尔克战役中剿灭盟军部队或是在其撤退途中即时组织进行对英登陆作战。潜艇在战争初期也一直未有足够的数量实行狼群战术，特别是在英国还在为护航制度犹豫且空军飞机数量不足之时，之后又因为分散到各不同的战场而未有集中使用，例如像印度洋、太平洋和非洲大陆东岸等对战略全局影响不大的地方。其他还有初期鱼雷问题、恩尼格玛密码机的破解，导致吨位战的差距增大，没有即时弥补，而盟军生产力不断地上升，这个差距也逐渐增加。\n## 参考书目\n中文书\n外文书\n延伸阅读", "# 纳粹德国海军\n\n1935年至1946年的德国海军\n\n纳粹德国海军（德语：Kriegsmarine，意为战争海军）是指在1935年至1946年的德国海军。战争海军取代了第一次世界大战的德意志帝国海军和魏玛共和国的国家海军，为德国国防军中的海军力量。## 建立历史\n\n1900年代，德意志帝国为赶上最后一波的殖民浪潮和阿尔弗雷德·冯·提尔皮茨（Alfred von Tirpitz）对海军扩张的提倡，而与国际列强展开建造无畏舰的军备竞赛，并建立了一支世界上规模数一数二的舰队。第一次世界大战爆发后，德国水面舰队—公海舰队不仅多次与英国皇家海军交战，还以潜艇部队发起无限制潜艇战，击沉多艘协约国船只。然而在日德兰海战后，德国海军虽获得战术上的胜利，却被封锁于港湾中而无法行动。公海舰队司令的莱因哈特·舍尔（Reinhard Scheer）上将无法让舰队出击，取得比潜艇部队更高的战果，而其水兵士气日以降低，最后引发了基尔港水兵叛变的德国革命。1918年11月11日，德国投降。根据停战协定，公海舰队需驶入英国斯卡帕湾扣押，然而舰队却在1919年6月21日被德国海军路德维克·冯·罗伊特（Ludwig von Reuter）中将暗中计划的彩虹行动集体自沉，目的是防止船只被战胜国所瓜分。协约国对此行动极为不满，以德国违反协定为由，将其几近全部有登记的船舶没收、拆走码头设备、各大造船厂机具相继被解体，并在往后的条约和限制中对德国海军更加严格。在彩虹行动和5艘现代化的轻巡洋舰作为战争赔偿后，德国海军仅剩下8艘旧型无畏舰（拿骚级，Nassau class battleship）和赫尔戈兰级、32艘驱逐舰和鱼雷艇，数量少、性能也过时，仅能做海防一用。1921年1月1日，依照《凡尔赛条约》规定，德国成立了新的国家海军，作为魏玛共和国的海军力量。\n《凡尔赛条约》严格限制了德国海军的规模与实力，德国只能拥有15,000名的海军人员，规定服役长达25年；船舰仅能保有6艘排水量10,000吨以下的旧式战列舰、6艘巡洋舰、12艘驱逐舰、12艘鱼雷艇以及额外规定禁止拥有军用飞机、航空母舰和潜艇。虽然协约国允许替换舰龄达20年的战列舰与巡洋舰，但限制战列舰吨位不可超过10,000吨、不得装有口径超过11吋的舰炮，使其功能仅近乎重巡洋舰；而巡洋舰的替换则规定排水量6000吨，能配装的最大火炮口径仅有6吋；驱逐舰则为800吨、鱼雷艇为200吨；这样的缩编使得留下的海军人员都是优秀份子，往后也都成了战争海军中重要的领导人物。\n德国潜艇曾在一战取得辉煌战绩，然而在《凡尔赛条约》禁止建造潜艇和协约国监管后，各大船厂虽有世界领先的潜艇技术却苦无客户，这时日本与阿根廷联系了德国数个造船厂，希望购买设计图与转授技术以建立本国潜艇部队。这两个规模庞大的生意使得德国串连了各大造船厂和企业，由克虏伯发起，联合成立了一家空壳公司——船舶建设工程局（NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw），总部设于荷兰海牙，以躲避凡尔赛条约的监督。船舶建设工程局存在目的除了为整合各造船厂技术和资源、联合接订单外，也要和国际潜艇技术接轨，使德国不至于落后。但到了1925年，船舶建设工程局经营不善，在面临倒闭的情况下，德国海军私下与其公司人员联系。德国海军也透过一个名为“结算咨询公司”的空壳企业加入了船舶建设工程局的投资，并在之后注资了100万马克，成为该公司最大股东，还额外许诺每年补贴12万马克，军方要求该公司为德国重建潜艇部队保有新技术和设计，原本为国内造船业解决财政问题的船舶建设工程局因此转为德国海军专门的研究机构。除了船舶建设工程局外，海军还接触了其他民间企业，同时进行水雷、鱼雷磁触发引信和舰载机液压弹射器的研究。\n当时海军内部的情况则是，国家海军首任海军总司令——保罗·贝恩克上将打算在严格限制和经费极为有限的情况下重建一支现代化的海军，其目标为保护近海，由于舰只过于老旧，必须大量汰换。他下令组建2支战队：北海舰队和波罗的海舰队，用来控制波罗的海海口，以防法国与波兰联手对付德国。1925年，德国战后建造的第一艘轻巡洋舰——恩登号（German cruiser Emden）下水，该舰完全照条约要求建造，其后又相继建造了新式的海鸥级鱼雷艇和狼级鱼雷艇（Raubtier-Klasse），为战后德国海军赶上国际技术的第一批新舰队。1924年，贝恩克的职位被汉斯·曾克尔上将所取代，曾克尔任内最后一年正值第一批旧式战舰达到合约要求，允许汰换的时候。这时军方内对于以何种军舰来取代旧舰有2种不同的意见，是建造远洋用重巡洋舰还是近海防御的铁甲舰？最后以条约的要求设计了一款新式的舰种——装甲舰，主要特征为战列舰等级的火力、航速快和轻装甲。然而在装甲舰首舰德意志号于1931年下水前，魏玛共和国国会议员注意到了结算咨询公司的存在，反对重新武装的议员使议会下令调查，结果幕后的各研究机关，以及同意资助的海军高层人员一一被揪出，包括曾克尔上将，也因此下台退役，重建海军的工作受到了打击。但新上任的海军总司令埃里希·雷德尔上将很快的控制了混乱的局面，他亲自前去会见政府成员，说服海军重建之必要性，政府态度因而从不满转为支持。雷德尔还将同时期的研究多加了货船改装为伪装巡洋舰和将渔船改装为扫雷艇（Minesweeper）的计划，还规划了一个平民飞行训练计划，为往后要建立的海军航空兵做准备。船舶建设工程局也接连接获土耳其、芬兰、西班牙和苏联的潜艇订单，潜艇部队因而获得大量宝贵的第一手性能和大规模生产技术资料。1933年10月，德国海军秘密在基尔设立一间标明“反潜防御学校”的军校，实际上在训练潜艇舰员。\n1933年1月，纳粹党成为德国执政党，希特勒支持雷德尔重组海军舰队，并多次保证会极力避免与英国的战争以争取时间。1935年3月16日，希特勒正式宣布单方面废止《凡尔赛条约》，并将国家海军被改名为战争海军。英国对于德国重整军备的动作颇为担忧，为保持两国较不紧张的关系，于1935年6月18日与德国签订了《英德海军协定》，该协定缓和了英国国内对另一场海军军备竞赛的担忧，但德国受益更多：德国可以装备潜艇，并能建立规模为英国皇家海军35%总吨位的舰队，总吨位约40万吨，其中战斗舰总排水量为18万，这也限制了新建造的4艘战列舰，每艘排水量皆不能超过45,000吨；而潜艇部队则为英国潜艇的45%。当时英国皇家海军拥有12艘战列舰、3艘战列巡洋舰、8艘航空母舰、54艘巡洋舰和169艘驱逐舰，认为即使德国违反此协定，也有足够余力对付德国。6月29日，在条约签完仅11天，第一艘新潜艇U-1型潜艇（German submarine U-1，1935）就在基尔军港下水服役。虽然德国潜艇已可正常装备，但希特勒不想暴露其战争野心，未批准大规模的潜艇生产计划，并表示希望一切问题借由外交手段解决，重整军备不过是将德国变回一个“正常”的国家，对英国释出没有要进行军备竞赛的善意与争取国际的同情。\n1937年11月5日，希特勒召集军官宣布可能必须动用武力来解决一些领土问题，包括奥地利、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰。继德奥合并和慕尼黑会议后，希特勒于1938年9月开始要求海军作战部拟定对英国的战争，即是后来的“Z计划”，并于1939年1月27日被希特勒所批准执行，并给予优先于其他军备的资源。Z计划是以英国皇家海军为主、法国海军为副假想敌为对象，设计的6年大型水面舰队建造计划。意在英国尚未做好战争准备之前，建立起一支能与其匹敌的舰队，并以大规模的舰队进行战略性的部署作战。此计划规模非常庞大，若如期完成，德国海军将拥有能与皇家海军相搏的实力。\n\n## 作战思想\n\n一战到二战的海军思想\nZ计划的结构是由德国海军两种的战略思想集结改良而成。最初德意志帝国海军是一支由陆军将领担任指挥的小型舰队，陆军的战略与战术上也影响海军甚剧，其后德国海军之父提尔皮茨过去主张“风险理论”与引诱敌人部分兵力来进行舰队决战的想法，但其因为德国地理位置的致命缺陷，导致一战中期日德兰海战爆发、与英国整支大舰队交火后，公海舰队被封锁，因为提尔皮茨个人的影响力甚剧，德国海军直到魏玛共和时期仍有保持其战略观点。1926年，沃夫冈·魏格纳（Wolfgang Wegener）海军中将首次提出了地缘战略和存在舰队的应用理论，并对海军内部提出德国对英国的地理劣势重要性、战略目标的检讨，认为提尔皮茨在海战中过于注重消灭敌人舰队的有生力量，而没有将其作以更灵活的应用，专注进行破交战。德国在地理位置上一直处于不利位置，英国的海上生命线位于大西洋西侧，而德国附近的海域仅有北海和波罗的海，德国舰队在试图穿越抵达至大西洋前就会遭到英国其近于本土的舰队攻击，且能有效的支援，反之德国则无。魏格纳虽提倡控制海上交通线和在地缘战略上有其着眼点，却过度轻视了英德两国的舰队质与量上的差距，认为地理优势可以完全弥补一切。即使如此，因为一次大战提尔皮茨理论的失败，德国海军转而认为魏格纳的“交通控制”理论才是其海军发展的进取核心，并在军中刺激许多年轻军官的其相关战略研究，但也受到保守军官的批评。魏格纳提出新海军思想的同时，德国海军正于纳粹党统治并开始规划重建舰队的工作，正需要一个军事学说来决定路线，新海军思想中以雨果·冯·瓦德叶-哈兹的《明日的海战》（Naval Warfare of Tomorrow）论文对其观点的叙述最为完整与极端，认为舰队间的战斗已过时，将来海战的发展会转为对海上贸易线商船的攻防战，而1920年代的德国海军也接受了此思想。\n水面舰队与潜艇的联合作战\n雷德尔是反对魏格纳理论的保守军官之一，在担任海军总司令期间亦曾查禁其思想，然而在他所提出的Z计划就有其交通战的想法，同时也结合以优势兵力进行巡洋舰决战的提尔皮茨主张。雷德尔认为北海能以一支战斗舰队来突破英军的封锁，同时派出多艘巡洋舰、潜艇进入大西洋和其他英国通航线进行交通战，迫使英国为保护船团而大量采用护航船团，分散皇家海军的实力，进而相继消灭护航舰和本土舰队。这样的战略不但能造成英国大量物资的损失，也能牵制敌人相当可观的军力，而潜艇在一战中的失败被认为是因为单艘作战能力不足，才会被已分散的护航兵力所击败，若结合水面舰队和潜艇就能解决此问题，同时潜艇的存在更可限制船团的队形，让水面舰队的攻击更为容易。也因此，除了早期制造的3艘德意志级装甲舰，Z计划仍要继续建造这种以商船和脆弱的护航舰为主要攻击对象、而非主力战列舰的军舰。\n除了雷德尔的Z计划舰队外，德国海军中有另一派不同的主张，就是卡尔·邓尼茨上校的潜艇战斗群理论，也是形成日后的狼群战术核心。邓尼兹认为只要持续进行“吨位战”，让英国建造新船只的速度低于被击沉的速度，就能减少英国海上通航线运回本土的物资，包括战争工业所需要的一切原物料和人民所需的粮食，进而对德国投降。邓尼茨曾在一战中指挥过潜艇，根据经验，他认为若要攻击英国的护航船团，唯一的方法就是将潜艇集中并分为多个“群”，进行严密的战术控制和协同战斗。邓尼茨在《英德海军协定》签下后，提出了大型的潜艇建造计划，主张将全部用于建造德国水面舰队的资源用来制造潜艇，其中以制造大量机动力强、适合远洋作战的中型潜艇（即指VII级潜艇）最为重要，至少要300艘，其中100艘在海上巡弋、100艘在往返基地与作战海域、100艘在基地修整待命，并保持与其他类型潜艇3比1的比例。起初他的计划不被海军总部所接受，海军总部认为未来潜艇仍会是单独作战的型态，比较适合建造拥有较大口径舰炮和长续航力的大型潜艇（即指I级潜艇），即将潜艇用于类似巡洋舰的功能。这个争论直到1939年夏季多次对英国护航船团攻击的演习后，邓尼兹才说服了海军总部。然而即使已经说服了雷德尔和希特勒，德国仍没有将潜艇的生产放在第一位，也因此大战爆发后狼群战术迟迟无法实行。\n\n##

作战历史\n\n起初德国海军战果颇多，击沉不少同盟国商船，但因为希特勒对水面舰队始终印象不佳，认为其建造缓慢且战果小；而潜艇部队建造速度快，还在法国陷落而取得西部港口后，对英国发动大规模的潜艇战中取得一系列丰硕的战果。德国海军随着战事的进行，开始将战力中心自水面舰移往潜艇部队的“吨位战”，而前者逐渐转为存在舰队的功能。德国海军的潜艇数量在战争爆发时是当时世界海军列强中最少者，但因为潜艇总司令卡尔·邓尼茨以狼群战术、先进的通信制度和战略规划而取得所有交战国潜艇部队里最大的战绩。到了1943年，德国潜艇在大西洋越来越力不从心，盟军不但破解了密码机和开发多种先进反潜武器，如更先进的声纳、雷达、深水炸弹，还投入了大量护卫航空母舰和反潜战斗群进行护航；同年5月，德国潜艇因为损失过高而放弃了狼群战术，改采单舰巡弋。战争末期，德国海军虽研制了先进的通气管式潜艇，如XXI级潜艇和XXIII级（German Type XXIII submarine），并投入使用直到战争结束，但仍无法扭转战败的结果。\n\n### 初期\n\n1939年8月19日德国海军总司令埃里希·雷德尔对海军下达战争动员令，将所有海军舰艇进入至备战状态，雷德尔认为动员令不久即会解除，英法两国会妥协但泽的领土纷争，但在9月1日德国入侵波兰（其中战争海军参与了西盘半岛战役和炮轰但泽湾）后2天，两国对德宣战。当雷德尔听到宣战消息时，他说道：“现在，水面舰队能做的只有一件事，表现出他们懂得如何英勇赴死。”在Z计划才刚起工的情况下，德国海军此时能出战的只有2艘战列巡洋舰、3艘装甲舰、2艘重巡洋舰、6艘轻巡洋舰和共34艘的驱逐舰和鱼雷艇，邓尼茨在日后说道：“早在战争爆发时，我们就被打败了，因为德国并没有在海上做好万全准备。”德国最高统帅部迅速拟定了作战计划，雷德尔以早就派遣于海外的2艘装甲舰发起攻势，开始攻击盟军船只；而邓尼茨则赶紧派遣潜艇进入大西洋，德国官方宣布“无论是否悬挂中立国之旗帜都将会攻击”，此时潜艇数量少以及希特勒下令潜艇必须遵守《捕获法则》行事而难以有重大战绩，邓尼茨还是希望在英国启用护航制度前尽可能多击沉一些船只。9月3日，驶往美国的英国客轮雅典娜号（SS Athenia）因为意外而被U-30（German submarine U-30，1936）潜艇击沉，成为开战后第一艘被德国海军击沉的船只，英国认为德国已启用无限制潜艇战的作战模式，于是以护航制度来因应。英国在9月份被击沉了43艘船，但开始护航后就只被击沉1艘。由于英国已启用护航制度，邓尼茨想进行狼群战术来因应，但潜艇数量太少，因而在第一次的集结过程中被击沉3艘。9月30日，在邓尼茨的说服下，希特勒下令潜艇部队不必遵守《捕获法则》而使得潜艇的猎杀战果大有上升，但数量仍少。英国方面对护航制度存有歧见，一方认为它是一种防守而无实际成效，应额外组建猎杀潜艇的舰队；另一方又认为不该浪费护航兵力，导致其制度没有贯彻实施。德国水面舰队则在拉普拉塔河口海战中损失了斯比上将号，其后又有2艘轻巡洋舰被英军潜艇重创，于港中修补，雷德尔派遣了数艘伪装巡洋舰于海外攻击商船，其他舰只则留在军港中。\n虽然陆上西线一直维持假战状态，但到了1940年因为一次大战英国曾利用挪威领海封锁德国舰队，以及希特勒担心其阻断瑞典铁矿砂的运输和维德孔·吉斯林的游说，德军于4月9日发动威瑟堡行动进攻挪威与丹麦，海军同陆空军协同作战，德国虽然最后成功占领各目标，但海军表现颇糟，损失了1艘重巡洋舰、2艘轻巡洋舰、10艘驱逐舰和4艘潜艇，同时也因为鱼雷性能问题导致潜艇攻击战果少、艇员士气低落。威瑟堡行动的结果对于德国海军战略拥有决定性的影响，使德国突破英国的海上封锁、获得了从日德兰至北角的所有港口。1940年5月，德军发起春季攻势占领法国，英国远征军撤退至本土，之后意大利对英法宣战。希特勒登陆英国的海狮计划因德国海军在挪威的损失、替登陆部队护航得交由空军，之后因为不列颠空战失败而无限期的推延，雷德尔因此而继续派遣军舰前往大西洋攻击商船。\n第一段美好时光\n法国投降为德国攻击英国海上通航线带来了极为便利的条件，德国潜艇不必再从威廉港出发，耗费油料和一星期的航行时间才能进入大西洋，能够从法国港口更有效的触及英国海上生命线，大西洋上的潜艇活动数量也因此增加了25%。由于法国沦陷，德国即将进攻英国本土，皇家海军舰队多调回待命，海上护航兵力变得相当薄弱，在1940年6月和7月，每一支船团仅配有一艘军舰护航，而护航舰与岸基飞机的反潜设备只能对付水下目标而不能对在水面攻击商船的潜艇，再加上英国因为担心受到空中德国军机的攻击而要求所有商船改以爱尔兰往苏格兰的北海峡航道航行，导致航线拥挤，德国潜艇得以在1940年7月至12月于获得重大战果，艇长称其为“第一段美好时光（First Happy Time）”，光德国潜艇就击沉了278艘商船，共1,492,054总吨数的物资。大西洋运输物资的损失直到1940年9月2日美国的富兰克林·D·罗斯福总统透过《基地驱逐舰协定》（Destroyers for Bases Agreement）提供了50艘驱逐舰给英国，情况才稍有改善。这段时间里虽然德国潜艇战果丰硕，但因为潜艇数量太少，难以发起狼群战术，虽然邓尼茨曾利用意大利的潜艇试图贯彻此战术，但因为人员训练和作战方式等问题而作罢；同时也因为缺乏长程侦察机而无法充分利用这段时间获得更大的战果。\n俾斯麦号沉没\n德国水面舰队于1940年10月派出数艘装甲舰、重巡洋舰和伪装巡洋舰由北海进入大西洋攻击商船，在海上大有斩获，迫使英国作好战斗以迎击。1941年5月18日，德国海军发起莱茵演习行动（Operation Rheinübung），企图组织舰队夺得北大西洋的制海权并以刚刚开始服役的俾斯麦号战列舰吸引英国的主力舰，使其他德舰得以攻击缺乏护航战列舰的商船。此计划曾遭舰队司令刚瑟·力长斯（Günther Lütjens）的反对，他指出将此作战延到两艘战列巡洋舰（指的是沙恩霍斯特号和格奈森瑙号，它们曾在4月上旬受创，进入布雷斯特翻修，而皇家海军又于此港外布下多处雷区，使得出勤时间一延再延）做好准备再进行，但遭雷德尔驳回，他指出若是到夏季才开始执行将会失去天候和昼短夜长这两个有利条件；更重要的是，希特勒已在准备巴巴罗萨作战，陆军和空军的需求将为最优先，若不在海上取得惊人胜利，难使希特勒继续支持海军舰队。之后，在5月24日爆发了丹麦海峡海战，俾斯麦号和欧根亲王号击沉皇家海军的旧舰胡德号战列巡洋舰、重创威尔士亲王号战列舰，而在3天后，皇家海军派遣了大量军舰前往、搜索拦截俾斯麦号，并将其击沉。莱茵演习行动以德国海军的失败告终，使得希特勒对大型水面舰的兴致降至谷底，成了水面舰队和雷德尔的转折点，也显示皇家海军已开始集结舰队反击。到了11月，皇家海军也消灭了所有在外巡弋的德国伪装巡洋舰。\n英国反击与苏、美参战\n德国潜艇部队的战绩于1940年10月达到最高峰，也开始使用狼群编队，但其后因为冬季的到来略有下降。英国则开始组织反击，重组了护航制度、将西航道司令部由普利茅斯改至利物浦、更换指挥官和进行更严谨的海空军合作，英国透过政府密码研究协会，对德国潜艇的电文和通信进行拦截，判断其出没位置，并向海军部提供适合的航线与护航舰艇资讯，此举大大改进了护航的效率。由于英军的反潜技术有了相当的经验，在1941年3月击沉了不少潜艇（英国每损失五艘商船就击沉一艘德国潜艇），其中还损失了3名王牌艇长。邓尼茨此时拥有的潜艇数量仍仅有27艘，他决定派遣它们前往更西边的航道，护航战列舰和岸基飞机所不及处。1941年5月，德国潜艇U-101被盟军所俘虏，并获得一台通信用的恩尼格玛密码机，同时也改善了测向仪技术、雷达系统。\n美国方面，美国总统罗斯福对德国潜艇态度越来越强硬，1939年9月23日美国就发表《巴拿马宣言》，划分了一个海上中立“安全区”，提供美国军舰保护该海域的船只，其后又有《驱逐舰协定》和《租借法案》、同意英国军舰于美国造船厂检修、还将其安全区向东延长，到了6月美国还驻军于冰岛，也使得德国与美国海军的关系越来越紧张。1941年6月，英国破解了恩尼格玛密码，为反潜和护航作战提供了重要的帮助，但因为邓尼兹察觉到有异，下令将保密制度升级，英国的密码优势并未维持太久，反而被德国破解了英国海军部的密码。6月22日，希特勒进攻苏联，并调拨了相当的资源在对苏战争上，且要求邓尼茨不得攻击美国船舰以免其参战，英国则宣布将会支援苏联一切作战物资，并透过北冰洋航线送达。12月7日，日本攻击美国夏威夷的珍珠港基地，美国因此对日宣战，德国也在12月11日对美国宣战，战场范围因而扩大了。\n第二段美好时光\n邓尼兹在1942年年底只有90艘潜艇，他认为要对美国发起攻势，在最短时间内击沉大量物资（每月810,000吨），以免其造船速度和反潜准备的增加导致大西洋海战德国失败。然而德国最高统帅部因为北非和马耳他战事告紧，一直要求邓尼茨挪出兵力前往地中海和直布罗陀海域，邓尼兹认为那是无谓的浪费。他策划了以美国船只为主要目标的击鼓行动（Operation Drumbeat），由于美国没有使用护航制度而不使用狼群战术。美国因为太平洋战争而调移了许多原本可用来攻击潜艇的军舰，《租借法案》也转移不少驱逐舰给了英国，使得美国本土海域缺乏防御，美国海军总司令恩斯特·金恩上将认为在护航船舰不足的情况下建立护航船团没有意义，只有在拥有必要资源时才组建。德国潜艇于1942年1月至8月在美国东岸大有斩获，并称其为“第二段美好时光（Second Happy Time）”。\n美国东海岸负责反潜作战的大西洋舰队所组建出的反潜艇队也多为不适合此作战的船只且缺乏训练，而从美国陆军航空队征调用来作为反潜机的B-17和B-24也因为陆海军指挥权和从轰炸机转为反潜机不适应而有各个问题。德国潜艇则因为每天截获许多盟军商船所发出的无线电讯号而大肆攻击船团，美国则在反潜作战上缺乏搜索与追击的实战经验，海空力量也没有协同，深水炸弹等武器性能也低落。一直到5月，美国海军才开始了护航制度并对反潜制度加以改进。邓尼茨因为美国东海岸防御能力逐渐增强，他开始将潜艇派到防御松散的墨西哥湾和北大西洋等其他海域以维持吨位战计算所需达到的每月击沉数。1942年夏，越来越多德国潜艇下水服役，邓尼茨因而恢复启用狼群战术，还有派遣潜艇运输秘密渗透破坏单位进入美国。\n\n### 战略转移\n\n德国战略上因为援苏船队的存在与英国多次派出突击队登陆挪威进行破坏行动，使希特勒认为其试图在斯堪的纳维亚半岛登陆反攻，他对此说道：“挪威是这场战争的‘命运之地’”，要求“每一艘可动用的船舰都要部署于挪威。”，希特勒尤其要求从位在法国的主力舰穿越英吉利海峡，协防挪威，海军作战部便拟定赛博勒司行动（Operation Cerberus），成功移防了3艘主力舰和6艘驱逐舰，此外还向邓尼茨征调潜艇。邓尼茨认为此举使得大西洋海战原本就已显不够的潜艇兵力更加不足，但仍派遣了20艘潜艇。同时，主力舰转往挪威也象征了德国海军放弃了远洋作战。1942年，驻防挪威的德国海军舰队有5艘主力舰和10艘潜艇，其中对盟军战略部署最大的就是提尔皮茨号战列舰。\n1942年3月14日，希特勒下令将北极船团定为与俄国战役相关的重要战略目标，要求将其彻底阻绝。但运往摩尔曼斯克港口的船团仅受到德国在挪威的海空军零星攻击，主要是德国燃料短缺，严重限制了舰队的作战能力，1942年4月德国海军仅能获得月需求量10%的燃料，但潜艇因为使用柴油而未受影响，成了该地区真正的攻击主力。1942年12月31日，在挪威北海爆发了巴伦支海海战，错失歼灭援苏北极船队的机会，希特勒对此结果十分不满，也成了德国水面舰命运的转折点，下令拆毁所有含驱逐舰的舰队和取消水面舰的建造，将舰上的火炮、装甲与官兵用以加强大西洋长城的防御设施，雷德尔抗辩无效后就自己请辞了，而邓尼茨则被任命为新的海军总司令。邓尼茨虽为潜艇指挥官但了解舰队存在之价值，他说服了希特勒保留了水面舰队（但停止了建造），改将海军资源都投入潜艇中。在1943年发生的北角海战（Battle of North Cape）中，皇家海军约克公爵号击沉了沙恩霍斯特号，之后大多数德国水面舰退至港口作为存在舰队，牵制皇家海军的部署。而提尔皮茨号战斗舰不断地穿梭于挪威的峡湾中，盟军认为其对援苏商船运输造成非常大的威胁，持续以各种行动试图瘫痪或击沉它，最后在1944年的问答集行动（Operation Catechism）中成功击沉，从此德国水面舰队也无对盟军实际的影响力了。\n\n### 转折\n\n和水面舰队驻于挪威的情况相比，大西洋海战逐渐进入白热化阶段，双方投入之兵力甚多，邓尼兹取得了希特勒的信任加速生产潜艇，1943年的狼群规模越来越大。德国海军参谋本部认为在1943年同盟国可建造10,800,000吨的新船（实际上是12,384,000吨），因此平均每月都应要击沉总计900,000吨的船只。在2月最后10天击沉了28艘船（183,650吨）、3月的前10天共击沉41艘船（229,949吨）、后10天又击沉了44艘船（282,009吨）。在德国潜艇大有斩获的同时，同盟国也在进步，包括改良超远程飞机和使用新式反潜装备、“利式”探照灯、刺猬炮和新型深水炸弹等，德军用来躲避盟军的雷达装置和密码机也遭破解，盟国护航船只开始大量出现护卫航空母舰，也开始从英国本土轰炸德国潜艇制造厂，反潜人员的技术也逐渐进步，潜艇更是无法应付飞机这种“不对称”的战斗兵种，盟军巨大的生产力也令护航舰艇大量增加，也开始组建了“支援群”，专配于护航船团对潜艇采取攻击。\n德国潜艇的损失开始增加，2月有14艘被击沉、3月13艘、4月12艘，但到5月22日该月的损失就有31艘。到了5月底，邓尼茨认为吨位战已经宣告失败，盟军已获得战略主导权，但他还是派出潜艇于海上游猎（单艇巡弋），9月和10月，德国潜艇仅击沉了9艘船，但却损失26艘潜艇。邓尼茨在记事本上写道：“很显然，潜艇除了对敌人的牵制作战外已毫无作为。”但他还是持续生产潜艇。邓尼茨打算使用新式潜艇继续与盟军作战，他和军备部长阿尔伯特·斯佩尔将潜艇制造厂规模扩增，把每一个零件在各个不同地方生产再送到同一处组装，大大增加了效率和抵抗盟军对船厂的轰炸。\n\n### 后期\n\n1944年，纳粹德国节节败退，苏联红军从东部直捣德国本土，同时盟军也在法国开辟了第二战场，德国海军虽然派遣潜艇拦截登陆船只却战果极小，己方还损失多艘潜艇。东部则是海军水面舰以炮火支援，帮助陆军逐渐撤退。德国东普鲁士的平民怕落入红军手中将被报复，海军组织起所有力量进行撤退，展开汉尼拔行动，成功抢救了200万平民与30万士兵。到了战争最后阶段，邓尼茨还计划动用所有潜艇进行攻势，但仍无法挽回局面，在战争最后5周内共有83艘潜艇被击沉。海军还曾组织了小规模的步兵师到前线与陆军并肩作战。1945年4月30日，希特勒自杀，根据其遗嘱任命邓尼茨为联邦大总统和国家元首。5月2日，邓尼茨在弗伦斯堡组成新政府，5月5日，邓尼兹命令所有U艇停止攻击行动及返回基地。海军总司令汉斯-格奥尔格·冯·弗里德堡于1945年5月代表战争海军签署投降书。5月8日，德国正式投降，战争海军则到1946年才正式解散。\n\n### 其他战区\n\n自从意大利于1940年6月对英法宣战，就开辟了地中海战场。从1941年9月到1944年5月，约有62艘德国潜艇穿过英国直布罗陀基地前往地中海，击沉了数艘盟军军舰和商船，德国潜艇在此主要任务是打击通往地中海英国马耳他基地的补给、支援意大利海军与掩护北非埃尔温·隆美尔的德国非洲军海上补给线，然而直到战争结束都没有一艘地中海战区的潜艇回到他们原本的基地，它们多在战斗中被击沉或是投降时凿沉。邓尼兹认为德国海军在吨位战上不应浪费数量已经算少的潜艇赴往其他战场，大西洋才是决定性战场，但他的意见没有被采纳（主要原因是雷德尔于1940年建议希特勒将主战场转往地中海）。\n除了地中海外，战争海军还派遣潜艇和伪装巡洋舰前往太平洋、西非海域和印度洋击沉盟军商船，德国潜艇在此区常停驻于日本军港，少数之后成为了日本潜艇。\n另外还有在波罗的海与黑海和苏联舰队交战，同时维持东线北方集团军的补给。\n\n### 战后\n\n战争结束后，德国海军中的雷德尔和邓尼茨于纽伦堡审判中被起诉；英国海军坚决反对起诉两人，根据纽伦堡历史学家约翰·图萨斯（John Tusas）的报告，“英国海军认为德国海军进行的是一场合法公正的战争……他们明白关于海军战争的法律是非常不严谨的，执行起来会有机可乘……”。英国法学家汉佛雷·瓦多克（Humphrey Waldock）认为：“审判德国海军会面临法律难题”，图萨斯还因此总结指控德国海军的证据是“不可靠和虚弱的”。美国海军高层也有其同感，因为他们自己也在战争中对日本发起了无限制潜艇战，且不会营救落水者，有时甚至还会攻击其救生艇上的船员。然而因为受到苏联和法国政府的坚持，以及其在纳粹德国重要的政治地位，两人仍被起诉。雷德尔因为在战争爆发之初已有高级职位（海军总司令），对以海军帮助希特勒的战争行动有其责任，三项主要罪名：“发起侵略战争”、“制订侵略计划”和“犯有战争罪行”皆起诉（危害人类罪没有起诉），但仅有制订侵略计划判决有罪（威瑟堡行动）。虽然此判决引起部分争议，雷德尔最后被判决终身监禁，然而在判决时的1946年他已有70岁高龄，故因而减刑并在1955年9月获释。对邓尼茨的审判中，第一条的“发起侵略战争”由于战争爆发之初邓尼茨仅为上校军衔而无罪；第二条的“制订侵略计划”虽然邓尼茨作为海军军官仅是听命行事，但陪审团仍判决其有罪；第三条的“犯有战争罪行”案例主要集中于拉克尼亚命令（Laconia Order），指控邓尼茨于1942年12月发布该命令，要求艇长不营救落水者，并暗示杀死幸存者。然而邓尼茨辩护律师提出多项证据作证绝无此事，且证人之言词有其漏洞，美国的太平洋总司令切斯特·威廉·尼米兹上将也给予相关资讯，纽伦堡法庭的美国大法官弗朗西斯·贝弗利·比德尔宣称：“德国人发起的潜艇战争比美国的还要公正”，并不支持邓尼茨在这项罪行上有罪，但法国与苏联法官坚持其有罪，最后宣判有罪，判处10年监禁（纽伦堡法庭中被判有罪者最短的刑期）。\n\n战争结束后，德国海军只剩下少数军舰由战胜国处置。齐柏林伯爵号被苏联当作舰艇与战机的靶船。而大部分的驱逐舰和鱼雷艇则编入盟军的舰队中，驱逐舰被瓜分，莱比锡号载满毒气被拖往北海击沉，纽伦堡号进入苏联海军服役，改为马可罗夫上将号（Admiral Makarov）；欧根亲王号则是被美国使用于十字路行动，测试水下核爆对水面船舰的伤害程度；挪威和丹麦得到少数鱼雷艇。这些驱逐舰于1950年代纷纷退役，而一些鱼雷艇则在1960年代回到了德国。为了进行战后的扫雷作业，英国从1945年6月至1948年1月聘请德国水手和扫雷艇人员，组织了小型的“德国扫雷部门”，其中有前战争海军27,000名人员和300艘船只。1956年，西德加入北约组织，一个新的海军组织诞生：联邦海军（Bundesmarine）。有些如埃里希·托普（Erich Topp）和奥托·克瑞奇米尔（Otto Kretschmer）等前战争海军指挥官继续为联邦海军服务；战后不久东德的人民海军（英语：Volksmarine）也跟着成立。1990年两德统一后，海军改名为德国海军。\n\n## 部队武装\n\n### 航空母舰\n\n战争海军在雷德尔的推动下，于Z计划中预计在马丁·路德级航母的基础上额外建造2艘航空母舰，其不少技术和设计皆从轴心盟国的日本海军所引进（主要参考大凤号的设计）。实际上，在二次大战英德海战正激烈时，英国舰载机多远不及同期德国空军军机。预定建造的航空母舰分别为：齐柏林号、彼得·斯特拉号。并将配置的舰载机为战斗机（10架）：Bf 109T型或Me 155、俯冲轰炸机（20架）：Ju 87C型或E型、鱼雷轰炸机（20架）：Fi 167。之后在战争中期，德国海军还预计以其他船只改装成航空母舰，包括希佩尔海军上将级重巡洋舰改装的塞德利茨号（German cruiser Seydlitz，改装完后将改称威瑟号）、欧洲号（SS Europa）、波斯坦号（Potsdam，改装完后改称易北河号）、从法国缴获的德·格拉斯号轻巡洋舰（De Grasse）、格奈森瑙号客轮（Gneisenau，改装完后改称宝玉号），以及其他商船改装的水上机母舰。最后只有马丁·路德号，歌德号，巴赫号，歌德巴赫号四艘形成了战斗力，却在1941年4月被英国特种部队炸沉。而齐柏林伯爵号只来得及进行下水仪式，仅完成85%且无配置舰载机（主要是因为与戈林的航空兵力分配权冲突所致）。除了德国自己的船舰外，也有于意大利投降后缴获的鹫座号与雀鹰号航空母舰（Italian aircraft carrier Sparviero），但这两艘也都未建造完成。\n主要服役有：德·格拉斯号（未完成，二战后以防空巡洋舰方式归还于法国），塞德利兹号（希佩尔海军上将号第五艘舰），齐柏林伯爵号（未完成），欧罗巴号（由欧罗巴号游轮改建，未完成），马丁·路德级装甲航母（一级四艘，马丁·路德号，歌德号，巴赫号，歌德巴赫号，于1941年4月被英国特种部队炸沉。）\n\n### 战列舰\n\n主力舰\n德国海军原本仅保有2艘自一战遗留的旧式战斗舰（德意志级战列舰的什利兹威格-荷尔斯泰因号和汉诺威号），但多作为辅助舰和训练舰。在希特勒撕毁《凡尔赛条约》、签订《英德海军协定》后，开始设计允许德国建造的35,000吨级战斗舰，就是后来的俾斯麦级战列舰。俾斯麦级共有2艘，排水量实际上超过规定（40,000吨以上），分别为俾斯麦号和提尔皮茨号。俾斯麦级是德国二战下水的唯一级别战列舰，在美国的依阿华级和日本的大和级下水前，她们一直是世界上最大型的战列舰。航速最高可达29节，航程9000海浬（19节），配有8门380毫米的主炮、12门150毫米副炮。装甲侧舷可达320毫米、甲板最厚处也有200毫米。俾斯麦号和提尔皮茨号分别以汉诺威号的替代舰—F舰与什利兹威格-荷尔斯泰因号的替代舰—G舰之名开始建造，并分别于1940年8月和1941年2月服役。雷德尔于Z计划也拟定了多艘不同于俾斯麦级的战斗舰建造计划，即H级战斗舰（H计划 兴登堡级），并以H、J、K、L等代号起工兴建，该级战斗舰的主炮口径、装甲厚度和排水量（L舰满载排水量就有98,000吨）皆很高，预定作为北海突破英国舰队的主力，但因为战争过早爆发、原物料的短缺和希特勒的反对，直到战争结束都没有一艘被制造出来。\n主要服役：俾斯麦级战列舰（俾斯麦号在丹麦海峡海战中被英国皇家海军击沉，提尔皮茨号在挪威海峡被英重磅炸弹击沉），H计划-H（39），H（41）（即兴登堡级，未完成）。\n装甲舰、战列巡洋舰和重巡洋舰\n在俾斯麦级的设计尚未出现前，德国海军因为条约的限制而设计建造了3艘德意志级装甲舰，它们拥有战列舰的火力和巡洋舰的排水量，并以电焊来减轻舰身重量、使用柴油引擎和轻装甲，配有6门280毫米主炮、8门150毫米副炮，最高航速可达26节，其火力比重巡洋舰强、航速比战列舰快，是良好的水面破交舰。原本预计还要再建造2艘，但因为法国建造了专门应付德意志级的敦刻尔克级战列舰（航速最快到32节，配有330毫米主炮），便开始设计新型主力舰，原本先设计了D级装甲舰，并预计建造2艘，但后来被沙恩霍斯特级所取代。沙恩霍斯特级结合了一战来不及完成的麦肯森级和德弗林格尔级的设计，最后建造完成的共有2艘，为沙恩霍斯特号和格奈森瑙号，分别于1938年5月和1939年1月服役。其最高航速可达33节，装甲则超过战列巡洋舰、火力则与战列巡洋舰相同，配有9门280毫米主炮（原预定要换成380毫米的火炮，但因战争过早来临而取消）、12门150毫米的副炮，可以说是德意志级装甲舰的强化型，同时也有舰种划分的争议，介于战斗舰和战列巡洋舰之间；德国海军之后还发展出O级战列巡洋舰（O-1计划）和P级装甲舰（P-1计划），并预定在Z计划中建造，但这2种级别没有一艘完成。除了以上主力舰外，因为《英德海军协定》允许德国拥有更多军舰，德国海军也开始规划了重巡洋舰的建造，建造了2艘希佩尔海军上将级（之后又扩增到5艘），拥有8门203毫米主炮、12门105毫米副炮，并拥有颇高的发炮速度和厚重的装甲，但其引擎不稳定、容易故障。\n主要服役：格奈森瑙，沙恩霍斯特（被英国皇家海军约克公爵号击沉），希佩尔海军上将，布吕歇尔，欧根亲王（战后被美军作为核试验目标，触礁沉于比基尼环礁），德意志，舍尔海军上将，格拉夫·斯佩海军上将（于乌拉圭自沉），P-1/2计划，O-1/2计划。\n轻巡洋舰、驱逐舰\n德国海军在国家海军时期第一艘新建造中型军舰就是轻巡洋舰埃姆登（German cruiser Emden），其他还有2种级别—柯尼斯堡级（German K class cruiser）和莱比锡级。埃姆登的设计与一次大战的形式极为接近，配有8门150毫米炮（其中有4门位于舰身中线），主要用于训练和布雷等次要任务。柯尼斯堡级则为埃姆登更进一步的设计，火力加大到200毫米，并大幅提升了续航力；该级的3艘同型舰有2艘即在战争前期就沉没。而最后的莱比锡级则是柯尼斯堡级的改良版，武装和防护能力相同，但续航力和引擎出力进行了改良。1939年还有要建造6艘新型的M级轻巡洋舰（M计划），但被取消。驱逐舰方面，因为条约的建造限制，德国以加大吨位强化其战力的做法比其他盟军都来得早，尽管二战中德国的驱逐舰现代化程度远高过其他国家，但本身仍具有一些问题，如：在恶劣或潮湿的天气气候中，高压蒸汽涡轮引擎不稳定且续航力极短等。虽然在后期改善不少，但随着入侵挪威的重创以及希特勒决定将德国海军的建军核心移往U艇部队后水面舰的地位就没有多大影响。在二战爆发后，大多数驱逐舰部队投入英国海岸附近的通商航道布雷任务和为德国船团护航，其后也未建造新舰。德国驱逐舰由建造年作为级别名称，如1934年级（Zerst?rer 1934），到了1941年级（Zerst?rer 1936）后船名全部以Z开头，后面加上数字编号命名。此外在Z计划中曾预计建造一种大型的驱逐舰（Z/45），为搜索巡洋舰（Sp?hkreuzer），以攻击商船和侦查为主要任务，但没有一艘建造完成。\n主要服役：埃姆登，柯尼斯堡，卡尔斯鲁厄，科隆，莱比锡，纽伦堡，M计划，Z1-z39，z43，SP克洛泽D38，SP克洛泽D40。\n鱼雷艇、S艇、伪装巡洋舰\n德国在一战战后建造新式驱逐舰前，就已有数量众多的鱼雷艇，它们拥有一定的战斗能力，并在原本就为数不多的水面舰队里担任了辅助性的角色，如在北海布雷和拦截敦刻尔克撤退的船只、威瑟堡作战和海峡冲刺作战。德国从魏玛共和国时期到二战结束前后共建造51艘鱼雷艇，主要是国家海军时期的狼级（Raubtier-Klasse）和海鸥级鱼雷艇，以及于30年代中后期开始建造的现代化T级鱼雷艇（Torpedoboot 1935），到战争结束时全部仅剩12艘幸存，有些甚至服役到1950年代中期。德国还拥有大型鱼雷艇—S艇，在战争中先后担任了扫雷、布雷、护航和攻击的任务，德国于战争期间总投入249艘S艇，共有157艘被击沉或自沉，剩余92艘分给战胜国。在二战中共有9艘德国轻型商船被改装成伪装巡洋舰，用来进行破交战，拥有极佳的续航能力，与一战英国的反潜改装商船—Q艇（Q-ship）相同，在外形上与商船无异但拥有强大的火力，拥有150毫米舰炮、鱼雷发射管、水雷和侦察机，善于伪装成其他中立国的船只、放出假信号干扰敌人。1940年到1941年，于大西洋、印度洋、澳大利亚南部海域和南太平洋攻击商船。从1940年3月开始至战争结束，这些船舰共击沉了近150艘各式船只（商船、渔船、油轮和少量帆船）。\n\n### 潜艇\n\n由于船舶建设工程局的研究，德国潜艇并未落后国际，同时也在该机关中设计了二战爆发后的主力潜艇。主要使用的有II级、VII级和IX级潜艇，另外还有数量不多的I级、X级（布雷用）、XIV级（补给用）、XXI级和XXIII级。II型潜艇是由一战的UB型潜艇改良而来，原设计目的为训练舰，但在大战爆发潜艇数量不够时也被赋予作战任务。VII级潜艇为整场战争中德国潜艇部队的主力，尤其是VII级C型自1941年后的生产一直没停过。IX级潜艇为I级潜艇改良而来，适合远洋长期作战，作战范围可到太平洋，每艘IX级B型击沉吨位数都达到了10万吨。另外在战争后期，德国开发了绝气推进的XVII级潜艇（German Type XVII submarine），还有通气呼吸管和新型引擎的XXI级和XXIII级，以往潜艇水下航速都不过10节，但XXI级和XVII级则分别为17节和25节，且可以以12节到14节航速潜航10小时，能有效对抗盟军的海上巡逻机。战后它们成为现代潜艇设计的原型，特别是苏联的W级潜艇。德国在整场战争中投入了1162艘各种类型的潜艇、以各种形式沉没者共有785艘，还有156艘向盟军投降。水面舰艇共击沉246艘潜艇、岸基飞机击沉245艘、舰载机击沉43艘、飞机和船舰合作击沉50艘、盟军潜艇也击沉了21艘。共有32,000名潜艇人员阵亡。德国在战争期间还有开发出数种袖珍潜艇，其中有像黑人型袖珍潜艇（Neger）者，制造了200多艘于战争中使用。战争里德国潜艇除了执行攻击商船的任务外，也会担任运输和与日本交换物资的船只工作。另外还有曾研究能够发射V-2火箭的火箭潜艇（Rocket U-boat）计划，但没有完成。\n主要服役：2-A（2-B，2-D），7-A，7-B，7-C，7-F，9-A，9-B，9-C，9C-40D，9-D。"], "selected_questions": ["Z计划是什么，其目标是什么？", "邓尼兹提出的潜艇战斗群理论是什么，目的是什么？", "俾斯麦号战斗舰的沉没是如何发生的？"], "GPT3.5_answers_D":

{"name": "和同开珎", "documents": ["和同开珎，唐玄宗开元年间（713—741）流入中国的日本铜钱。是邻邦流到中国最早的方孔圆钱。始铸于奈良朝元明天皇和铜元年(708)，即唐中宗景龙二年。圆郭方孔， 币面为“和同开珎”四字，系仿唐开元通宝而铸。唐代封建经济文化高度发展，日本多次派遣唐使入唐，中日贸易的发展，此钱随之传入。和同年间曾铸和同开珎银钱，不久即废，铸额极少。钱币学家称之为“古和同”。\n\n1970年，陕西省西安市何家村发现唐邠王府窖藏文物，其中有日本“和同开珎”银币五枚。这种日本银币的形制，跟我国唐朝铸造的“开元通宝”很相似。历年来日本出土的唐朝铸造的“开元通宝”数以万计，而日本的“和同开珎”银币在本土都不常见，却在我国一次出土五枚。这是大唐与日本经济文化交流的最好见证。\n\n## 历史背景\n\n“开元通宝”始铸于唐高祖武德四年，即公元621年。“和同开珎”始铸于日本元明天皇和铜元年，即唐景龙二年、公元708年。元明天皇是天智天皇的第四个女儿、文武天皇的生母。公元707年，文武天皇去世，其生母登基，称“元明天皇”。元明天皇在位时间不长，只有八年，却对日本历史的发展作出了重大贡献。\n\n## 唐朝对日影响\n\n元明天皇登上政治舞台的时候，日本以大唐为楷模的大化改新基本完成了。为适应中央集权化律令政治发展的需要，元明天皇于公元710年，将都城由藤原京迁到交通便利、物产丰盈的大和平原北部的平城京。在迁都前后，她还改革币制；创设守山户，禁止砍伐林木；令太安万侣编撰了日本现存最早的史书《古事记》。以平城京为中心，日本的政治、经济、文化得到飞跃发展。元明天皇结束了飞鸟时代，开启了日本历史上盛极一时的奈良时代。\n\n## 改革币制\n\n是元明天皇实行的一项重要措施。据日本史书《和汉三才图会》记载：“和铜元年正月，武藏国始献和铜，因改年号为和铜。”《续日本纪》上说：“和铜元年二月甲戌，始置催铸钱司。”“五月壬寅，始行银钱。”“七月丙辰，令近江国铸铜钱。”“八月己已，始行铜钱。”和铜二年，“八月乙酉，废银钱一行铜钱。”“和铜三年九月乙丑，禁天下银钱。”“和同开珎”银币使用时间很短，它能够保存下来，是很珍贵的。\n\n### 日本文字\n\n日本原无文字，于公元5世纪开始用汉字记事。日本“和同开珎”银币上的文字用汉字隶书体，自右旋读，发什么音，是什么意思呢？\n日本学者狩谷棭斋认为，“同”系“铜”之省文，“珎”系“寳”之省文，故“和同开珎”应读为“和铜开寳”。日本明治时期的古钱币专家成岛柳北赞成狩谷棭斋的说法，并得到当时一些古钱币专家的附和响应。按照这种说法，“和同开珎”属于年号钱一类，钱币上的文字意思是：“和铜年间开始流通的宝货。”\n不过，反对此说的也大有人在。如日本古钱币专家平尾聚泉编的《和同开珎泉谱》就认为：“和同文字，其出典在《国语》。宝字虽有写宀冠加玉缶，省贝之例，却未有省去宀冠及贝之例，省缶则不能有宝之字音。”接着，他又援引前辈学者柏木探古楼的说法：“在和铜年以前，已有和铜钱。因未有文书传世，故无从各知其由来。现今古泉家言，日本天武朝之银铸钱，虽史无明文，实即古和同钱。日本元明朝（元明天皇朝）之铸钱记事中，未记明铸钱文字者，盖以前代已有‘和同开珍’，此系补铸，故而省略。当然不能谓银钱（银铸钱）为‘和同开寳’。‘和同开珎’为日本天武朝之钱文（铸钱文字），犹如唐之以‘开通元宝’（笔者注：指“开元通宝”）为钱文，唐朝曾连续补铸开通钱，日本亦效之，连续补铸。”按照平尾聚泉和柏木探古楼的说法，“和同开珎”银币不是年号钱，“珎”应读为“珍”。\n\n### 学者意见\n\n笔者认为，柏木探古楼和平尾聚泉两位先生提出“和同开珎”银币上的“和同”二字不是年号的见解，可以聊备一说。虽然在“史无明文”的情况下，他们居然提出“天武朝之银铸钱”，“实即古和同钱”，难免有武断之嫌疑，但是，“和同文字，其出典《国语》”的说法，联系日本当时采用汉字的史实，还是有些道理的。另外，日本“和同开珎”钱文效法唐朝“开元通宝”钱文是无可争辩的事实，而“开元”二字与唐高祖年号无关，是开始新纪元的意思，那么“和同”二字也许与元明天皇年号无关。至于柏木探古楼和平尾聚泉两位先生提出“珎”不应读“寳”，而应读“珍”的见解，笔者不敢苟同。理由之一，他们提出“宝”字虽有写宀冠加王缶，省贝之例，却未有省去宀冠及贝之例的说法不能成立。宝字省去宀冠，再省去贝，剩下“珤”，这正是宝字的一种古字。南朝梁顾野王编撰的以解释字音字义为主的《玉篇》就收有此字。《穆天子传》上说：“示女舂山上珤。”注：“言此山多珍宝奇怪。”理由之二，他们提出宝字“省缶则不能有宝之字音”的说法也不能成立。东汉许慎《说文解字》：“宝，珍也。从宀、从王、从贝、缶声。”“缶”是宝字的声符，的确“省缶则不能有宝字之音”。但问题是日本“和同开珎”银币上的“珎”字，并未省“缶”。值得大家注意的是，“开元通寳”上的“寳”字，由宀、王、尔、贝四部分组成。它是宝的异体字，据《精编金石大字典》记载，吴宝鼎甎拓片和西巍王宝印上都用这个字。明末张自烈撰的《正字通》收有此字。比较一下“宝”与“寳”，可知异体寳字用“尔”取代了正体宝字的“缶”。那么，既然“珤”读宝，当然“珎”也可以读宝。理由之三，我国古代钱币可称“宝”、称“货”、称“泉”而未有称“珍”者。日本元明天皇时期使用汉字，也不应当称钱为“珍”。\n\n##

参考0：至于柏木探古楼和平尾聚泉两位先生提出“珎”不应读“寳”，而应读“珍”的见解，笔者不敢苟同。理由之一，他们提出“宝”字虽有写宀冠加王缶，省贝之例，却未有省去宀冠及贝之例的说法不能成立。宝字省去宀冠，再省去贝，剩下“珤”，这正是宝字的一种古字。南朝梁顾野王编撰的以解释字音字义为主的《玉篇》就收有此字。《穆天子传》上说：“示女舂山上珤。”注：“言此山多珍宝奇怪。”理由之二，他们提出宝字“省缶则不能有宝之字音”的说法也不能成立。东汉许慎《说文解字》：“宝，珍也。从宀、从王、从贝、缶声。”“缶”是宝字的声符，的确“省缶则不能有宝字之音”。但问题是日本“和同开珎”银币上的“珎”字，并未省“缶”。值得大家注意的是，“开元通寳”上的“寳”字，由宀、王、尔、贝四部分组成。它是宝的异体字，据《精编金石大字典》记载，吴宝鼎甎拓片和西巍王宝印上都用这个字。明末张自烈撰的《正字通》收有此字。比较一下“宝”与“寳”，可知异体寳字用“尔”取代了正体宝字的“缶”。那么，既然“珤”读宝，当然“珎”也可以读宝。

{"name": "P-39战斗机", "documents": ["## P-39战斗机\nP-39 空中眼镜蛇（P-39 Airacobra）是一款由美国贝尔飞机公司设计的战斗机，曾在第二次世界大战期间活跃。P-39与其他同一时期的战斗机设计上最大的差异就是其发动机的位置：P-39的发动机是在机身的中央，飞行员的后方，前方的螺旋桨则以一根很长的驱动轴由发动机驱动。这种设计最大的优点就是将整架飞机最重的部分放置在飞机重心上，使得飞机的运动性能得以提升。另外一项特点是有别于当时广泛与运用在战斗机上的后三点起落架，此机型使用前三点的起落架。\n## 设计及历史\n第一架XP-39原型机于1938年4月6日首次试飞，原始设计是规划装载V-1710-17液冷式发动机并搭配奇异公司的涡轮增压器而能执行高空作战任务的单座战斗机。其机鼻空间也可容纳大口径机砲（37mm）而成为P-39在火力配置上的特点。原型机的性能相当出色，在两万英尺高度时可以达到390英里／时空速。然而这架原型机并未安装任何武器，装甲和其他量产飞机上需要的航电装备，因此与后续实战配备机型在基本重量上产生不小的差距。稍后美国陆军航空队（由于产量不足与莱特机场的某些官僚政治因素）向贝尔公司的设计部门要求删除该机原本配备的涡轮增压器，更导致P-39在6000英呎以上的性能大幅衰退。不仅如此，由于装设自封油箱会减少机内燃料携带量，缩短滞空时间，结果使得量产型P-39与预期的性能差距很大，甚至被评批为尚未服役就落伍的设计，中置引擎布局也使得P-39维修不便，需要移除许多蒙皮才能维修引擎，这在前线机场的维护工作上是相对不利的。\n第一款量产的P-39在机鼻安装一门37毫米机砲，.30与.50机枪各两挺，此一武装配置在P-39D型时改为机鼻的37毫米机砲与两挺.50机枪，机翼两边各两挺.30机枪。\nP-39在二次世界大战初期曾一度短暂的的作为美国陆军航空军的主力，尤其曾进驻瓜岛的亨德森机场，用于和日军作战，但是很快的由于性能劣势而退居二线与担任训练任务。美国转而将大量出厂的P-39在租借法案下运往苏联，让这种飞机在苏联战场找到另外一片天空。\n虽然起初苏联飞行员也和美国的同行一样对本机表现诸多恶评，认为顶多只能弥补当时产量不足的Yak-9和La-5战斗机，加上苏联官方刻意压低外援飞机在苏联战场上的表现。\n但因为其在寒冷的苏联领空下表现十分实用可靠，P-39凭借其先天设计，具备在低空（与德军的Bf109与Fw190相比之下较）良好的机动性与坚固装甲，以及1942年时战斗机航炮口径之冠的火力，以及当时苏联战斗机普遍缺乏的无线电设备，得以在实战（特别是低空空域与前线的战术性制空任务）与德国空军有效抗衡，让飞行员有机会存活并累积经验而逐渐能够克敌制胜。不仅获得相当程度的好评，也取得优异的击落纪录，成为多位苏军王牌飞行员的座机。\n大战结束时P-39总共出厂9529架，扣除损失的部分，有4789架运抵苏联。", "P-39战斗机（英文：P-39 Fighter\n，译文：空中飞蛇），是美国一型单座单发平直翼活塞式战斗机。\nP-39战斗机作为一种尝试，该机将发动机放在座舱后面，通过一根延长轴驱动机头的螺旋桨，座舱布置相应靠前，从而改变了飞机的构造。该机装有4挺机枪，在发动机延长轴内还布置了一门37MM机炮，在二战中这也算得上数一数二的强火力。\n“空中飞蛇”还是二战中最早使用前三点起落架的战斗机之一。\nP-39战斗机由美国贝尔公司研制，1938年首飞。\n\n## 发展沿革\n\n### 研制背景\n\n在喷气发动机出现以前，战斗机通常的布局都是发动机前置，但贝尔飞机公司的“飞蛇”战斗机是首次采用发动机后置布局的美国战斗机。先前，英国韦斯特兰公司和库尔霍文公司的战斗机上采用过这种布局，然而 P-39 飞机是第一种投入大量生产的这样布局的飞机。\n把发动机后移到重心位置之后，某些优点变得突出了。细长的机头可以使流线型和视界更好，并且，可以容纳重型军械和前三点起落架的可收放式前轮。这种起落架地面操纵性好，并能提高着陆速度，这样机翼就可以设计的较小从而也提高了空速；但这并不是完全有利的，因为大的翼载荷妨害了爬升和高空机动性。\n\n### 建造沿革\n\n1937年5月18日，贝尔飞机公司向陆军提交了一份“飞蛇”飞机的技术说明书。同年10月7日，军方订购了一架XP-39原型机。使用带涡轮增压器的艾利森V-1710-17发动机，通过一根 3.05 米的长轴带动螺旋桨。该发动机的起飞功率为1150马力，在6100米高度上的功率为1000马力。技术条件要求：在海平面和 6,100 米高度上的最大速度分别为530 公里/小时和 644 公里/小时；爬升到 6100 米高度的时间为 5 分钟。但上述条件只有在空重和总重分别为1815 千克和 2,520 千克的条件下才能实现。而后来的发展已远远超出了这两个重量。该机安装带 400 发子弹的两挺 12.7 毫米协调式机枪和在它下面的一门带 50 发炮弹的 25 毫米机炮，炮管穿过螺旋桨桨毂伸出，但这门 25 毫米机炮于 1938 年 12 月 2 日为一门带 20 发炮弹的 37 毫米 T-9 机炮所代替（实际上这架原型机在飞行试验时，没有装武器）。\n1939年4 月，在戴顿作了首次飞行试验，4 月 27 日，陆军航空队就签订了 12 架 YP-39 和一架 YP-39A 作战适用性试验机合同。经初步试验后，美国国家航空咨询委员会对原型机作了研究，并又运回布法罗工厂进行修改。这些修改使飞机大为改观。在 XP-39 飞机上放在发动机后部机身两侧的散热器，移置于修改过的翼根内，其进气口在前缘处。封闭式座舱下移了；为了更流线化，把主轮覆盖起来了。汽化器进气口设在座舱后面；涡轮增压器卸掉了；原来的发动初改成 V-1710-37 发动机，此发动机在 4,060 米高度上的功率 1,090 马力。\n1939 年 11 月 25 日首次飞行的改型后的原型机被编号为 XP-39B，并且实验证明，把它的一些特点用在订购中的 YP-39 飞机上是足以令人满意的。起先，YP-39 与原型机一样，要装涡轮增压器，在 6,100 米高度上酌速度为 605 公里/小时，爬升至此高度的时间为 6 分钟；实用升限为 12,600 米；而改进后的 YP-39A 没装涡轮增压器，在 3,050 米高度上速度为 578 公里/小时。1940 年 1 月，所有 13 架作战适用性试验机都选用不带涡轮增压器的 V-1710-37 发动机，而未选用原计划的 V-1710-17 和 V-1710-19 发动机。\n\n不装涡轮增压器的决定是“飞蛇”飞机发展中关键的一步，因为，虽然此决定使这种飞机花钱少，低空操纵性好，但严重地损害了高空性能。这一缺陷是早期的 P-40 和 P-38 的英国改型所共有的。第一架 YP-39（贝尔 12 型）飞机出现于 1940 年 9 月，在 4,140 米高度上最大速度为 591 公里/小时。军械由一门带 15 发炮弹的 37 毫米机炮、共带 400 发子弹的两挺 12.7 毫米机枪和共带 1,000 发子弹的两挺 7.6 毫米机枪组成，它们都设在机头内。飞行员座舵用装甲保护；飞行员由汽车式侧门而不是由普通的滑动座舱盖进入飞机。\n“飞蛇”的大批生产订货的开始是在 1939 年 8 月 10 日，当时要为陆军制造临时编号为 P-45 的 80 架贝尔 13 型飞机。1940 年 4 月 13 日，替英国政府订购了贝尔 14 型飞机；9 月 13 日陆军购买了贝尔 15 型飞机。第二天，前一合同有所改变，以致最后 60 架飞机能获得专门为 1940 年订购的这些飞机而设的防漏油箱和机翼机枪。\n涂着伪装漆的生产型飞机于 1941 年 1 月开始出现，它安装在 3,660 米高度上功率为 1,150 马力的 V-1710-35 发动机。头 20 架是 P-39C（前称 P-45），除发动机外，与 YP-39 相同。该公司其余的 60 架成为 P-39D（贝尔 15 型），这种全副武装的“飞蛇”飞机有防漏油箱和共带 4,000 发子弹的 4 挺 7.62 毫米机翼机枪。共带 400 发子弹的两挺 12.7 毫米协调式机枪位于一门带 30 发炮弹的 37 毫米机头机炮的上方。因为油箱防护使内部燃油容量从 643 公升下降到 455 公升，故 P-39D 飞机装一个 281 公升的机腹副油箱（亦可挂一枚 227 千克的炸弹）。所有这些重量，包括 83.5 千克和 27.7 千克的装甲玻璃风档，对爬升产生了不良影响。\n继头60架P-39D飞机之后，按1940年的合同，与229架P-39F一起又交付了344架，P-39F飞机除改变了螺旋桨（通用汽车公司航空产品部生产的螺旋桨代替寇蒂斯飞机公司的产品）和排气装置外，与P-39D相似。艾利森V-1710-59发动机装到了此合同最后25架飞机上，编号为P-39J。所有这几种飞机在公司档案中称为15型，并有相同的特性。\n\n## 技术特点\n\n气动结构\n机内空间狭小紧张，飞行员操作不便；发动机高空功率不足；静稳定性差，不易操纵；侧开的汽车式舱门进出不便，逃生困难；结构复杂，维修困难\n。\n全金属结构，完善的通讯设备（在二战时期，通讯设备较顶尖），前三点起落架。\n\n## 性能数据\n\nXP-39战斗机参考数据\n艾利森 V-1710-17，1150 马力（起飞），1000 马力（高度 6,100

服役动态\n\n服役之初，P-39在上升到4267米（14000英尺）的高度时，其正常吸气的艾利逊（Allison）V-1710发动机就应付不了这个高度的稀薄空气（即发动机动力不足）。具有讽刺意义的是，在1938年-1939年间的评估后，美国陆军航空部队和国家航空咨询委员会的官员告诉贝尔公司：当时采用的V-1710涡轮增压发动机对于“空中眼镜蛇”，这样是没有必要的。\n由于发动机装在机身中部，每次检修发动机，地勤人员都恨不得把飞机大卸八块。二战中不少“空中飞蛇”被作为援助物资交给苏联空军使用，苏联红军十分喜爱这种飞机，记录显示苏军使用的各种外国战斗机中，“空中飞蛇”的战绩排名第一。此外，自由法国空军和投向盟军的意大利空军也曾使用过“空中飞蛇”。在P-39“空中飞蛇”基础上，贝尔公司还发展出P-63“眼镜王蛇”，该机成为贝尔公司最成功的量产固定翼飞机。\n\nP-39随美国陆军航空兵的作战单位在北非、地中海和太平洋战场发挥了战斗作用。1944年初，2150架P-39进入一线服役或充当教练机。这是P-39最辉煌的时刻：9558架P-39中，有4733架在前苏联空军中参加了很多战斗\n。\n\n## 总体评价\n\n贝尔P-39“飞蛇”是二战美军装备序列里面一种极具个性的飞机，这种个性不光表现于极流畅的线条；发动机放在座舱后面，座舱布置相应靠前；巨大的37mm同轴机炮这些外在因素上，更表现于不装涡轮增压，重低空性能，高空渣渣的设计思想上，与美军其他飞机大相径庭。该机还采用了前三点起落架，可能又是单座战斗机的第一号。\n\n该机在太平洋的几次实战中，被日本人的“零”式和“奥斯卡”打得大败亏输，更让美国陆军航空队对它失去了所有信心。特别是当时美国有多种新式战斗机可供选择，失宠的 P-39 被降格当教练机，在美国国内训练新飞行员。但是如前所说，该机的操纵性能不是很好，需要熟练的飞行员才能发挥性能，新手飞行事故率比较高，所以连飞行学员也不喜欢它。当时航空学员中流行着一首俚歌：\n涂有醒目白色条纹的P-39Q，用于执行轰炸机炮手训练任务——当靶机\n“三十九，三十九，发动机装背后，翻来转去打筋斗，刨出一个大窟窿——嗨，嗨。不要给我三十九。”\n1944 年，波克雷什金在庆祝他的又一次空战胜利，代表每次胜利的小红星就涂在 P-39 机首左舷。\n由于 P-39 装备了大口径机炮，在东线常常担任对地突击任务，并且获得了极大的成功。同时 P-39 广泛被使用在空优作战中，它的性能并不象一般人想的那么拙劣，如前所述，它非常适合苏联飞行员。\n同盟军第四号王牌，两次“苏联英雄”称号获得者格里戈里·列奇卡洛夫大尉取得的 58 架战果中，有 44 架是用 P-39 完成的，他驾驶着 P-39 一直到战争结束（战绩远不如他的驾驶 P-51 出战的美军王牌们真该感到惭愧）。至于 P-39 的大口径火炮，单发命中带来的破坏威力给苏联人留下了深刻印象，这也是苏联战后从米格-9 开始的一系列飞机安装 37MM 火炮的原因。\n回头说说美国人，他们对自己当年耍的小聪明心知肚明。二战结束后就是冷战，双方一直没有交流。后来 1959 年，国际航空协会在莫斯科举行年会，第一位突破音障的美国飞行员 C·E·耶格尔作为专机驾驶员来到苏联。苏联人为他举行了盛大宴会，许多高级飞行员和军官参加。在交谈中耶格尔发现原来苏联人很喜欢 P-39（因为耶格尔对学员时代的 P-39 非常喜爱而找到了共同语言），绝对没有认为美国人给的是废物。这时候美国人才放下心来，于是心安理得\n。"], "selected_questions":

{"name": "弗莱彻级驱逐舰", "documents": ["## 弗莱彻级驱逐舰\n弗莱彻级驱逐舰是第二次世界大战中美国海军的驱逐舰级，总计生产了175艘，是单一生产量最高的驱逐舰级，因此也常被当作二战美军最具代表性的驱逐舰。弗莱彻级驱逐舰在众多方面都被认为性能优秀，胜任防空、反潜与水面作战各种任务，航程又足以覆盖美军舰队在太平洋上的行动。此级驱逐舰于二战后大多仍继续服役，加上之后移交美国盟友之海军，总服役时间相当的长。\n## 设计\n弗莱彻级是美军在后条约时代设计的第一代驱逐舰，其中专门注重在太平洋作战的需要。在伦敦海军条约失效后，美国海军决定设计比格里维斯级驱逐舰更大的驱逐舰以确保足以对抗日本后条约驱逐舰。弗莱彻级在主武器火力上并没有明显的提高，但强化了防空火力，具有更好的扩充性。相比之前的班森级和格里维斯级驱逐舰，弗莱彻级的排水量增加了约500吨，轴马力也因此从50000匹提高到了60000匹。和前级舰艇相比更大的舰体使得弗莱彻级除了能沿中心线搭载5门5\"/38 caliber gun和2具五联装Mk 15型鱼雷发射管以对抗它国同级驱逐舰外，还有可观的防空火力。在最初的设计中，弗莱彻级只有一门四联装28毫米75倍径高射机炮和六挺勃朗宁M2重机枪作为防空火力，在二战爆发后，面对日军航空兵的威胁，防空火力被逐渐加强到了两门双联装博福斯40毫米高射炮和七门单装厄利孔20毫米机炮。为了应对二战后期日军的神风自杀式攻击，自1945年开始共有51艘弗莱彻级驱逐舰接受了进一步的防空火力改装，拆掉了舰艏鱼雷发射管和舰舯双联装40毫米炮，以两门四联装40毫米炮代替，七门单装20毫米炮也被换成六门双联装20毫米炮。在反潜作战方面，原本设计中的弗莱彻级在舰艉部有两架深水炸弹投放轨，在二战期间则在两舷又加装了6具K型深水炸弹发射器（K-gun），可将炸弹抛射至137米之外。\n## 历史\n1942年6月4日对美国海军来说是个值得纪念的日子，在中途岛，美军击沈了4艘日本航空母舰，顿挫了日本帝国海军的气势。同一天，弗莱彻级的首舰“弗莱彻”号（以纪念著名美国海军将领弗莱德·弗莱彻）也在东海岸入役。美国惊人的生产力也在弗莱彻级上得到了展现——从开工到下水平均只需212天，再到正式入役平均只需152天，总计364天，比前级快了10%，庞大的数目为盟军的最终胜利做出了不小贡献。\n弗莱彻级驱逐舰在二战中共制造175艘（另有13艘的订单随着战争结束被取消），损失25艘，其中19艘被击沈，另6艘损坏过于严重放弃修复。44艘得到超过10颗战斗之星，19艘得到Navy Unit Commendation，16艘得到总统部队嘉许奖。二战结束后，所有驱逐舰均被除役封存，但随着朝鲜战争爆发又被大批召回继续服役，其中39艘接受了现代化改装。\n在1950年代，大量弗莱彻级驱逐舰在接受现代化改装后被转卖给美国的盟国海军，其中2艘给日本海上自卫队、3艘给大韩民国海军、4艘给中华民国海军。美军剩余的弗莱彻级，除“苏利文兄弟”号、“纪德”号和“卡森·杨”号外，均在1970年代被解体。最后一艘除役的弗莱彻级驱逐舰是墨西哥海军的“库伊特拉华克”号（ARM Cuitláhuac），于2001年除役，在争取保存失败后于2010年解体，意味着弗莱彻级驱逐舰服役长达近60年，并一直使用到21世纪。\n## 同级舰\n由于数量众多，仅简介比较有名的舰艇：", "弗莱彻级（Fletcher-class）驱逐舰，是美军在战争后期南太平洋战区的主力战舰，于1940年1月研发。\n\n## 舰史介绍\n\n“弗莱彻”级是美国二战中最著名的驱逐舰，它组成了二战中后期美国海军驱逐舰队的主力。总共175艘的“弗莱彻”级在短短两年间赶造出来，并参加了战争中后期的各次重要海上战役。值得注意的是美国驱逐舰的设计从“弗莱彻”级开始又回到了平甲板船型的路子上来。二战后，幸存的“弗莱彻”级进行了改装，部分舰只重新定级为DDE和DDR，70年代全部退役。有一部分移交其他国家或地区海军。\n\n## 建造概况\n\n在1940年1月“弗莱彻”级以1941型驱逐舰的名义定型并开始详细工程设计的同时，一项庞大的驱逐舰建造计划也渐渐浮出水面。1940年6月28日，美国海军开出首批7艘“弗莱彻”级的建造订单，接着又在7月1日追加了另外17艘。同年9月9日，军方再次向全国造船企业抛出一个大蛋糕，一举订购了多达96艘“弗莱彻”级驱逐舰，虽然在同年12月16日取消了其中7艘的建造计划，但同时又增加了6艘新舰，使得“弗莱彻级的建造数量达到119艘，所需资金全部由1941财年的预算拨付。在1941年12月日军奇袭珍珠港后，美国海军立即决定增建56艘同级舰，由1942财年的预算提供资金支持，这样“弗莱彻”级的总建造数量达到了创纪录的175艘！\n“弗莱彻”级的建造计划极大刺激了美国造船业的扩张和由民船建造向军船建造的转型。由于建造数量庞大，需要更多的船厂参与其中，一些民间船厂借此东风得到政府的资助，完成升级改造，承建新型驱逐舰，比如加利福尼亚州圣佩德罗的伯利恒船厂（Bethlehem，San Pedro）最初只是一座修船厂，在承接海军订货后升级为造船厂，最终建造了10艘“弗莱彻”级驱逐舰，一些老牌造船企业也借机开辟新的生产线，扩大产能，带来了不少就业机会。最终有11家造船企业瓜分了175艘驱逐舰的订单，其中包括8家民间船厂和3家海军船厂，以缅因州的巴斯钢铁公司（Bath Iron Works）建造数量最多，达到31艘！最先开工的“弗莱彻”级驱逐舰是1941年3月3日在巴斯钢铁公司铺下龙骨的“尼古拉斯”（Nicholas，DD-449）和“奥班农”号（O’Bannon，DD-450），其中“尼古拉斯”号于1942年2月19日下水，1942年6月4日竣工，成为第一艘服役的“弗莱彻”级驱逐舰，到1942年底时已经有22艘同级舰建成。进入1943年，“弗莱彻”级开始大批量服役，一年之内有121艘同级舰从美国本土开赴太平洋前线，特别是在同年5月至9月间，每个月都有10-12艘舰服役，五个月中先后共有56艘舰加入现役行列。随着美国船厂开始建造更大的“艾伦·M·萨姆纳”级（Allen M. Sumner class）和“基林”级（Gearing class），“弗莱彻”级的产量遂在1944年大幅回落，但全年仍有30艘服役。1945年初，最后两艘同级舰建成，她们是由普吉特湾海军船厂（PugetSound Navy Yard）承 建的“希尔兹”（Shields，DD-596）和“威利”号（Wiley，DD-597），其中后者在1945年3月14日成为最后一艘入役的“弗莱彻”级驱逐舰，她们的工程因为船厂承担繁重的修船任务而被拖延。\n\n## 船体配置\n\n### 船体结构\n\n“弗莱彻”级的舰体为混合骨架结构，双层船底，采用焊接方式建造。从龙骨两侧至主甲板由低到高排列了32根纵向骨架，每舷有16根，沿着整个舰体由舰首延伸至舰尾，此外还有15根纵向骨架布置于主甲板平面上，作为甲板支撑结构。“弗莱彻”级的横向骨架数量为210根，其中包含14道水密隔壁和7道油密隔壁，横向骨架的间隔为0.53米。14道水密隔壁将舰体划分为15个水密区划，所有水密舱门都开设在第1平台甲板以上，以确保水线下舰体各区划间的水密性，其中位于72号和157号肋骨的两道水密隔壁分别构成动力舱室的前壁和后壁，没有开设任何舱门，只能由主甲板上的开口进入锅炉舱和轮机舱，使得整个动力舱成为一个独立的大水密区划，加强舰体进水时动力系统的安全性。此外用于分隔燃料舱的油密隔壁也能提供额外的水密防护。\n\n### 动力系统\n\n出众的机动性、高速性和持久的续航力一直是驱逐舰追求的目标，“弗莱彻”级在设计时就着眼于配合新型主力舰和快速航空母舰作战的需要，将航速指标定在38节的高度上。在吨位尺度比先代驱逐舰明显增加的情况下，“弗莱彻”级需要一颗更加强劲、活力充沛的心脏，其动力系统延续了“本森”级的基本配置，由两座高性能蒸汽轮机和四台燃油锅炉构成，采用双轴双桨推进，但其主机输出功率增加，以获得更高的航速。“弗莱彻”级的主机是两座由通用电气公司（General Electric）生产的减速齿轮蒸汽轮机，布置在前后两个独立的轮机舱内，每座主机均由高压轮机、巡航轮机及低压轮机组成（后期型增加了倒车轮机），机组通过齿轮减速装置与推进轴相连，其中前轮机舱的主机驱动左侧推进轴，后轮机舱的主机负责驱动右侧推进轴，进而带动两具直径3.66米的三叶青铜螺旋桨。推动主机运行的蒸汽来自四台由巴布科克&威尔科克斯公司（Babcock& Wilcox）生产的M型单烟道燃油锅炉，其性能堪称是当时世界各国舰用重油锅炉中的佼佼者，蒸汽压力为43.3公斤/平方厘米，最高蒸汽温度为454℃。四台锅炉两台一组分别布置在两个独立的锅炉舱内，呈纵向排列，分别通过前后烟囱排出烟气，前后锅炉舱均有独立的燃油泵向锅炉提供燃料。在动力舱布局上，“弗莱彻”级沿用了四代驱逐舰的锅炉舱—轮机舱交错布置的模式，使动力系统的安全系数上升，在战斗中即使单个锅炉舱或轮机舱被击中损坏，也不会导致全舰丧失航行能力。动力系统的主控制室设在前轮机舱内。\n\n### 电力系统\n\n“弗莱彻”级的电力系统由与蒸汽轮机连接的主发电机和应急柴油发电机构成，前者包括两台250千瓦/450伏发电机和两台40千瓦 /120伏发电机，后者为一台100千瓦 /450伏柴油发电机，用于在全舰丧失动力时提供应急电力。\n\n### 雷达系统\n\n“弗莱彻”级是美国海军第一级在建造时就安装雷达的驱逐舰，每一艘舰在服役时都配备了完善的雷达系统，包括对空搜索雷达和对海搜索雷达，在与日本海军的较量中掌握了一件克敌制胜的法宝。美国海军舰载雷达的研制可以追溯到30年代初，于1938年制成第一部试验性对空雷达，并在“纽约”号战列舰上进行试用，取得成功，之后少量生产列装。在此基础上美国海军针对早期雷达天线尺寸大、测距精度低的问题继续开发二代舰载对空雷达，于1941年推出代号 XRA 的新型雷达，在驱逐舰“塞姆斯”号上试用，经过改进后以SC雷达的名称列装，成为美国海军在二战期间装备的主力舰载对空雷达。在1942年至1945年间，通用电气公司向海军交付了超过1000部SC雷达及其各种改型。“弗莱彻”级装备的对空搜索雷达主要为 SC-1型，波长为1.36米，置于主桅平台上的平板天线重204公斤，尺寸为2.12×2.59米，转速为12秒/周，发射功率200千瓦，工作频率200兆赫，最大对空探测距离为120公里（对飞行高度1000米的轰炸机），测距精度90米，测角精度5度。SC-1型雷达的主控台上装有15英寸PPI平面显示器和5英寸A型示波器，操作使用十分方便。SC型雷达的性能较日军的同类装备更为出色，装备时间更早，日本海军于1942年下半年才在一些大型舰艇上安装21号对空电探，而适合驱逐舰装备的雷达设备直到1943年才上舰。\n除了 SC 型对空雷达外，“弗莱彻”级还配备了 SG型对海搜索雷达，这是美国海军装备的第一种微波对海搜索雷达，1942年列装，由雷声公司制造，产量也超过1000部，普遍装备从航母到驱逐舰等各类舰艇。SG 型雷达全套设备重量998公斤，波长10厘米，发射功率50千瓦，工作频率3000兆赫，配用的弧形天线重158.8公斤，尺寸为1.12×1.26米，非常轻便，适于驱逐舰安装，天线转速可调，根据不同情况每分钟可转4、8或12周，对大型舰船的最大探测距离达41公里，对小型舰船则为30公里，还能发现低空飞行的敌机，测距精度180米，测角精度2度，其主控台配有9英寸 PPI 平面显示器和5英寸 A 型示波器。SG 型雷达在改进后还具有在狭窄水道中导航的功能，堪称一机多用。美国海军对 SG 型雷达印象良好，曾有人形容与它打交道就像驾驶一辆设计精良的汽车一样让人愉悦。\n\n### 居住系统\n\n“弗莱彻”级在中甲板室设有专门的洗衣房，内部配有洗衣机、风干机、熨衣板、晾衣架等一系列设备，自动化程度较高，为全舰官兵提供洗衣服务。由于舰上人员众多，各分队按照事先排好的次序轮流洗涤衣物，每个分队每周至少可以洗涤一次，军官的衣物则单独清洗。当其他国家的水兵还要手洗军服时，美国水兵已经从这项劳作中解放出来。整洁的衣物对于维护舰员身体健康，改善舰上卫生环境，维持良好军容，增进士气具有重要作用。\n“弗莱彻”级的厨房也设在中甲板室内，位于洗衣房隔壁，内部各种烹调设备配置齐全，电烤箱、蒸汽锅、烧烤架、油炸锅等一应俱全，还有清洗池和专用操作台，烹饪条件一流。在舰体前部第3平台甲板上设有冷库，可以存储水果、蔬菜、生鲜肉类，保证每日为全舰官兵提供丰盛美味的食物。每当用餐时间，从厨房里飘出新鲜面包的香味，让水兵们心驰神往。不过，在恶劣海况条件下，舰上厨师则要非常小心，因为军舰的摇摆颠簸可能会使蒸汽锅中的热汤或是油锅中的滚油溢出，被烫伤就不妙了。官兵们依据等级高低分开用餐，舰上设有水兵餐厅、军士餐厅和军官餐厅，在内部装修和陈设方面存在较大差别，最豪华的军官餐厅配有高级餐桌和舒适的靠背椅，还附带有专用小厨房，由专职厨师为军官们开小灶。值得一提的是，在用餐完毕后所有餐具统一由1940型自动洗碗机清洗，方便快捷。\n“弗莱彻”级上由低到高分为四类住舱：水兵舱、军士舱、军官舱和舰长舱，其舒适程度也逐次提高。水兵舱是最基本的住舱，全舰共有7处，前部有3处、后部有4处，面积大小不一，大型住舱有65个铺位，小型住舱有18个铺位，内设三层钢架吊床，在床底有个人储物柜，无空调设备，空气循环依靠舰上的通风系统，空间相对狭窄，在夏季十分闷热，对于舰员的意志是一个考验。在和平时期，水兵们以分队为单位居住在固定的舱室内，而战时则打乱编制混合居住，以免某舱室被击中后出现个别分队全体损失的情况。军士舱相比水兵舱环境稍好，位于第1平台甲板前部，远离动力舱，比较安静，内设三层钢架吊床，但铺位之间的距离增大，空间宽敞，储物柜容量也更大。军官舱也位于舰体前部第1平台甲板上，其陈设要比水兵舱和军士舱明显高出一个档次，设有双层或三层架子床、组合柜、办公桌和书架，还有换气扇和照明灯，即是休息睡眠的地方，也是军官们的临时办公场所。最后是全舰最奢华的舰长舱，“弗莱彻”级上有两处舰长舱，较大的一间位于前甲板室内，是日常起居室，内设单人床、组合式办公桌、壁挂式书架、换气扇等，在航海舰桥后部还有一间休息室，供舰长在战斗或值班间隙休憩。在后甲板室和舰体前部还设有盥洗室、淋浴间等设施，为舰员们沐浴洗漱提供方便。\n“弗莱彻”级搭载了两艘 Mk1型交通艇，置于前烟囱两侧的吊架上，供人员运输和海上联络使用，在紧急情况下也作为救生艇使用。这种小艇由三人操作，长7.92米、宽2.24米、满载吃水0.71米，排水量4.01吨，装有海军型25马力四冲程柴油机一台，单轴推进，最大航速7节，装载燃料28加仑，续航力110海里，可载25名舰员。“弗莱彻”级在上层建筑各处还设置了4-6组救生筏，每舷2-3组，每组2只，捆绑叠放。每只救生筏上都配有救生缆绳2条、应急物品储存罐2只及1副船桨，在舰长宣布弃舰后，这些救生筏就成了舰员们的生命之舟，在乘坐时伤员享有绝对优先权。\n\n## 武器装备\n\n### 主炮武器系统\n\n“弗莱彻”级最首要的克敌利器是其主炮武备系统，由5门127毫米高平两用舰炮及其射控装置构成，担负打击水面舰艇和远距离空中目标的双重任务。美国海军将舰炮分为平射舰炮和高平两用舰炮两类，前者是指最大仰角不超过35°，主要攻击水面目标的舰炮，后者是指最大仰角达到85°，能够同时担负对海打击和防空任务的舰炮，而“弗莱彻”级装备的Mk12型127毫米38倍径舰炮正属于后者。\n在炮塔布局上，“弗莱彻”级保持了三、四代驱逐舰普遍采用的样式，全部主炮沿舰体中心线配置，保证单舷发挥最大火力。炮位由前至后依次称为51、52、53、54和55号炮位，其中51、52号炮位分别处在舰首甲板和前甲板室顶部，呈背负式结构，53、54号炮位在后甲板室顶部前后，呈背靠背布局，55号炮位在舰尾甲板上，与54号炮位呈背负式结构，除了舰体中部的53号炮位射界为左右各140度外，其余各炮位的射界均为330度。“弗莱彻”级的每座炮塔都配有Mk2型弹药升降机，通过两条封闭管道提运弹药，由电力驱动，半自动控制，可以24-30发/分的速度向炮塔提供弹药，还配有引信自动装定装置，在将炮弹送进炮塔前就可完成引信装定。每门火炮备弹350发，全舰备弹1750发，具有较强的持续作战能力。“弗莱彻”级的主炮备弹量在战时不断增加，到1944年7月时已达3025发，包括存储在弹药库中的2775发（每门炮555发）和炮塔换装室内的250发待发弹（每门炮50发），以适应高强度的防空和对岸支援任务。\n\n### 中近程防空武器\n\n在“弗莱彻”级开始设计的30年代末，飞机已经成为海军舰艇的现实威胁，因此美国海军对新型驱逐舰的防空能力也提出了一定的要求，但相比舰炮、鱼雷乃至反潜武器，最初防空武器并不受到特别关注，在1939年底的早期设计中，“弗莱彻”级的5门127毫米高平两用炮将负责远距离防空任务，而近距离防空武器仅有4挺12.7毫米高射机枪，直到1940年初最后定案前夕才追加了一座四联装28毫米机关炮，作为近距离防空火力的补充。\n“弗莱彻”级最初预定配备的中近程防空武器为Mk1型28毫米75倍径水冷式机关炮和M2型12.7毫米勃朗宁水冷式高射机枪。Mk1型28毫米机关炮于1934年列装为美国海军标准近距防空武器，绰号“芝加哥钢琴”，因为种种技术问题直到1940年才实用化，均以四联装的形式装备上舰。单炮重252公斤，身管长2.083米，初速823米/秒，单炮最大射速150发/分，最大射程6770米，最大射高5790米，仰俯角度 -15°—+110°，俯仰速度24度/秒，使用8发弹夹供弹，从字面数据看性能尚可，但是在实战中因为震动过大容易导致卡壳，无法提供持续的火力，被证明难以应付高强度空袭，在1942年后被博福斯40毫米机关炮取代，仅在辅助舰艇上继续服役至1945年。“弗莱彻”级在后部上层建筑顶部的平台上装备了一座四联装28毫米机关炮，射界十分开阔，不过仅有最初服役的三艘舰“尼古拉斯”、“奥班农”和“谢瓦利埃”号（Chevalier，DD-451）在完工时配备了这种武器，在战时改装时即被更换（ “谢瓦利埃”号在换装之前即战沉），后续舰在建造中就直接用40毫米机关炮替换。M2型12.7毫米高射机枪是战前美国海军的另一种标准轻型防空武器，重45.6公斤，使用110发弹链供弹，射速550-700发/分，最大射程6770米，最大射高4570米。“弗莱彻”级计划安装4挺12.7毫米机枪，分别位于52号炮位后方两侧和舰体中部两舷，但没有一艘舰实际装备该型武器，当第一艘“弗莱彻”级驱逐舰服役时，12.7毫米机枪就已经被厄利孔20毫米机关炮代替了。\n在1941年底至1942年初，根据英国海军在欧洲水域的作战经验，美国海军意识到“弗莱彻”级的防空武器难以满足未来的防空作战需要，因此着手进行改进，更新武器，决定用两种舶来品 -- 博福斯40毫米机关炮和厄利孔20毫米机关炮 -- 取代落后的28毫米机关炮和12.7毫米机枪。瑞典博福斯公司设计的40毫米机关炮被公认为二战最优秀的小口径防空炮之一，它远渡重洋落户美国源于30年代末美国海军准备为性能不佳的28毫米机关炮研制替代武器，恰逢此时一位访欧归来的海军工程师报告说瑞典人设计了一种新型机关炮，性能优良，于是美国海军在1940年8月从博福斯公司购买了一座双联装40毫米机关炮进行测试，发现稳定性一流，火力连续持久，弹道性能出色，明显优于英美海军的同类装备，很快被确定为新一代标准中近程防空武器。此时太平洋上阴云密布，急不可耐的美国海军不待得到瑞典方面的许可，就从荷兰海军手中获得了相关图纸资料加以仿制，1941年6月才获得了博福斯公司授予的生产许可证，第一座双联装炮于1942年1月完成，更强劲的四联装炮也在三个月后研制成功，于同年夏天陆续装备美国海军舰艇。\n\n##

["同义词\n人论（人论）一般指人论：人类文化哲学导引（恩斯特‧卡西尔创作人学著作）\n\n《人论：人类文化哲学导引》是德国哲学家恩斯特‧卡西尔创作的人学著作，首次出版于1944年。\n在该书中，卡西尔从人的符号性存在入手，把人看成是“符号的动物”，并以其为出发点，勾勒了人性发展及人类文化的所有创造物——语言、历史、艺术、宗教、神话的整体构架。\n该书中认为：人只有在创造文化的活动中，才成为真正意义上的人，才能获得真正的“自由”；人的本质是永远处于制作之中的；人性并非是一种实体性的存在，而是自我塑造的一种过程。因而，“作为一个整体的人类文化，可以被称作为不断解放自身的历程”。\n\n该书的理论是西方人学理论的一次创新与突破。它标志着在探索人性的问题上，人学理论发展到了一个新阶段，无论是在人的哲学、文化哲学或历史哲学上，都具有深刻的理论意义和实践意义。\n\n## 内容简介\n\n这本书分为上下两篇，共12章。上篇（前5章）回答的是“人是什么”的问题。第一章回顾了两千多年来西方思想史关于人的问题的各种哲学主张。卡西尔认为在各种意见不一的关于人的主张背后，隐藏的是人类自我认识的危机；第二章卡西尔提出了他自己关于“人是符号的动物”的功能性定义；第三章论述了人与动物的根本区别；第四章从空间和时间两个最基本范畴入手，指出了人的符号力量就在于超越他有限存在的时空。第五章为上篇小结，指出人不像动物那样，只能被动接受直接给予的“事实”，而是生活在一种超越“事实”的“理想”世界之中。下篇（后7章）回答的是“人与文化”关系问题，即运用符号形式展开对人类世界各方面的考察。第六章为下篇的导引篇，卡西尔的“人是符号的动物”之定义表明的也是“人是文化的动物”。卡西尔认为，正因为对人和文化关系的这种理解，人们就能洞察人类活动各自的基本结构，并把这些活动理解为一个有机整体。第七章到第十一章，卡西尔从人类文化的各种现象——神话与宗教、语言、艺术、历史、科学等方面来论证了人的符号化活动的“产品”。第十二章为下篇的总结与结论。\n\n##

创作背景\n\n1933年，希特勒上台后，卡西尔毅然辞去汉堡大学校长职务，流亡英国、瑞典、美国等国，先后任教于牛津大学全灵学院、瑞典哥德堡大学及美国耶鲁大学和哥伦比亚大学。正是在任教期间英美哲学人士敦促下，卡西尔用英文撰写了《人论：人类文化哲学导引》，以之为《符号形式哲学》的提要，并于1944年由耶鲁大学出版社出版。\n\n## 作品思想\n\n卡西尔认为，人并没有与生俱来的抽象本质，也不具有亘古不变的永恒人性，其本质只存在于人不断创造文化产品的辛勤的工作过程之中。因此，人只有在不断创造文化产品的过程中才能变成真正意义上的人，才能获得严格意义上的自由。所以，对人进行研究必须从研究人类文化入手，而人的哲学也就相应地是一种文化哲学。这种哲学既要阐明“人是什么”，同时也要阐明人类不断进行的文化创造活动，这是一而二，二而一的问题。在苏格拉底、柏拉图、亚里士多德、马可·奥勒留，奥古斯丁、托马斯·阿奎那、帕斯卡尔、笛卡尔、布鲁诺、伽利略、莱布尼茨、斯宾诺莎、狄德罗、达尔文，丹纳、尼采、马克思、弗罗伊德、舍勒等古往今来大思想家考察人的诸方面所采取的角度、方式等所得出的结论的基础上，卡西尔指出，人的问题并未由于这些理论而得到解决；到了现代，虽然研究事实已经极为丰富，研究手段已经大大改善，分析能力也非常敏锐深刻，但人的问题却处于一团迷雾之中，因而陷入真正的危机。只有找出引导我们走出迷雾的捐路明灯，这种危机方能彻底解决。而这样做，首先就需要把人界定为符号的动物，以取代“人是理性动物”的定义，开辟通向文化研究之路，这样，人就成了利用符号进行文化创造的动物。\n关于人与动物的区别，卡西尔指出，这种区别是信号与符号的区别：在动物行为中存在相当复杂的信号系统，但后者只是物理世界的一部分，与人类符号化思想的基本特征相反；符号则是人类意义世界的一部分，具有普遍适用性和灵活多变性。动物只对信号作出条件反射，只有人才能通过其文化创造活动将信号转化成为有意义的符号。就人和动物所生活的这个世界而言，它虽然是同一个物理世界，但是，由于人类思维的符号化活动和符号对人类生活的决定作用，人获得了抽象的时空观念， 因而既开辟了新的求知道路，也使人的生活世界成为完全不同于动物的自然世界的世界。另一方面，符号与信号的区别，人的世界与动物世界的区别，实际上是“理想”与“事实”、“可能性”与“现实性”的区别：人总是生活在其理想世界之中，不停地向着可能性的领域迈进；动物则只能被动地接受直接给定的事实，永远无法超越现实的规定性。而这又是圃为人能够通过创造符号，创造出自己需要的理想世界；动物却只能根据物理世界现有的信号作出反应，永远不了解可能和理想是什么。\n卡西尔指出，上述区别是由人运用各种符号创造不同文化造成的：“人的突出的特征，人的与众不同的标志，既不是他的形而上学本性，也不是他的物理本性，而是人的工作。正是这种工作，正是这种人类活动的系统，规定并划定了人性的圆周。语言、神话，宗教、艺术，科学、历史，都是这个圆的组成部分和各个扇面。因此，一种，‘人的哲学’——定是这样一种哲学：它能使我们洞察这些人类活动各自的基本结构，同时也能使我们把这些活动理解成一个有机的整体”。在他看来，人的创造性工作怎样，人的本质，本性也就怎样；虽然人类所从事的语言，神话、宗教、艺术、科学等诸活动趋向不同的方向并遵循不同的原则，但这并不意味着它们不一致、不调和，相反，它们都向着“创造人自己的历史，创造一个文化世界”这个共同的目标迈进。这也就是说，人们在从事创造历史的活动过程中虽然其具体目标、过程、结果各不相同，但是他们所从事的都是能动自觉地创造各种“符号形式”的活动，都是走向把人本身塑造成“文化的人”这个总的根本目标的活动。因此，哲学所要研究的不是抽象的活动和抽象的人，而是这种具体能动的创造活动从及通过这种活动逐渐生成为“文化的人”的人。因此，人的哲学同时也就是科学的哲学、艺术的哲学，神话的哲学、语言的哲学，宗教的哲学和历史的哲学，亦即它们综合成为一个有机统一体的人类文化哲学，也可以说是哲学人类学。只有这样，哲学才能充分揭示人性的深度和广度，成为展示人类精神文化成长演化过程的史诗，而人的哲学、符号形式的哲学以及文化哲学也就是同一种哲学。\n\n## 作品影响\n\n《人论》一书是卡西尔人类文化哲学体系思想的代表作，对苏珊·桑塔格用符号学原理解释艺术和审美现象有着直接影响。\n\n## 作者简介\n\n恩斯特·卡西尔（1874—1945）， 犹太人，德国哲学家，20世纪新康德主义马堡学派的重要的代表人物之一，符号论美学的奠基人，主要著作有《符号形式的哲学》和《人论》。\n\ncopppy zi B1D2B1K2", "## 人论\n人论是基督教中讨论人的神学理论。\n##前言\n造人的传说，在创1：27中说：「神就照著自己的形象造人，乃是照著祂的形象造男造女。」又在2：7如此说：「耶和华神用地上的尘土造人，将生气吹在他鼻孔里，他就成了有灵的活人。」人是神所创造的，也是神的儿女。若以系统神学的角度来看，人论的范围除了探讨人的来源之外，也包括了人性的要素、灵魂的起源、人的良心和意志以及罪（人之变节状态）等部分。以下就经院哲学时期、宗教改革时期以及现代神学分别讨论安瑟伦、加尔文和布仁尔对人论的看法，借以明白在不同时期，对人的观念也有不同的转变。\n##安瑟伦\n安瑟伦（Anselm, 1033-1109)重新发表奥古斯丁的人论，他强调原罪的教义，并著重「原」（original）一字，并不是指著人类起源的事实，乃是指著目前事态中的个人事实。原罪也可以称之本性（自然）罪，虽然并非属于人的本性，但却说明了一个从创造以来罪进入的世界的情况。由于堕落，人成为有罪与污秽的，而罪由父遗传子孙，并原来所遗传的罪又加上个人后来所犯的罪，构成罪孽的本身。他认为人性在创造后堕落，背叛了神，如果亚当没有堕落，那么人性也就不会背叛，由父传给子的本性就会是圣洁，而不是罪性。\n他也讨论了罪与自由意志的关联：自由的一般定义，若是指一般犯罪或不犯罪的能力，并不恰当；天使有完全的道德自由，然而不能犯罪，不会犯罪。他主张，意志的本身没有受到外部的约束，始祖背道的行为的确是自发的，纯粹是出于自我意志，并非是真正的自由行动。人内在自由的被造只有一个选择，那就是圣洁，但要接受这个目的必须有一个内在的自我决定，而不是从外来的强迫。\n从他的「补赎说」也可看出他对人的看法，即神的公义是要求人类付出满足的代价，就像人类亏欠了必须偿还神的荣耀，但人类除非沉沦到地狱里，否则人性就无法恢复。所以基督为人类付出起初不顺服而欠神的债，基督耶稣在十字架上的死，就是在父神与子神耶稣基督之间，在衪的人性中的客观交易。\n因为除了神自己以外，没有人能够满足此赔偿；除了人自己以外，没有人应当作此支付。假设天国必须有人进入才得实现，假设我们必先支付罪的赔偿才能获准进入，假设只有神能作此支付，假设只有人类应当作此赔偿，显然必须有某人同时是神，也同时是人，才能作此支付。\n##加尔文\n加尔文（John Calvin, 1509-1564）在《基督教要义》中对人观的解说，主要可分为二大部分，即从创造者上帝来看人的受造，以及从基督的救赎来看人的堕落与拯救。在人的受造部分，他说：\n人是神的公义、智慧和良善的最高贵最显著的样本，……首先要知道，人既是为泥土所造的，就不当骄傲，……上帝不但以生命赋予泥土的器皿，而且以它为不朽之灵的居所，所以亚当很值得自豪，因为造物主对他如此地宽宏大量。\n人具有灵魂和肉体，这是无庸争论的事实。我所谓的「灵魂」是指那不朽，而属被造的本质，是人最高贵的部份。有时候它又称为「灵」（Spirit），虽然当这二个名词连用之时，它们的意义不同，可是若「灵」字分开用时，就与「灵魂」（Soul）一名词相同。……还有，人类心灵有许多高贵而属神的智能，可以证明灵魂有不朽的本质。\n他认为有一个切实的证据，可以证明灵魂的存在，即是：人是按照上帝的形像造的（创1：27）。上帝的光荣，虽然表现在人的外形上，可是他真正的形像，无疑的是在灵魂中。人在原初受造的状况是纯洁、高尚且有择善的自由意志的，但亚当受造的原初情形与今日我们的情形是非常不同的。加尔文根据圣经的堕落提出解释，他认为上帝禁止人吃分别善恶果子，乃是一种信心与服从的测验；他认为亚当的罪不但使本身面对死亡的咒诅，更成了普世受咒诅的来源，而这遗传的腐败就是「原罪」。\n凡出于败坏人性的，都得定罪。他也引用约3：6「从肉身生的，就是肉身」、罗8：6-7「体贴肉体的，就是死。原来体贴肉体的，就是与上帝为仇，因为不服上帝的律法，也是不能服。」说明在人心里，凡不是属灵的，就是属肉的。虽然在各时代，都有些人受天性的驱使，毕生至力于道德的追求，在这件事上，可以证明他们的本性还有若干纯洁，但他认为这些余留在人性中神的恩典，只是在人里面约束人的活动的恩典，不能完全掩饰自己的污秽；而这正显示救赎的工作是上帝独自作为的恩典，即是藉著衪独生子来到世界成为人的救赎者。\n因此上帝从来没有不经中保而对他古时的百姓表示慈祥，或叫他们有得著衪恩惠的希望的。…拯救只能求诸基督之完全了的赎罪祭。且基督被称为「上帝的形像」（西1：15）不是没有缘由的；这称号使我们知道，若非上帝藉著基督显现自己，我们就得不著那为得救所必须的对上帝的认识。\n##布仁尔\n布仁尔（Emil Brunner, 1889-1966）坚持神的形像在人性中，为实际之事，且认定人性中所存的灵性对我们传福音的启示，提供了一个接触点，使人有接受基督的可能；他也坚持神对一切的世人，多少启示了祂自己，他说：「只因为神要求人是属于祂的，人才算是人。」又说：「人之所以特别成为人，正是因为我们能听见上帝的话。…人之生存是由于神的道。神向人说话，呼召人在祂的道中存在。…这是说，即当我们顺著自己的意志决定离弃神，但神向人说话仍不止息。…上帝绝对没有向我们隐藏，只是那于我们得救最重要的神之道的真理被隐藏了。」\n在这个部份他用几个特别的名词来说明：如Ansprechbarkeit（英addressability），即是人性中存有神「向他说话的可能性」；Wortmaechtigkeit（英verbicompetence），即人有「说话的能力」；还有wortempfaengliches Wesen（英word-receptive being），称人为「能听话的人」。由此，他的见解是神能向人说话的可能性只是构成神的形像之外型，这外型与那充实这外型的内容，绝对分开。在人性中这外型完保存，只是其中的内容完全丧失。人性堕落后，完全失去了意志自由，人虽然还有理性，却失去了他为善或向善的能力。从外型看，人性中的神之形象并无损，但就实质说，人性中神之形象是完全丧失；人完全为罪人，人的心性中没有一点不被罪玷污。\n旧约中所谓人是「按照神的形象被造」意味著人不可能失去此形象，即使他们犯了罪，亦不能够失去此形象，因为此概念乃描述人的「形式」或「结构」层面；但新约提及人类「按照神的形象被造」的人性已经失丧，而且不是部份失丧，乃是整个失丧，不将荣耀归给神，反将荣耀归给人及被造物；人不但不活在神的爱中，反而寻求自我中心。人性不再拥有「神的形象」（Imago Dei），按该词「具体」的层面而言，与「在神的道中」同义，这意指人在其本身并未拥有真实的存有，乃是在神里面才拥有其真实的存有。\n由罪人的观点来看，「神的形象」是在道成肉身的耶稣基督里，惟有当人藉著信心「在耶稣基督里」时，才能够恢复「神的形象」，当人类进入神显现在基督里的爱，便成为真正的人，真正的人性并非源自全然发挥人的潜能，而是源自接受、领悟神自我彰显的爱。"],

文物历史\n\n墓葬被盗\n在山西省侯马市曲沃县所属地区有一个叫作曲村的小村庄。上世纪90年代以前，这座小村庄一直默默无闻。谁也没有想到，九代19位晋侯及其夫人已在这个小村庄的地下沉睡了2000多年。随着19座晋侯及其夫人墓的发现，证实了两千年前这里曾是晋国最早的都城。\n然而，当考古学家小心翼翼地揭开这些墓葬时，却发现已经有八座晋侯墓被盗，残余物凌乱地散在墓底。\n流落香港\n在考古学家痛惜这些失落的珍宝时，这座不起眼的小村庄却迅速地“著名”起来，不少文物走私者闻风而至，以高价收购这些被盗的珍贵文物，而这座村庄也因而迅速致富，被人称为“小香港”。在某位晋侯的墓地中随葬有一组精美的编钟，共有16件，可惜其中的一部分在正式的考古发掘之前，就被盗墓贼窃走，流落香港。\n当地的盗墓贼配备的不是洛阳铲这种传统工具，他们装备的是冲锋枪、炸药和越野车，坚固一些的墓室都是被炸药炸开的。他回到北大以后，同事们都劝他不要再去了，以免把命搭上。在盗匪横行的战乱年代出现这种情况也许我们还会理解，可考古人员遇到这批盗墓贼的时候只是十年前，可以想象一下，那时当地的政府已经腐败到了什么程度。直到前几年，侯马市抓捕了一批盗墓分子，枪毙了几个，当地的一些政府官员也与此案牵连被处理，才总算有所好转。\n香港寻宝\n20世纪50年代中期，马承源和他的同事到处征集文物。而马承源每一次到香港，都要逛古玩街。一次，他在美国好友范季融先生陪同下来到古玩街，在一家小店橱窗里看到一只鼎，不觉眼睛一亮。取出来一看，虽然表面土锈甚多，但从锈迹斑斑的铭文中，“晋侯”二字依稀可辨。上博馆藏的青铜宝鼎也有不少，但眼前的这一件可不是一般的东西，他反复地观看，似乎有点爱不释手。但当时马承源身上的港币已不多了，范先生见状，料定这是一件非同一般的文物，就讯问店主美国信用卡是否可用，在划卡成功后就将此鼎买下，随手交给马承源，捐给上海博物馆了。他们回到上海，经过清洗去锈，鼎身现出了43字铭文。这件西周中期(前11世纪末—前10世纪末)鼎是晋侯因军功而赠给下属的一件器物，其铭文记载的是晋侯命令他去追击来犯之敌，战成后为此赏赐成套的兵器及十朋贝。西周时代铸铭晋器在此之前基本上没有发现过，此鼎便成为当时发现的西周中期铸有长篇铭文的惟一的晋器，弥足珍贵。\n又一天，也是在这条古玩街上，马承源和香港朋友看到一家古玩肆里有一件古玩，不禁怦然心动，取出来细细观摩——这不正是春秋时期吴王夫差的用品吗？夫差在位22年，传世的遗物仅20多件，且大多是剑、戈等兵器，像这样的礼器从来没有见过。此时马承源没有钱，就关照古董商不得转手，过几天会把钱汇来买下。可是，回到上海后一时还是筹不到这么多钱。马承源心如火焚，无奈之下告诉了香港工商巨子何鸿章。何先生慷慨相助，买了下来赠给上博。后来发现器具上还有12字铭文。原来，此物是吴王夫差用诸侯进贡的青铜为西施铸造的。\n买回运至上海\n1992年，香港中文大学张光裕教授那里传出一条信息，即香港文物市场上有一套14件的编钟，钟上的铭文是凿刻的，这属于比较特殊的情况，当地某些博物馆和收藏家都不敢轻易出手，认为有伪造之嫌。当1994年照片和铭文传到了上海后，马承源凭他多年研究青铜器的经验，根据仅有的资料，断定是真品，毅然决定抢救回沪，用重金从香港将流落在外的晋侯编钟购回。马承源说：“我当时马上告诉香港这个古玩店，‘这14件钟，你不要给别人看古玩行有这个规矩，给人看了以后，只有不要了以后，才可以给第二个人看。’我跟我的同事们商量一下，这套钟是了不得的东西，我们赶紧要把它寄回来。大概寄了十二三个箱子，装的大箱，装回来了，装到上海博物馆。打开一看，这确实是非常早的晋侯墓编钟。”从此，晋侯苏编钟成了上海博物馆的镇馆之宝。\n\n## 文物特征\n\n其共2件。一件高25.9厘米，铣间距14.9厘米；另一件高22.3厘米，铣间距12.9厘米。该编钟总计16件，其余14件由上海博物馆从境外购回入藏。编钟分两组，三种式样，非同时铸造，测音却和谐，是标准配律。16件钟上共刻有355字的长篇铭文，完整记录了西周厉王三十三年，晋侯苏率军参加周厉王亲自指挥的讨伐东夷的战争。晋侯苏因战功，多次受赏，因作此编钟。\n\n##

文物历史\n\n1992年8月，晋侯墓地8号墓遭到盗掘，大量随葬品被盗往国外，其中有14枚流落到香港古玩肆中；\n10月，北京大学考古系与山西省考古研究所联合发掘了被盗的8号墓，出土了刻有铭文的两枚甬钟，铭文分别为“年无疆子子孙孙”、“永宝兹钟”\n；12月，上海博物馆馆长马承源先生在香港中文大学张光裕教授的帮助下斥巨资将14枚编钟买回。经过与晋侯墓地考古出土的两枚编钟对比，它们的价值得以确认。\n\n1993年4月，马承源邀请长期主持翼城与曲沃交界处的天马——曲村遗址发掘工作的邹衡先生，带着8号墓的图文资料到上海博物馆观摩14枚钟。\n\n2009年，范季融夫妇将其中一枚甬钟赠给国家文物局。\n\n## 文物特征\n\n西周晋侯苏钟共16枚，编钟分两组，三种式样，每组8枚，均大小成编,一组即一肆。大钟为一组，高分别为49、49.8、52、44.7、32.7、30、25.3、22厘米，纹饰浅而细，小型为一组，高分别为50、49.5、51、47.6、34.8、29.9、25.9、22.3厘米。\n\n编钟铭文\n根据马承源先生考释，得16段编钟铭文，以编钟序号为序，现采录如下：\n（1）惟王卅又三年，王亲遹省东国南国。正月既生霸戊午，王步自宗周。二月既望癸卯，王入格成周。二月（2）既死霸壬寅，王偿往东。三月方死霸，王至于

文物鉴赏\n\n西周晋侯苏钟第一组为大钟，纹饰浅而细，第二组为中小型钟，纹饰深而阔。并且从造型上来讲两组也有细微的差异，研究者认为它们虽并非同时铸造，但音律却非常和谐。钟上铭文为利器刻凿而成，笔画转折处要分四五刀或是五六刀的接连刻凿，笔道才能连起来，刀痕至今非常明显。\n\n## 文物价值\n\n西周晋侯苏钟铭文全部为錾刻，西周青铜器首见，铭文完整记录了西周山西博物院周厉王三十三年，晋侯苏率军参加周厉王亲自指挥的讨伐东夷的战争。晋侯苏因战功，多次受赏，因作此编钟。所记战争为史料所阙载，对研究西周和晋国历史极为重要。\n\n## 出土环境\n\n西周晋侯苏钟出土于山西省曲沃县北赵村晋候墓地8号墓，曲沃北山位于晋候墓地8号墓北面。北山为太行山余脉，由东向西，山势逐渐降低，分为塔儿山、乔山和垆顶山。晋侯墓地就处于中部乔山南麓10公里开外的山前地带。墓地以南地势逐渐下降，在毛张村南的滏河河谷降至最低点，滏河为季节性河流，由西北向西南绕天马-曲村遗址，在西北约25公里处汇入汾河。在滏河南面，横亘着一道叫峨眉岭的土梁，土梁后的曲沃南山依稀可见。墓地背山面水，远山相对，视野开阔，地望颇佳。\n\n## 重要展览\n\n2002年，上海博物馆将藏于四地的5件晋侯苏鼎、两地16枚晋侯苏钟等铜器集中起来参加晋侯墓地出土青铜器展览 。\n\n## 文物争议\n\n西周晋侯苏钟铭文记时历日者有以下六条：唯王三十又三年，正月既生霸戊午，二月既望癸卯，二月既死霸壬寅，三月旁死霸，六月初吉戊寅、丁亥、庚寅。为研究西周纪年提供了实物资料。问题出在西周晚期周王在位过了三十又三年只有厉王和宣王，某王三十又三年晋侯苏讨伐夙夷是绝对真实的事，《史记》之《晋世家》及《十二诸侯年表》记载，晋献侯在位的时间为周宣王六年到十六年，即前822到前812年，若三十三年为宣王的三十三年，晋侯苏已然死去多年了，若为厉王三十三年，那时晋侯苏还没有即位，争论便由此而起。邹衡认为，8号墓的年代上限为周宣王三十三年，晋侯苏只能是晋穆侯，晋献侯名“苏”应是《世本》的错误；马承源说，铭文中的二月癸卯和壬寅两个日干是当时的刻手倒置所致，如果将两者对调一下，其记时合于厉王三十三年，并指出《晋世家》所载晋侯苏在位为宣王时有误，司马迁对晋侯世次的记载亦未必可靠；李学勤相信三十三年就是厉王三十三年，其时苏以靖侯孙的身份率兵打仗，编钟系随厉王作战时的战利品，铭文是苏即侯位后所刻，故称号也依刻字时的身份而改变，假设的成分太多了；王占奎从有关千亩之战的年份和成师的年龄中找出了《史记》的矛盾，以及殇叔在位4年可能是误算所致，提出了西周纪年中宣王纪年可能是从元年到六十年，而不存在共和单独14年的新说后，认为三十三年是共和元年（前841年）以来的第33年（前809年），司马迁所言“自靖侯以来，年纪可推”应该是可信的，只是在推算的过程中有小误而已；夏商周断代工程公布的《夏商周年表》，确定为厉王三十三年，即前845年。\n\n##

Хууль）为蒙古国制定的宪法，“我们蒙古人民以巩固国家的独立、主权，崇尚人权、自由、正义和国家统一，珍惜和继承立国典章、历史与文化传统，尊重人类文明成果，在我国建立和发展人道的、公民民主的社会为崇高目标，谨向大众宣布蒙古国宪法。”## 历史背景\n\n蒙古历史上共产生过四部宪法。1911年外蒙古独立，成立大蒙古国。1915年，《中俄蒙协约》签订，外蒙古在中华民国内实行自治，中华民国享有对外蒙古的宗主权。1919年，中华民国派徐树铮率军占领京都库伦，外蒙古被迫取消自治。1921年，外蒙古再次宣布独立，成立了君主立宪制的蒙古人民革命政府。\n1924年6月3日，蒙古废除了君主立宪制。同年8月，蒙古人民革命党第三次代表大会通过了蒙古人民共和国走非资本主义道路的总路线。1924年11月26日，在库伦举行了国家大呼拉尔第一次会议，通过了蒙古历史上的第一部宪法《蒙古人民共和国宪法》，宣布成立蒙古人民共和国，且将首都京都库伦更名为乌兰巴托。\n1940年6月，国家大呼拉尔第八次会议，通过了蒙古历史上的第二部宪法《蒙古人民共和国宪法》。\n1945年2月，苏联、美国、英国签订了《雅尔塔协定》规定“外蒙古的现状须予维持”，并将其作为苏联对日本作战的条件之一。1945年8月，经过公民投票之后，蒙古正式宣布从中国脱离，中华民国国民政府于1946年1月正式承认蒙古独立。1951年2月，大人民呼拉尔举行第一次选举。\n1960年7月6日，第四届大人民呼拉尔第一次会议通过了蒙古历史上的第三部宪法《蒙古人民共和国宪法》。该宪法后经多次修改。该宪法共有10章94条，其中规定，蒙古人民共和国是工人、合作化阿拉特（农牧民）和劳动知识分子的社会主义国家，基础是工人阶级同合作化阿拉特的联盟。蒙古人民革命党是蒙古人民共和国国家和社会的领导力量。大人民呼拉尔行使立法权和国家的一切权力，这些权力包括：批准和修改宪法；制定法律；制定内外政策的基本原则和措施；选举大人民呼拉尔主席团；组成部长会议（国家权力的最高执行机关，对大人民呼拉尔及大人民呼拉尔主席团负责）；批准成立、撤销、组成各部和其他主管机关；选举组成蒙古人民共和国最高法院，任命国家检察长。从第十届大人民呼拉尔起，每届大人民呼拉尔的任期由四年延长为五年。\n1989年12月，蒙古人民共和国首个反对派组织——蒙古民主联盟成立，随后十多个反对派组织先后成立，它们组织集会、游行、绝食，要求蒙古人民革命党和政府集体辞职，解散大人民呼拉尔，修改宪法，实行多党制和议会制等等。蒙古人民革命党遂提前召开了中央全会和大人民呼拉尔会议，彻底改组了党的中央政治局和书记处，将党和国家领导人全部撤换，取消了宪法内有关蒙古人民革命党的领导作用的条款。1990年5月，蒙古人民共和国颁布了《政党法》，使反对党获得合法化。1991年1月，通过了《政党法》的修正案，要求各单位的蒙古人民革命党组织必须在1991年7月1日之前解散，党员编入所居住地区的街道支部。1990年7月，蒙古历史上的第一次多党选举举行，蒙古人民革命党获胜，继续为执政党。\n1990年3月，第十一届大人民呼拉尔第八次会议决定设立“总统”职位，故对《蒙古人民共和国宪法》的有关条款进行了修改。1990年9月3日，蒙古第一次直接总统选举举行，蒙古人民共和国选出了首位总统彭萨勒玛·奥其尔巴特。\n1992年1月13日通过，同年2月12日生效的《蒙古国宪法》是蒙古历史上第四部宪法。根据该宪法，自1992年2月12日起，蒙古的国名改为“蒙古国”。宪法确定蒙古国实行设有总统的议会制。宪法规定，蒙古国是独立主权的共和国，崇高目标是在国内建立人道主义的公民民主社会；在未颁布法律的情况下，禁止外国军事力量驻扎于蒙古国领土；国家承认公有制和私有制的一切形式；国家尊重宗教，宗教崇尚国家；公民有信仰和不信仰宗教的自由。宪法生效后，彭萨勒玛·奥其尔巴特继续担任蒙古国总统。1997年5月18日，蒙古第二次直接总统选举举行，蒙古人民革命党总统候选人那楚克·巴嘎班迪当选为第二任总统。这是《蒙古国宪法》生效后首次举行的总统选举。\n\n##

{"name": "文心雕龙·通变", "documents": ["# 文心雕龙·通变\n\n南朝刘勰创作的作品\n\n《通变》是《文心雕龙》的第二十九篇，论述文学创作的继承和革新问题。“变则其久，通则不乏。”这是文学艺术的一条发展规律。本篇能从“通”和“变”的辩证关系来论述继承和革新的不可偏废，这是可取的；刘勰针对当时“从质及讹”、“竞今疏古”的创作倾向，提出“还宗经诰”的主张，这在当时也是必要的。## 内容提要\n\n全篇分四部分。第一部分讲“通”和“变”的必要。刘勰认为各种文体的基本写作原理是有一定的，但“文辞气力”等表现方法却不断发展变化着；因此，文学创作对有定的原理要有所继承，对无定的方法要有所革新。第二部分就魏晋以前历代作家作品的发展情况，来说明文学史上承前启后的关系，强调继承与革新应该并重。第三部分是紧接上面主张“宗经”的思想来论述的。刘勰举枚乘、司马相如等五家作品沿袭的情形，一以说明通变的方法，一以表示忽于“宗经”而在“夸张声貌”上“循环相因”，就出现了“广寓极状，而五家如一”的情形。第四部分讲通变的方法和要求，提出必须结合作者自己的气质和思想感情，来继承前人和趋时变新，文学创作才能有长远的发展。\n刘勰所讲的“通”和“变”都过于狭窄：文学创作所应继承的，显然主要还不在诗、赋、书、记等文体的写作特点；而要发展革新的，也不仅仅是“文辞气力”等表现方法。他未能认识到古代文学作品中一切优秀的内容和形式、思想和技巧，都有根据新的条件而加以继承和发展的必要，这就使他的通变论带有较大的片面性。\n\n## 原文\n\n（一）\n夫设文之体有常1，变文之数无方2。何以明其然耶3？凡诗、赋、书、记4，名理相因5，此有常之体也；文辞气力6，通变则久7，此无方之数也。名理有常，体必资于故实8；通变无方，数必酌于新声9：故能骋无穷之路，饮不竭之源。然绠短者衔渴10，足疲者辍涂11；非文理之数尽12，乃通变之术疏耳13。故论文之方，譬诸草木：根干丽土而同性14，臭味晞阳而异品矣15。\n\n## 译文\n\n作品的体裁是有一定的，但写作时的变化却是无限的。怎么知道是这样的呢？如诗歌、辞赋，书札、奏记等等，名称和写作的道理都有所继承，这说明体裁是一定的；至于文辞的气势和感染力，惟有推陈出新才能永久流传，这说明变化是无限的。名称和写作道理有定，所以体裁方面必须借鉴过去的著作；推陈出新就无限量，所以在方法上应该研究新兴的作品。这样，就能在文艺领域内驰骋自如，左右逢源。不过，汲水的绳子太短的人，就会因打不到水而口渴；脚力软弱的人，也将半途而废。其实这并不是写作方法本身有所欠缺，只是不善于推陈出新罢了。所以讲到创作，就好像草木似的：根干附着于土地，乃是它们共同的性质；但由于枝叶所受阳光的变化，同样的草木就会有不同的品种了。\n\n## 注释\n\n1 体：体裁。常：恒常。\n2 数：方法。无方：即无常。《礼记·檀弓上》：“左右就养无方。”郑注：“方：犹常也。”\n3 然：如此。\n4 书、记：两种文体名。书：书札、信函。记：指下对上的奏记、笺记。参看《书记》篇。\n5 名：指文体的名称。理：指各种文体的基本写作原理。如《明诗》篇所说“诗言志”、诗者，持也，持人情性”等，《诠赋》篇所说“赋者，铺也，铺采摛文，体物写志也”等。\n6 气：指作品的气势。力：指作品的感人力量。\n7 通：指创作的继承方面。变：指创作的革新方面。《周易·系辞下》：“变则通，通则久。”\n8 资：凭借、借鉴。故实：指过去的作品。\n9 酌：斟酌。新声：新的音乐，这里借指新的作品。\n10 绠（gěng耿）：汲水用的绳子。衔渴：即口渴。衔：含在口中。\n11 辍（chuò龊）：停止。涂：路途。\n12 文理：写作的道理。\n13 疏：粗疏，不精通。\n14 丽：附着。\n15 臭味：指气类相同。《左传·襄公八年》载季武子的话：“今譬于草木，寡君在君，君之臭味也。”杜注：“言同类。”晞（xī西）：晒。\n（二）\n是以九代咏歌1，志合文则2：黄歌《断竹》3，质之至也4；唐歌《在昔》5，则广于黄世6；虞歌《卿云》7，则文于唐时；夏歌《雕墙》8，缛于虞代9；商周篇什10，丽于夏年。至于序志述时11，其揆一也12。暨楚之骚文13，矩式周人14；汉之赋颂，影写楚世15；魏之策制16，顾慕汉风17；晋之辞章，瞻望魏采18。榷而论之19，则黄唐淳而质20，虞夏质而辨21，商周丽而雅，楚汉侈而艳22，魏晋浅而绮23，宋初讹而新24：从质及讹，弥近弥澹25。何则？竞今疏古，风味气衰也26。今才颖之士27，刻意学文，多略汉篇，师范宋集28；虽古今备阅29，然近附而远疏矣30。夫青生于蓝31，绛生于茜32，虽逾本色33，不能复化。桓君山云34：“予见新进丽文，美而无采；及见刘、扬言辞35，常辄有得。”此其验也。故练青濯绛36，必归蓝茜；矫讹翻浅37，还宗经诰38。斯斟酌乎质文之间，而檃括乎雅俗之际39，可与言通变矣。\n〔译文〕\n所以过去几个朝代的诗歌，在情志的表达上是符合于写作法则的。黄帝时的《弹歌》，是非常朴质的了。唐尧时的《在昔歌》，比黄帝时有所发展。虞舜时的《卿云歌》，文采较唐尧时为多。夏代的《五子之歌》，比虞舜时文采更丰富。商周两代的诗篇，较夏代又华丽得多。这些作品在述情志、写时世上，其原则是一致的。后来楚国的骚体作品，以周代诗篇为模范。汉代的辞赋和颂，却又学习《楚辞》。魏国的诗篇，大多崇拜汉代风尚。晋代的作品，又钦仰魏人的文采。把这些情况商讨一下，可以看出：黄帝和唐尧时候的作品是淳厚而朴素的，虞夏两代的作品是朴素而鲜明的，商周时期的作品是华丽而雅正的，楚国和汉代的作品是铺张而尚辞采的，魏晋两代的作品不免浅薄而靡丽，刘宋初年的作品更是不切实际而过分新奇。从朴素到不切实际，越到后来越乏味。为什么呢？因为作家们都争着模仿近代作品，而忽视向古人学习，所以文坛上的风气就日益衰落了。目前一些有才华的人，都努力于学习写作，可是他们不注意汉代的篇章，却去学习刘宋时的作品；虽然他们对历代创作都同样浏览，但总不免重视后代而忽视古人。青色从蓝草中提炼出来，赤色从茜草中提炼出来；虽然这两种颜色都超过了原来的草，但是它们却无法再变化了。桓谭曾说：“我看到新进作家的华丽的文章，虽然写得很美，却没有什么可采取的；但是看到刘向、扬雄的作品，却常常有所收获。”这话可以说明上述的道理。所以提炼青色和赤色，一定离不开蓝草和茜草；而要纠正文章的不切实际和浅薄，也还要学习经书。如能在朴素和文采之间斟酌尽善，在雅正与庸俗之间考虑恰当，那么就能理解文章的继承与革新了。\n〔注释〕\n1

文心雕龙·通变\n是《文心雕龙》卷五第二十九篇，又或作是第三十一篇101-103，是六观说的其中之一，是《文心雕龙》中「割情析采」的一篇，作者是刘勰。学者们大致认为刘勰是为了批评当时文坛上的不良风气而写p=126，是《文心雕龙》理论体系中的一个重要观点刘渼。范文澜评价「通变」为：「读《文心》当知祟自然、贵通变，虽谓为全书精神也可」，可见其重要性143。刘勰在此文中表达了他的文学发展观，是文心雕龙学的一个重要研究范围。p=125\n篇可以大致分为四段。第一段中指出了出文章有两个方面，分别是以诗歌、辞赋、书札、奏记等体裁「有常之体」以及是「文辞气力」等两个方面。第二段分别评论了历代的文风，指出后代文人虽然注意到取法于前代，但是文风总是趋向华美。刘勰认为商周之前的文章都以质朴为主，但是商周之后的文章则以艳丽新奇为主，并认为当时文人之所以作出新奇的文章是因为注意学习刘宋的文章是忽略汉代的篇章所致的。第三段中，指出了汉代枚乘等五家描写夸张事物的辞句，以描写夸张的手法是有限的。第四段中，说明了写作文章应该以先以阅读为主，然后再去抓住当中的大纲，并以自己的情志和文气以写作。\n学者对于通变篇本身和其衍生的「通变」论展开了深入的探讨。在文化背景方面，通变受到《周易》的影响非常深远，但是其他典籍都有对于通变的形式构成了影响。学界对于通变的主旨大致上可以分为「复古」、「常变」、「新变」、「继承革新」、「会通适变」五派，而各派之中学者的理解又另有分歧。\n## 内容概要\n虽然文体体裁虽然有常规的，但是文辞和文情的变化是无穷的。无论是诗歌、辞赋、书札、奏记也好，其创作的方式都是相同的，历代承袭。「文辞气力」要「通变」才可以流传下去，说明「通变」是不固定的。「名」和「理」规格是有一定的，故此要参考古人的作品。「通变」的方式是无限的，需要在创新的作品中吸取经验。按照这些方法，就能不停写出文章，在文坛上如鱼得水。然而井绳太短的人就会喝不了水，走得累的人就会半途而废，写不出好文章的人，只不过是不会「通变之术」，而不是写作方法的有限。因此，讨论作文章的方法就像是种植花草，虽植物都会依附着泥士，但是吸收阳光的不同会引起品种之间的相异。\n在过去九个朝代的作品「九代咏歌」，是合乎创作的法则的。他认为，黄帝时的《断竹》行文朴实，尧虞的《在昔》一曲有所发展，而虞舜的《卿云歌》更有文采。接着夏朝的「雕墙」更为繁富，商周的诗歌则更为华丽。但是，本则上他们抒情言志的方式是一致的。相反，楚骚模仿周朝文章，然后汉朝的赋和颂都模仿楚国的作品，魏国的作品由慕效汉代，魏国的作品被晋朝人所参考。究其原因，黄帝和唐尧年代的作品淳厚而质朴，虞舜和夏朝的作品质朴而典雅、楚国和汉朝的作品铺张而艳丽、刘宋初年的作品讹滥而新奇。由质朴到新奇，这是为什么？祟尚时尚而疏忽了古典的作品，于是感染力不强，而文气衰弱。现在一些有才学的文人虽然努力写作，但是大多忽略了汉代的作品，而参考刘宋的作品。即使是博览古今作品也好，只重视后代文章而忽视了古人的话，就像青出于蓝一样青色虽出于蓝草，但是青色却缺乏再变化的能力了。桓谭说：「我见新进作家的文章，美丽而没有文采；我见了刘向扬雄的文章，经常都有得益。」这句话说得甚有道理。提练青色濯取必定要依靠青草；濯取红色必定要依靠茜草，要纠正文章的讹误、浅薄之处，依然要在经典中学习。只要可以在朴素和文采之间取得平衡，在雅俗之间调整，这些人便是理解「通变」了。\n夸张的描写手法，到汉朝初期已经到达极点了「夸张声貌」。在此之后，循环因袭，即使有高飞出旧的范围也好，结果都落入先人的牢笼中。枚乘的《七发》说：「遥望东海，与苍天相连」。司马相如的《上林赋》说：「望起来望不了尽头，看起来看不了边际，太阳从东方的水中升起，明月从西边的高山出现」。马融的《广成颂》：「天地相连，本来没有边际，太阳出于东方，月亮出于西出」。扬雄的《羽猎赋》：「太阳月亮升起又落下，天地融合为一」。张衡的《西京赋》：「太阳和月亮在这里升起落下，就像是扶桑和蒙汜一样」。这些夸张描写景物的手法，五位作家其实都差不多，是互相相乘的，既有继承也有革新，这才是「通变」的正确方法。\n因此，在写作文章的时候应候，应该注意这数个方面。写作时应该先广泛阅读书籍并找寻要领，融会贯通，找寻自己的文风。并以自己的真实情感以「会通」，并从自己的气质进行适应变革，而不应该局限于偏激的看法。刘勰又再以名家以夸张法描写事物作为例子。\n文末最后又留下赞（评论），认为写作的法则是每天不停变化的。变化才可以持久，继承才不会缺乏。应该果断地适应时代变化，同时应该抓着机会，看准现今文坛风气创出优秀作品，同时参考古人的文章来定立写作法则。詹锳\n### 理解分歧\n####「夸张声貌」\n在通变中，刘勰举出了汉赋的例子以说明「通变」，纪昀、范文澜、刘永济、王运熙认为刘勰所举出的例子以说明作家在具体的艺术描写中也有「通」和「变」的因素存在，是正面的肯定；但是陆侃如、牟世金、詹福瑞认为这个例子是反面否定了「因革」，没有创新变化。p=191\n有学者从正面的角度理解汉赋例子。纪昀认为：「此段首言佳篇，虽巨手不能凌越：以见汉篇之当师，非教人以因袭。宜善会之」，他认为这个例子是说明好的文章即使是佳手也不能超越的，认为文人不应该抄袭，而是体会其中的奥义。范文澜说：「彦和（刘勰）虽举此五家为例，然非教人屋下架屋，模拟取笑也」。刘永济认为「至举后文例相循者五家，正示人以通变之术，非教人模拟古人之文也」。大致这些评论者认为所举例子说为了说明通变的方法，不是单纯抄袭，而是有所变化。p=191-192\n但是也有学者从负面的角度理解例子，陆侃如、牟世金认为刘勰这五例是为了说「竞今疏古」的后果，是说明「文则」说（合乎创作的法则）的正确，以批评「竞今疏古」的后果。詹福瑞也认为，他的例子是希望对应上「文辞气力」的部份，以说明刘勰不满意对于「制奇」时反而因此因循守旧的，然后他紧接提出了正面的主张「参伍因革，通变之数也」同样地，韩泉欣指出刘勰提及汉赋例子是一种「鄙弃」的态度。p=191-192\n有学者认为这是刘勰举例不当而引致理解各异。詹锳认为，这个例子中没有说明出通变是包含了革新、继承、创作三者，没有显出创作的因素出来p=1100。周兴陆认为刘勰虽然不是否定「夸张声貌」，但是刘勰在《夸饰》篇中己经批评了司马相如「诡滥过甚」，扬雄、张衡「虚用滥形」，不认为他会以此作为正面的例子。他认为刘氏指出此例是为了批评这些人的创新并不足够，不应单纯向近代人学习，而是同时应该「还宗经诰」。\n####「九代咏歌」\n「九代」借代的朝代有所争议。周振甫、郭晋稀认是实指黄、唐、虞、夏、商、周、汉、魏、晋九个朝代；范文澜、陆侃如、牟世金、李曰刚李曰刚认为九代指的是黄、唐、虞、夏、商、周（楚）、汉、魏、晋（宋初）； 张长青、张会恩认为“九代”包括唐、虞、夏、商、周、汉、魏、晋、宋；北京师范大学中文系出版的《中国古代文论选注》中认为“九代”包括黄、唐、夏、商、周（楚）、汉、魏、晋、宋。争议点主要是在楚是独立出一个时代或者是并入周、汉之外，或者是合称之，和刘宋应该是并入晋代，又或者九代不包括刘宋。之所以各家理解有别，是因为「黄唐断竹」至「瞻至魏采」没有描写了刘宋，但是「黄唐淳而质」一句则有之。再者，在《才略》中出现的「九代之文」，以及和《时序》的「蔚映十代」是否一致。\n而「宋初讹而新」针对一句，较多的学者认为这是一种批评的态度。寇效信认为，刘氏对于黄至周的诗歌是肯定的，而批判楚、汉、魏、晋、宋的诗歌。韩泉欣认为，刘勰的评价中否定了宋齐文学。孙蓉蓉从《明诗》篇中刘勰对于宋齐山水诗的认可，指出他虽然不满意宋齐文学，但却不是完全的否定，而是指出其虽然怪诞而新奇，而却有其创新的意义。p=194-197\n## 思想背景\n「通变」的理论最早出自于《周易》之中，也是其基本思想唐辉，而故此学者经常从《周易》中找《文心雕龙·通变》的渊源。从其原始意思来说，「通」指的是门一开一合的意思，「变」则是往来不动的意思。p=201《周易·系辞上》和《系辞下》表明了《周易》的意蕴和作用，并认为《周易》是「通变」一词反映了宇宙万物的变化，认为人们应该掌握变化的规律，顺应变化而通达。故此《系辞》提出了「通变」、「通其变」、「变通」、「变而通之」等等的主张，将「通」和「变」相提讨论p=189。\n学者对于通变篇是否来自于《易经》中的「通变」有不同的看法，大多数学者都认为通变一篇是在自于《易经》。如唐辉认为刘勰将易学的通变思想引入进了文学之中，《易经》的通变思想也为具体的文学创作提供了理论和文化背景支持，有支持文学创新的意义。但是，李逸津不认为通变是出自于「穷则变，变则通，通则久」的学说，认为《易经》中的「通」是「通畅」、「通达」的意思，但是刘勰的「通」是修正时人一昧说「通」的修正，认为和《易经》所说的，先有「变」，然后有「通」并不相同。\n学者对于《易经》中「通变」的意义，以及是延申至文论区域时有不同的理解。吴建民对于《易经》中的「通变」作出了分析，认为《易经》谓「穷则变，变则通，通则久」，即是指「继承和革新」。而刘勰的文学观点也和《周易》的论点一致，认为只有万物只有「通其变」才能其变才能生生不息，而文学也一样要「通其变」才能「日新其业」，两者的道理是相通的吴建民。孙蓉蓉和高文强都认为，《易经》中的「通变」意指「通晓事物的变化」，「变通」意指「事物因变化而得以通达」，意指因事物的变化通达因而得以发展。孙蓉蓉 高文强认为，既然在《易经》中「通」是指「贯通」、「变」指的是「变化」，转移至文学的时候则不应该解作「继承和革新」。p=143-145孙蓉蓉则认为，探索《系辞》在追求「通变」原意当然重要，但是刘勰将「通变」概念移至文学时己经有所变化，不应该生搬硬套。p=189\n王晓玉在更大范围上探讨，她认为「通变」所蕴含的变早已于古人的「变」和观察中表现出来，在先民画夜四时中，政权更替，社会变革中都可以见到「常」和「变」的存在，故此刘勰的通变观也可能受这个更大层面上的影响。吴建民认为，《礼记·乐记》是首篇从社会历史发展角度考索文学的文章、而《乐记》和《毛诗序》都将诗乐的发展和社会的政治情况扣连起来，对于「通变」论的影响深远。詹锳和朱晓海都指出，在《公孙龙子》都已经有通变的篇章，詹锳更加补充在《孙子·九变》、《论衡·自纪》中都有提及过通变一词p=1075-1077\n在魏晋南北朝的文学家所创作的一些文学作品都对于通变有所影响，包括王弼、陆机、葛洪、萧统等。孙磊认为，王弼通过注《易经》以改变《易传》的通变思想，并在《明卦适变通爻》中提出了「因时适变」的观点。「因时适变」即指，在主体行为和客观形势两者之间对立时，主体可以依当时的环境进行合适的变化。而刘勰将它代入在文学之中，当外部环境对于文学创作起了影响的时候，可以依此调整文章的风貌，而刘勰对于文学发展和创作的理念即依靠其所支撑。在《文心雕龙札记》中，黄侃认为陆机在《文赋》谓「收百世之阙文，采千载之遗韵」正正是在说明「通变」。p=1077邱世友补充，虽然他说明了「通变」，但是没有将文学的继承和革新放于文学的发展上来考察，以致见解不成系统p=149。李侠认为《抱朴子外篇》对于《文心雕龙》的通变论也有所影响。在葛洪创作《抱朴子外篇》前，文论家如陆机等人也曾对文学的继承与创新等问题有过讨论，但看法片面或未成系统，而葛洪在进行了较为系统的讨论。葛洪在书中认为文学的发展是后胜于前，认为要同时重视古书的价值，今人应该吸收古书精华。但是，葛洪所强调的只是「新变」，而没有注意「通古」。刘勰相比之下分得更加清楚，认为文章的体裁，体要是不需要变的，而其他文辞和文情是需要变的，而对于文学传统的「讹变」并不应肯定。周勋初认为萧统在《文选序》中提出了艺术手法是随时代而发展的，不能持保守的态度，而这和「文律运周、日新其业」相似，可见他也提出了类似「通变」的学说p=1108。\n魏晋南北朝的文学背景对于通变也有所影响。吴予敏认为，当时的多元化政治经济使文化艺术多元，而重新奇的观念成为了当时的潮流。而这使刘勰这些受传统文学所影响的批评家有所不安。刘勰在表面上他将「通变」视为趋应时代的，翻陈出新的作文技巧。但是在深层意义上而言，「通变」关系到在不确定的写作技巧下掌握文学的创作法则。而孙敏强则认为，他的基本思想是为以经典、质朴的文学以弥补当时的清绮柔美的文学，而两者融合是他所追求的意义page=126。此外，当时儒家思想式微，学术气氛自由也是一个因素，当时的文人对美的追求产生了不少佳作，但是当时对于形式的过度追求也产生了追新猎奇的文风英语。邱世金认为，在当时文坛上出现了唯美的形式主义和消极的浪漫主义，他在《情采》和《序志》中批评了脱离了本道「宋初讹而新」的文学，指出了这种文学的危险性。他主张刘勰不是从经济和文化的角度提出了通变说，而是从文学的发展中强调脱离古籍的负面后果。故此刘勰只是将「疏古竞今」，士族官僚偏安江南过着奢侈糜烂的方式视作其中的次要因素。探原\n## 主旨\n学界对于「通变」的主旨上依然有所分歧，学界对于主旨的分类也各有分歧。何懿、王艳艳、高准山、高恒昱卓将其分为四派，包括「复古」说、「继承革新」说、「重在创新」说和「会通适变」说。而刘渼将「重在创新」说的「常变」说、「新变」说分作两派。刘渼，而童庆炳将「通变」的主旨说分作四派，没有说明「重在创新」而说明「常变」说。童庆炳-文集下文以「复古」说、「继承革新」说、「新变」说、「常变」说、「会通适变」说分而述之。\n「复古」说是最早出现、但也是最早淡出主流的看法，是学界达成共识放弃的学说王艳艳、高准山。其次，最被支持的学说是「继承革新」说，这派可以大致认为「通」指的是「继承」，「变」指的「革新」何懿。认为「通变」侧重的是「变」和「革新」的学者也不乏其人，但是在90年代之前，除了确认通变的涵义外，学者的认识都不够清楚王艳艳、高准山。而此派学说又可以大致分为「常变说」和「变新说」。而「会适通变」说是千禧前后在「变」和「革新」一派之间分离出来，渐渐独立自成一派王艳艳、高准山。\n### 「复古」说\n认为「通变」说指的是「复古」的主要有纪昀、黄侃，及后范文澜、郭绍虞等人都继承了这个观点。纪昀对于文心雕龙的评点共有三则，其中第一则中他从刘勰的时代所代入，认为齐梁时代文风绮靡，而刘勰提出通变矫正这种文风，也就是说通变是挽救时代而生的主张，而求新在这个充满庸俗文章的时代并不可行，故此应该复古。王怡云而黄侃在《文心雕龙札记》中认为「通变」篇的主旨是「示人勿为循俗之文，宜反之于古」，并认为汉赋的例子是为了说明文章是有范围的，就算是善于变化者都不能超出限制，是为了支持复古p=102。范文澜在《文心雕龙注》中也有引用他们二人的观点，并认同纪昀的说法，并认为虽然本篇虽是为了变新复古，但是当另作新声之时都需要参考古籍，缺一不可，故此其根本依然是复古原文：「此篇虽是旨在变新复古，而通变之术，要在资故实、酌新声两语，缺一则疏矣。」郭绍虞在《中国文学批评史》中则认为，刘勰的历史文学观和他人不同是在于批判了「求新于俗尚的新变，说明了通变的方法」，「完全以通变为复古」。\n但是，此说从1960年代文心雕龙学开始引入现代化理念和方法解释，此理论开始被放弃p=105。一般来说，台湾学者都不赞同「复古」说观点刘渼。改革开放的大潮下，有学者开始重新评价此观点，其中有部份学者批评此观点，但有些是从正面观点解释相关复古理论。王艳艳、高准山批评者有童庆炳、王少良等。王少良认为，「复古」是当时的思想认识上的不足，通变篇意在矫正文风，拯救文坛弊病的观点是显然的，而纪昀没有分清「复古」与「通变」手段和目的之间的关系。童庆炳认为，「复古」说「看似有理，但是实则偏颇过甚」，认为纪昀、黄侃的文学发展观念多在复古，故此将「通变」理解为「复古」不以为怪。胡继华认为，「复古」虽和「通变」论本身的制梏有关，但是以此理解则无视了通变论「趋慕新声」的说法，解释片面。刘永济认为，刘勰在开首处己经说明「资于故实、酌于新声」，在赞中说「文律日新」，认为「复古」说的看法不当。p=198\n然而，也有学者从正面角度解释「复古」说。叶继奋将刘勰的宗经思想和陈子昂、白居易、柳宗元等的文学复古思想作比较，认为刘勰的通变观是在孔子的文学思想中吸取养份以救时弊。王怡云以纪昀其他著作作考证，认为他在《治亭诗介序》中所提及的思想实际是认为文学是与时俱变的，而在《鹤街诗稿序》可见他认为「『根柢古人』是必要的，但是不能刻划古人而不能自为方圆」，认为纪昀的想法是否「复古」有所相榷。此外，刘绍谨则认为，刘勰的文学思想是复古主义的思想，刘勰的通变是「怎样在坚守宗经复古，秉持文学因离『圣人时代』愈来愈远而不断退化的同时,，面对不断变化的新思潮、新形式而适当取舍、损益、融会、发展的问题」，通变实际上是操作上的问题，而非理论概念。他认为通变的出现令刘勰的复古思想更为灵活。\n### 「继承革新」说\n在中国大陆，最多学者所支持的是「继承」和「革新」，是最被认可的学说，支持者有包括杨明照、马茂元、廖蔚卿、周振甫等。而在台湾，此派被称为 「复古」和「创新」，支持者有王更生等。刘渼\n首先提出此学说的中国大陆学者是马茂元何懿。在他1961年所发表的《说通变》之中指出，「复古」与「通变」不是一回事，认为刘氏的目的不是在复古，而是「情」「气」两者和词采统一以及将继承革新结合起来才是「通变」的精义所在。杨明照紧随之，在《文心雕龙校注拾遗》前言中认为，刘勰的文学史观是「继承和革新」，认为刘勰既尊重历史形式的文学理论，但是也会按根据现实的情况创新。詹锳在《刘勰和文心雕龙》中认为「穷则变，变则通，通则久」是《易经·系辞》中的一个重要晢学命题，而通变篇正正是使用了利用《易经》中「通」和「变」的关系以说明文学的历史发展。他认为，文学中日新月异的发展就是变，而在变之中不会变化的就是「通」，「通」和「变」的对立的统一。何懿李曰刚认为，刘勰的通变理论就是「通达穷涂（途），变化旧体」，而在当中「推陈出新」。而刘勰的理论在继承革新的观点而言，是「对立的统一，辩证之结合」。斯波六郎认为，「通是指与前人的作相通，也就是师古；变者时代之变化，即作者之创作」p=1078。他认为「参伍因革，通变之数也」中参伍就是指变，因革就是指通，依据的是《物色》篇中「莫不参伍以相变，因革以为功」的一句。认为范文澜、黄侃的理解不是刘勰所指的变的意思p=1078。孙蓉蓉认为，「通变」的词语虽然来自于《周易》，但是不能就此视为对「通变」一词的理解，认为不能生搬硬套，移植至文学时内涵会变为不同，以此认为应该「通变」应是「继承和革新」p=190-191。王运熙、杨明在《魏晋南北朝文学批评史》中解释「通变」原意为「事物有所变化而流通不滞」，认为刘勰将通变运用至文学时是指文章应该在继承传统的前提下作革新。\n但是，在继承革新说中，各派对于什么需要继承，什么需要革新依然有所分歧，具体以继承为重或者以变化为重上都存在分歧。张文勋、杜东枝在《文心雕龙简论》中认为刘勰要继承的是各种文体的格式法度，而「文辞气力」是需要革新的。缪俊杰、陆侃如、牟世金也则认为为要继承的是体裁名称和写作准则，而写作方法和文辞的感染力是需要革新的何懿。郭绍虞、王更生都认为刘勰既反对了「循环相因」，也反对了「近附而远疏」，主张的正是继承和革新，并指出只有继承而没有革新则文学无法发展；而只革新而不变化的话又必然落于贫乏，两者要互相补充。但是刘勰在「望今制奇」中指出「今」是变的出发点，两者之中以「变」较为重要p=1109李曰刚在《文心雕龙斠诠》中主张「通」指的是文章的风格、题材、文藻、辞气等是要求是不应该变化的，但是这些风格、题材等等等的表达方式是应该加以变化的。而诗文「叙事述时」是一成不变的通则，但是「情志事义」是应该加以变化的，然后在赞中点明文章应该同时继承和革新p=1365-1367。陆侃如、牟世金在《文心雕龙译注》认为「通变」就是「因革」，缪俊杰在《文心雕龙美学》中认为「通变」是继承和革新，大致相近。但是，陆侃如和牟世金认为应该是「通」「变」并重，但是缪俊杰认为应该是首先强调的是「通」，认为刘勰不是在强调革除古代圣贤的文章，而是革除淫靡之文。潘新华虽然认为通变指的是继承和革新，但他也认为通变的主旨应该在「变」之上。他引用《征圣》篇中的「抑引随时，变通会适，征之周孔，则文有师矣」，以及他多批评杨雄模仿他人作品而赞扬宋玉、枚乘等的首创作品，认为刘勰不是希望固守经典而没有变化，而只是借复古作为手段以矫正文风。而只要不违反宗经的原则，变是应该在在内容和形式上都加以创新。何懿\n有些学者并不同意「继承革新」的说法，如何懿、祖保泉等。何懿认为「通变」既然是出自于「穷则变，变则通，通则久」的，而此处的「变」是指「革新」，而「通」指的是「畅达，开通」，以「继承、革新」一词解释不合本义，而且从整书以「通变」合用的地方作继承革新解也不合切。祖保泉批评，有些论者抱着先入为主的心态，「脑子里先有个『继承和创新的对立统一」的观点，于是见到「通变」一词，便把那个观点填了进去。」，又指以「通指继承，变指创新」的方式解释原文有所不当，如「参伍因革，通变之数也」一句中，「参伍因革」已经有继承和革新的意思，而将后句「通变」亦作继承和革新则显得观点重复，可见「继承革新」并非刘勰的原意。祖\n### 「常变」说\n「常变」指是「通变」中同时有可以变的（变），同时也有不可以变的（常），刘永济和刘业超都主张此说。刘永济在《文心雕龙校释》中认为「通变」的主旨是「在穷变通久之理」，并认为「变」不是一切从旧或者是完全放弃旧说。指其当中有些是可以变，有些不可以变，「文辞气力」是可以变的，但是「诗辞书记」等文体方式是不能变化的。何懿\n刘业超认为，「变新」说或是「复古」说的说法都不符合客观事物发展的普遍规律，和历史实际情况不同，也和刘勰的思想有异。再者，刘勰「宗经」说法并不是单纯对于历史的「继承」，而是采取经典中的常则，因此「继承革新」的说法也不成立。他认为，刘勰的「通变」意在恢复历史上的文学规律，而同时在「文辞气力」之上给予自己的变化，认为「常变」的理解更合刘勰的原意。1460-1465\n### 「变新」说\n这一派的学者侧重在「变」、「革新」之上。在中国大陆，有吴圣昔、牟世金等。牟世金认为：「《通变》篇并非继承和革新的专论，强调文学的发展创新，才是刘勰『通变』论的主要思想，而本篇中『通变』之意，主要指『文辞气力』的发展创新」。他认为刘勰是侧重在文辞气力中的创新，但是同时指其也有一些局限性。田晓婧吴圣昔认为「决无变和不变的区别，一切都在变，一切都需变。这是刘勰以变为论文的根据的核心」。page=123\n就台湾而言，支持变新说的有王礼卿、陈问梅。王礼卿在《〈文心雕龙．通变．夸饰〉通释》中认为通变的关系是「变出于通，通镕于变」，「通必与变合，独通不足以创新之理，通义始备」，反之亦然。而「凭情以会通，负气以适变」是变通的要则，他认为以自己的感情代入古人的真情就是「通」，而文气有所变化但不离正道就是「负气」。他又批评刘永济「可变不可变」的说法，从各种文章体类不停变化的历史事实立论认为没有可变不可变的说法。而且又引姜宸英《五七言诗选序》批评即使复古也好，但是所演变出来的己经不是当时的「古」。陈问梅反对刘说，认为通指会通，变是变化，本质说通变是一种方法，故此变化需要以会通为本。而通变可以分为二，从文学创作而言，指的是「文类（名）与其文体（理）之相因」；文学改造而言，「矫讹翻浅，还宗经诰」依靠的正是「通变之术」。\n### 「会通适变」说\n「会通适变」说的学者认为继承或者革新的二元对立不合刘勰的原意和通变本意，认为刘勰不是从文学历史角度来谈继承革新的问题，而是从创作的角度以表述问题。这一派的学者强调「通变」的重要是「凭情以会通，负气以适变」王艳艳、高准山。支持者有祖保泉、童庆炳等。\n祖保泉于《文心雕龙解说》中认为刘勰是从创作的角度表述「通变」的问题，而通变的根本原则是「恁情以会通，负气以适变」。故此，作家应该从按自己的情思和创作特色以适当在文辞和体裁上汲取前人的作品资料，而创作出合乎时势的作品。p=561-564童庆炳认为「通变」的关键正是在于「凭情以会通、会气以适变」，针对于自己在诗中体会得到出来的感情作出自己理解，再对于古典作品精神作出传承，而新变之时也应该以自己的气脉和特性以追求新变。p=-208-209\n蔡仲翔在《释「通变」》中认为历来对「变」的研究己经相对完善，但「通」的研究却尚是模棱两可。他认为刘勰在通变虽有谈到继承和革新，但是却在「名理有常」、「通变无方」的两句之中，而非「通变」一词本身。他认为「通变」可以分为两部份，一部份是创作论中的通变，一部份是发展论中的通变。创作论中的通变而言，刘勰在「文之枢纽」的五篇中己经显示了他在文学中的通变，通变应该是「酌乎礼，变乎骚」，真正的文章高手可以按表达的内容以选用合宜的体式。按《易传》「通」、「变」都是互相对举而言，「通」不是指前人的继承，而是指「异质事物的贯通」，例如文学创作中以物色传情，虽然物色有限，但是情感是各异。而发展论中的通变，刘勰是希望在不复古的前提下回归根本，而在「复」和「变」两者中平衡。\n## 与西方文学的交流\n「通变」一词在英文中译法各有差异。Flexible adaptability to varying situations（施友忠）、Continuity and Mutation（宇文所安）、Continuity and Transformation（梅维恒）、Continuity and change（黄兆杰、卢仲衡、林光泰；杨国斌；康达维、张台萍）的翻译都有之，「变」的译法各有所异，其中Transformation强调的是事物改变，而Mutation强调的是事物自变，而Change的词异最广。戴文静认为以Change的词异最为合切，而Flexible adaptability to varying situations没有突显出「通」是「变」的前提和基础。王晓玉认为宇文所安的译法相当合切，「Mutation」能够充份强调出「变」是在参照内在规范的情况下再作出相应的变，即「通」是「变」的前提。\n在西方世界，一般关注刘勰思想的研究者都称之他为「复古主义者」，又或者是「古典主义者」，主要是因为刘勰的「宗经」思想在整本书中贯穿始终。但是，部份学者也认识到刘勰在思想上的求变。在1953年，施友忠在《刘勰《文心雕龙》中的古典主义》（Classicism in Liu Hsieh's \"Wen-Hsin Tiao-lung\"）中指出，刘勰尊祟的是「自然之道」，真情实感是文章的本源，故此在「宗经」的同时也应倾于自己自发的情感，而非一味复古。而且，在通变、《辨骚》、《时序》中也可见刘勰义于文学各种变化的影响，从而可见他是为了借复古而革新。同时，文学创作应该按时间而推移，而结合时代的变迁，故此刘勰的文学观并不是复古主义。纪秋郎沿袭了他的观点，他在《古典主义者和刘勰及其通变观》（Liu Hsieh as a Classiscist and His Concepts of Tradition and Change）强调刘勰的主张并不是复古主义，而是在传统中求变的改良古典主义。例如刘勰虽然祟尚经典，但是在创作时却使用了当时较流行的骈文形式。他认为虽然看似予盾，但是这代表了刘勰作为一个艺术家，他不能为了真理而放弃到美的追求。刘勰虽然推祟儒家经典，但是他不是追求「文以载道」，他的文学变革归根是由审美所推动的，和古文派倡导人韩愈的思想有所不同，他认为不能相提并论。\n「古典主义」一词来自欧洲，故此以此来描写中国文学不免有些不当之处。刘颖认为，两位学者都使用「Classicism」来描写刘勰的宗经思想，是因为宗经和古典主义之间都有些重合，可以概括刘勰思想的一些特点。而且假如完全以中国文学批评话语来解释会产生语言上的隔阂英语。而捷克汉学家王和达教授（Oldřich Král）了解到「古典主义」一词不足以总结刘勰的思想，认为将刘勰称作「古典主义者」的思想相当狭隘。他认为刘勰的目的是为了重建文学的和阶秩序，还文学以本身真实的面目，故此刘勰的复古主义留下了很多可以变化的空间。「通」指的是文学整体基本性质的延续，而「变」是从文学的创新。而「通」在特别情况之下是可以包括在变之中的，「变」是「通变」的核心，而「通」只是贯穿其中的一个概念。\n### 比较\n有学者曾将艾略特的《Tradition and the Individual Talent》与之比较。韩国的金民那认为「望今制奇，参古定法」和《传统与个人才能》中对「传统」和「独创一格」的理论相似，可见「望今制奇，参古制法」是文学对传统和创新的基本要求。而「博觉精阅」的说法则和艾略特所说的「下一番苦功才序心使他的作品具有承先启后的作用」（... if you want it you must obtain it by great labour.）相似。景立鹏认为艾略特所指的传统是「共时性」的，意指个人只是在参与这个秩序，而传统和个人两者是互相适应的。他认为，刘勰的通变观中没有要求从新变直接走向复古，从一个极端走向另一个极端。但相反《传统和个人才能》是希望直接摒弃各种的历史传统包袱，回归艺术本体，而这是因为中国文学有一个具体的创始者和发明者，而西方的传统并没有。而且刘勰当时的思想夹杂着道德思想和文学风尚，而艾略特是希望重新以作品为本位，两者的理解不同。"],

"《文心雕龙·通变》中的通变观受到了周易、魏晋时期以及宋朝文学的影响。\n\n首先，《文心雕龙·通变》中的通变观最早出自于《周易》中的「通」和「变」的理论。《周易》认为宇宙万物都在不断变化，人们应该掌握变化的规律，以求通达。刘勰将这一观点引入文学领域，认为文学创作也需要变化和通达。\n\n其次，在魏晋时期，文学家们开始探索文学的继承和创新，对古人作品进行了细致的研究和发展，这对于刘勰的文学思想产生了影响。葛洪在《抱朴子外篇》中提到文学应该在继承古人精华的基础上进行创新，这与刘勰的通变观点相契合。魏晋南北朝的文化氛围也促使了文学的多元发展，这为刘勰的通变观点提供了现实基础。\n\n此外，宋朝文学也对刘勰的通变观点产生了影响。宋朝文学流派繁盛，不同的作家在创作中追求新颖独特的表达方式，这与刘勰所强调的变化和创新是相符的。刘勰在《文心雕龙》中对唐代、宋代等时期的文学作品进行了分析和评价，这显示了他对宋朝文学的关注和影响。\n\n综上所述，刘勰的通变观受到了周易的影响，同时也受到了魏晋时期和宋朝文学的影响。这些历史时期的思想氛围和文学发展都为刘勰的通变观点提供了理论基础和实践基础。"],

{"name": "《我和我的祖国》", "documents": ["《我和我的祖国》是张藜作词、秦咏诚作曲、黄新国首唱的爱国主义歌曲，于1983年末创作\n，1984年1月发表于刊物《音乐生活》\n，李谷一录制的版本流传较广\n。\n2019年6月17日，该曲入选中宣部评出的“庆祝中华人民共和国成立70周年优秀歌曲100首”\n。\n\n## 创作背景\n\n词曲创作\n《我和我的祖国》是先由秦咏诚创作的旋律，再由张藜填词，两人合作的缘分要从1962年秦咏诚创作的小提琴独奏曲《海滨音诗》说起。当年张藜被这部作品勾起了浓浓的思乡情，经年难忘\n。\n1983年夏天，张藜邀请秦咏诚到北京家中做客，提出请秦咏诚再创作一首与《海滨音诗》有相同情绪和节拍的作品，等旋律完成后再由张藜填词。张藜认为，《海滨音诗》写得太好了，但里面有转调，很多老百姓唱不好，让秦咏诚再写一个有流行度、让老百姓在家都能唱的曲子\n。\n说起《海滨音诗》，秦咏诚想起曾经谱写的一段段乐章。其中有一句上行的旋律：512 345 43定格多次。突然，秦咏诚的灵感闪现，这段下行乐句可谱写成：565 432 15。秦咏诚思维活跃地揣摩一刻钟后，一下子顺利找到了张藜想要的主旋律。找到主旋律后，秦咏诚立即起身坐到钢琴旁，在这段新乐句的基础上，运用复调、对位和分解和弦等作曲手法，不断地展开、变奏、升华\n。秦咏诚只用了20多分钟就完成了《我和我的祖国》的旋律创作，但当时张藜没有立刻想出完美匹配的歌词\n。\n关于歌词的创作地点，有两种不同的说法。一说是在张家界  ，一说是在广西\n。得到曲谱的半年后，张藜到张家界或者广西出差。早晨起床后，他推开窗户，望见旭日缓缓升起，不远处稻田金黄，炊烟袅袅，创作灵感自然而然地流露了出来\n。此次作词，张藜只用了不到20分钟\n。\n在网络流传的很多版本中都提出《我和我的祖国》创作于1984年或者1985年，秦咏诚之子秦际凯纠正说，准确应该是1983年末\n。根据秦际凯提供的手稿，这首歌的创作完成时间最晚是1983年11月10日\n。后来这首歌曲发表在1984年1月的《音乐生活》，是当期杂志的第三首歌曲\n。\n歌手选择\n张藜在张家界完成歌词创作后，迫不及待想找人试唱，于是便找到了张家界当地小有名气的音乐教师黄新国。\n\n秦咏诚一直想找一位唱歌有气势的西洋唱法歌手来演唱。因为在大多数人的印象里，民歌唱法的歌手声音大都软绵绵的，不够有力道。但张藜却认为，如果只是歌唱“我的祖国”，那需要有气势的唱法，但这首歌唱的是“我和我的祖国”，就必须关注“我”的感情。于是，他们选定由李谷一来演唱该曲\n。\n录制轶事\n李谷一在第一次录音该曲时把歌词改了，张藜最初写的是“你用你那母亲的脉搏和我诉说”，李谷一怕老百姓听不清楚、不能直接理解，改成了“你用你那母亲的温情和我诉说”。李谷一告诉张藜后，张藜坚持自己的词，认为自己写的是“诗一般的语言”，为此他们还交锋过。后来，该曲歌词在张藜出版时写的是“脉搏”，而李谷一唱的时候则是“温情”\n。\n\n## 歌曲歌词\n\n我和我的祖国\n一刻也不能分割\n无论我走到哪里\n都流出一首赞歌\n我歌唱每一座高山\n我歌唱每一条河\n袅袅炊烟 小小村落\n路上一道辙\n我最亲爱的祖国\n我永远紧依着你的心窝\n你用你那母亲的脉搏\n和我诉说\n我的祖国和我\n像海和浪花一朵\n浪是那海的赤子\n海是那浪的依托\n每当大海在微笑\n我就是笑的旋涡\n我分担着海的忧愁\n分享海的欢乐\n我最亲爱的祖国\n你是大海永不干涸\n永远给我碧浪清波\n心中的歌\n\n## 歌曲鉴赏\n\n《我和我的祖国》作品采用了抒情和激情相结合的笔调，将优美动人的旋律与朴实真挚的歌词巧妙结合，表达了人们对伟大祖国的衷心依恋和真诚歌颂。\n该曲歌词以第一人称的手法诉说了“我和祖国”息息相连、一刻也不能分离的心情，作者将“我”和“祖国”比喻为孩子和母亲，又将“祖国”和“我”比喻为大海和浪花，这两个具象而生动的比喻，准确又动情，表达了个人和祖国之间，亘古不变的情感。秦咏诚在力求获得准确、生动的音乐形象的同时，十分懂得生活中的语言节奏与音乐中旋律节奏结合的规律，在使听众听得清、听得懂的基础上，保持了应有的线条美和律动美，从而创造了楚楚动人的音乐形象和丝丝入扣的情感表达。\n《我和我的祖国》生动形象地表现了每个人和生他养他的祖国的血肉联系，在词曲结合上“恰到好处”，是一首具有永久魅力、深受人们喜爱的抒情歌曲。\n\n## 歌曲MV\n\n2018年12月26日，中央广播电视总台制作的《我和我的祖国》主题MV发布，MV中不见华丽的艺术舞台，不见专业的歌唱演员，但一个个真实的现实生活场景。镜头前的这些面孔，来自于中国的四面八方、各行各业。他们是人民解放军仪仗队、消防官兵、中国国家女子排球队、港珠澳大桥岛遂工程建设者、路桥水电站建设者、塞罕坝机械林场职工、中国南极考察队、量子科学潘建伟团队、航天科技大军的代表、走在扶贫路上的基层干部\n。\n\n## 社会影响\n\n2019年2月3日至2月10日，中央电视台新闻频道推出“快闪系列活动——新春唱响《我和我的祖国》”系列节目，同时每天在央视《新闻联播》播出。该曲先后在北京首都国际机场、深圳北站、三沙、厦门鼓浪屿、成都宽窄巷、武汉黄鹤楼、广东乳源新时代文明实践中心、长沙橘子洲头唱响，单期节目平均全网总阅读量达五、六亿\n。随后，《我和我的祖国》快闪活动在全国各地唱响\n。\n\n##

为了更贴近人物，黄渤亲自完成攀爬旗杆、电焊、烧铁水等高风险动作戏，其手部也在拍摄过程中受伤\n。\n* 为了真实还原神舟十一号着陆的重大历史时刻，陈凯歌邀请到神舟十一号的航天员景海鹏、陈冬参与该片拍摄。\n* 该片中为两位开启舱门的开舱手，现实中曾为多个返回舱开启舱门，其他参演的航天工作人员也都参与了2016年神舟十一号降落的搜索工作。\n* 该片剧组做了真实的道具，不仅特种车辆、返回舱降落伞是实物，连片中两位航天员的宇航服也是他们在神舟十一号上穿过的\n。\n* 任素汐无法想象她饰演的角色方敏所经历的生活，她只能靠翻阅资料去靠近这个角色\n。\n* 拍摄《北京你好》单元时，因为导演宁浩总是要保留一段，为了跟随剧组的节奏，演员王东总是反复拍、反复跑。\n\n## 获奖记录\n\n## 幕后制作\n\n### 创作背景\n\n2018年12月24日，黄建新和陈凯歌导演一起接到了创作该片的任务。最初，创作团队确定了从“普通人”视角出发的创作理念。随后，陈凯歌又确立了统一七个故事影像风格的标准：要大气深情，有情感的剧烈碰撞\n。黄建新和陈凯歌开了三次会，在第二次会上，他们决定要拍和以往劳动模范、民警等不同的小人物。这个想法得到了电影局的支持。在确定了航空母舰、汶川地震等30多个事件后，黄建新和陈凯歌导演将拍摄的事件筛选到了十几个，然后让参与拍摄的导演们挑选\n。在该片的创作上，导演陈凯歌、总制片人黄建新、总出品人傅若清一起确定了12个字——历史瞬间、全民记忆和迎头相撞，正是这12个字起到提纲挈领的作用，确定了该片最本质的东西\n。\n\n### 拍摄过程\n\n为了保持每个导演的独立气质，黄建新坚持分别成立7个摄制组，而非用2组轮替\n。2019年3月24日，该片正式开机拍摄\n。\n《前夜》\n管虎创作《前夜》单元之前，有意识地将镜头聚焦在伟人身后，想看看那些平时不被注意的普通人做了什么。创作团队在史料的整合过程中发现了林治远的事迹，并把他耗费几个月时间为确保国旗万无一失的工作拍摄出来\n。\n《夺冠》\n导演徐峥拍摄《夺冠》的过程中，将儿时对上海的记忆情景再现，而美术指导郜昂和他的美术团队并没有经历过20世纪80年代初的上海生活，但为了还原历史风貌，他们查阅了大量资料，了解当时的生活细节，还从老弄堂里回收锅碗瓢盆、布衣、窗帘等时代旧物，尽量不在视觉信息层面出现问题，从衣食住行和弄堂形态层面，还原一个原汁原味的老上海弄堂风情\n\n。\n《回归》\n为了还原《回归》单元中“香港回归”的场景，导演薛晓路邀请了时任交接仪式升旗手的朱涛作为升旗部分的总指挥和顾问，指导杜江、朱一龙等演员。在他的指导下，演员们除了训练走正步、升旗这些基本动作，小到下巴、仰头的角度也被逐一纠正\n。\n《白昼流星》\n拍摄《白昼流星》单元时，陈凯歌调用戈壁滩工作车、道具车加上军车共百余辆，浩浩荡荡在戈壁上建起剧组。该单元的工作人员组成“影视科研小组”，观看大量素材，熟悉返回舱不同的状态，同时多次前往国家航天博物馆进行测算。最终，创作者和当时事件的亲历者一道，在苍茫的敦煌戈壁上1:1还原出当时的情景\n。\n《护航》\n为了拍摄《护航》单元，导演文牧野也前往空军部队经受不少“训练”。该单元中80%的镜头实拍，为了展现最真实的战斗机视野，《护航》调动了真正的歼-10战斗机。由于剧组所有工作人员们都没有坐超音速飞机上天的资格，为此，工作组还特意对歼-10战斗机的飞行员进行了拍摄培训，使其真实还原空中飞行全貌。飞行员摄影师上天前，文牧野给他画图和各种参数，回来再看素材调整\n。\n\n##

影片评价\n\n《我和我的祖国》带领观众们重温了新中国70年的峥嵘岁月，让观众们深刻体会到“我”与中国的血脉相连，激发了观众们内心最朴素的爱国情怀。《我和我的祖国》既是一部献礼的影片，更是一封写给祖国的情书，用“我”的故事、“我”的经历、“我”的感动向祖国表白\n。\n面对高昂宏大的礼赞主题，《我和我的祖国》以小见大，塑造了身处大时代的“小人物”群像。该片既有取材史实的真实人物，如开国大典自动升旗装置设计师、香港回归仪式升旗手、原子弹研究人员、舍己扶贫基层干部、备飞护航女飞行员；也有大胆创设的艺术形象，如上海里弄小男孩、北京出租车司机、迷途知返的失足青年等。这些在大事件中鲜为人知的小人物，默默无闻而又矢志不渝地将“小我”的人生篇章，无私地融入共和国的“大我”华章中。他们所承载的奉献、牺牲、拼搏、捍卫、坚守的时代精神，穿越时空，历久弥新，凝聚成为“我和我的祖国，一刻也不能分隔”的坚强信念，也生动地表达着“历史是人民写就的”价值主题。该片一方面是类型化叙事手法的纯熟应用，既有传统电影叙事手法经典再现，也不乏商业类型片悬念叙事的娴熟应用，多种叙事手法交互作用，让故事的讲述饶有趣味，有效调动了观影的愉悦度，另一方面是风格化叙事艺术的成功把握，让该片的基调始终较好地控制在质朴深情、温暖奋进的向度上，不仅营造了富有历史阶段的生活质感与时代氛围，如里弄、胡同、市井的生活景观，家用电器上留存的生活方式，而且呈现了广阔的社会场景与生活容量。大量使用关键性细节对于叙事的引导作用也起到了不容低估的效用，比如“前夜”中旗杆上的阻断球、“回归”中的钟表、“夺冠”中的电视天线、“北京你好”中的奥运会门票。细节叙事的精巧设计，令故事饱满有力\n。\n不少观众担心该片可能会有说教味、太刻板，但实际上，《我和我的祖国》却很接地气、很平实。《我和我的祖国》虽然以重大历史事件为背景，但它的切入点非常巧妙——它关注的是“我”，千千万万普通人中的你我他，以大历史中“我”的故事，来讲述那段岁月，实现个体与宏大时代的共鸣。《前夜》单元采取的是“最后一分钟营救”的叙事手法，一个小短片拍得一波三折，惊心动魄，感人至深。而在张一白执导的《相遇》单元里，观众们更能深切感受到“我分担着海的忧愁”的那种敢于奉献与牺牲的精神。虽然张一白并没有把这个故事拍得太“抒情”，但它依旧感人至深\n。\n要和观众产生共鸣，文艺作品就应该被落点设置为生活。《我和我的祖国》中的7个故事，无疑都在努力向这个方向靠拢。即使是相对争议最大的《白昼流星》单元，也把“扶贫”“自强”等大主题承载于两个顽劣少年和一位普通干部身上。不管呈现出的效果如何，7部在剧情上并无联系的短片在这一点上达成了一致。可惜的是，部分短片还是被过大、过重的意义吞没了，以至于作品中的人物只剩下符号意义，而没能显示出更鲜活的生命力。比如《相遇》中的张译和任素汐，两人的演技都很过硬，身处的场景也很动人，但最终还是没能展现出两个角色的个性所在。这样的遗憾也出现在《回归》和《护航》里。前者的问题是线索过多，叙事过乱，在短短二十分钟的篇幅里导演什么都想讲，结果什么都成了点到为止。而在《护航》里，女飞行员的能挺过高强度测试，靠的不是严格训练，也不是刻苦学习，多少让观众感到不可信。如果能赋予这个人物更多个性化色彩，整个故事显然会更出彩。《前夜》和《夺冠》都把激动人心的历史时刻化解为普通人的喜怒哀乐，令人眼前一亮。《前夜》这部短片的角度选取，可谓巧妙。略微不足的是，群像戏本来能给《前夜》增添光彩，但除了林治远外，其他人的面目还是模糊了些。当然，这或许还是受制于篇幅的关系。《夺冠》里的小主人公，就更可爱了。徐峥对上海市井文化的拿捏，恰到好处，既突出了那个时代的爱国热情，又展现了邻里之间的那点温情。可以说，浓郁的生活气息，是这部短片获得成功的基石。《北京你好》这个故事本身，并不比《前夜》或者《夺冠》更优秀。但葛优的加盟，让这部短片瞬间脱颖而出。张北京这个人物，亮眼的地方不在于他接地气的“嘚瑟”，也不在于他被汶川少年感动时的善良，而就在他敢于自嘲、自黑的那份勇气里。看得出，葛优的很多表演浑然天成，代入了不少自身对角色的理解和感悟\n。新手上路\n\n成长任务\n编辑入门\n编辑规则\n本人编辑我有疑问\n\n在线客服\n官方贴吧\n\n投诉建议\n\n举报不良信息\n未通过词条申诉\n投诉侵权信息\n封禁查询与解封\n\n©2023

拜占庭哲学思想、理论的统称。内容主要为：（1）关于基督教三位一体问题。（2）8～13世纪拜占庭地区下层农民、手工业者和城市平民以宗教教义的解释为旗帜开展政治的、思想的运动。他们继承古希腊哲学传统，有的倾向于柏拉图哲学，有的倾向于亚里士多德哲学，大多则信奉新柏拉图主义。主张哲学和神学相结合，利用哲学论证基督教教义。大概有四个特点：9～15世纪之间，有所谓“外来”与“内在”的哲学。外来的哲学指富有希腊色彩的希腊文化思想，内在的哲学指的是基督宗教的神学，希腊教父常称为基督宗教神学，是“真正的哲学”；外来的哲学具有完全独立的理论。神学是在修道院中传授。当时的高等教育，市委训练高级官员设立，因此哲学教育并不普遍。欧洲学校中，哲学院与神学院的冲突，不存在与拜占庭的学术与文化背景；哲学倾向于修行，而不偏重理论性的形上学。哲学家是一位学贯东西的学者，能教授多种不同的知识。哲学作品包括修辞学、祭文描述叙事文等。其学术活动中心先在雅典，529年后移至君士坦丁堡，后转至亚历山大城，并在此成立哲学学院，主要研究基督教神学。", "## 拜占庭哲学\n拜占庭哲学指的是拜占庭帝国的哲学家和学者的独特哲学思想，尤其是在8世纪到15世纪之间，基督教的世界观为其特点，不过它可能会直接从柏拉图、亚里士多德和新柏拉图主义者的希腊文本中汲取思想。\n## 历史\n当时古希腊的科学及文学在拜占庭世界依旧很活跃，虽然当时拜占庭哲学的主要中心思想是基督教，但仍大量借鉴了柏拉图、亚里士多德和新柏拉图主义者的思想。公元7世纪，大马士革的约翰编写了一部百科全书《智慧之泉》，分为三个篇章，他在第三篇中系统性地阐述了基督教神学。公元9世纪，君士坦丁堡普世牧首佛提乌搜集了许多古代作家的作品，并研究了亚里士多德的逻辑学，他的学生Arethas of Caesarea（Arethas of Caesarea）对柏拉图和亚里士多德的著作发表了评论。到了11世纪和12世纪，人们对哲学教学的兴趣与日俱增，像米海尔·普塞洛斯、Eustratius of Nicaea（Eustratius of Nicaea）和Michael of Ephesus（Michael of Ephesus）这些人都撰写了关于亚里士多德的评论。公元13和14世纪出现如Nikephoros Blemmydes（Nikephoros Blemmydes）和Theodore Metochites（Theodore Metochites）等重要哲学家。其中一位重要人物是格雷格利乌斯·帕拉玛斯，他发展了被称为静默主义（Hesychasm）的神秘主义运动，这个运动使用了noetics（noetic）的耶稣祷文来实现Tabor Light）（uncreated Light）的幻象，自存光也被称为Christian contemplation。正是静默主义运动在东方基督教中造成分歧，导致许多有哲学思想的人西迁。这种迁移对西方文艺复兴的出现发挥了关键作用。尤其是反对静默主义的Barlaam of Seminara（Barlaam of Seminara），在西方罗马天主教神学的形成中发挥了作用。拜占庭最后一位伟大的哲学家是格弥斯托士·卜列东，他认为恢复柏拉图主义可以扭转帝国的衰落。他是将古代哲学传到西方的一个重要人物。\n## 君士坦丁堡大学\n与世界其他地区相比，拜占庭社会依那个时代的标准而言，算受过良好的教育，识字程度更高。值得注目的是，拜占庭社会拥有世俗的教育体系，这是古典时代学院的延续。初等教育即便是在农村也十分普及。男女都能在那个社会中接受教育是绝无仅有的事情。正是在这种背景下才得以理解世俗化的君士坦丁堡大学。帝国内进一步接受世俗教育的情形在某种程度上也很常见。在穆斯林征服以前的几个世纪，类似的教育机构一直在安条克和亚历山大港等重要行省首府运作。\n最早的学校由皇帝狄奥多西二世于425年创立，设有31个教席，涵盖法律、哲学、医学算术、几何、天文学、音乐、修辞学和其他学科，其中15个学科以拉丁语教授，16个学科以希腊语教授。这所大学一直存在到15世纪。\n大多数学生所接受的高等教育的主要内容是修辞学、哲学和法学。目的是为国家和教会的官僚职位培养合格、学有专长的人才。在这个意义上，这所大学是神学院的世俗化版本。这所大学保留了以柏拉图主义和亚里士多德主义为基础的活跃哲学传统。柏拉图主义是持续时间最长且从未中断过的柏拉图学派哲学，延续将近两千年，直到15世纪为止。\n9世纪成立了玛格瑙拉宫学院，11世纪时成立了新的哲学和法律的学院。君士坦丁堡大学在1204年遭到拉丁人征服后陷入衰落，不过在君士坦丁堡陷落之前，大学还是作为教会管理下的非世俗机构幸存了下来。\n## 问题和思想\n拜占庭哲学的主要特征是：\n世界和人类都受到divine providence（Providence）的支配，但拜占庭哲学家主张自由意志和自决的必要性。灵魂作为不朽的存在，并非透过自身能量创造出来，而是在其自身中创造。灵魂是身体与精神的结合，它与智慧直接相连，使人能够透过决定的自由获得幸福。上帝与人类的关系建立在爱的基础上，这就解释了人类在创造中的中心地位。\n### 新柏拉图主义\n对于上帝的神秘的宗教性理解与哲学理解之间的关系，在罗马东部的历史上有著不同的发展阶段。在拜占庭哲学中，只有当作为心灵的知性（nous）与人的内心或灵魂相调和时，它才被赋予理解上的核心作用。灵魂是人的整体，作为理性的和纯粹知性的心灵是人的灵魂不可或缺的一部分。早期版本的基督教与希腊哲学之调和（syncretism）在现代被称为新柏拉图主义。这方面有个例子可见于俄利根的作品及其对知性的学说，他认为所有灵魂都作为「思想」或「知性」以完美的精神（非物质性）状态同其造物主预先存在，但后来为了追求成为独立于上帝的存在而离开。由于所有的灵魂都设立为绝对自由，上帝不能简单地强迫灵魂返回他身边（根据俄利根的说法，这是由于上帝对其创造物的无止境的爱和尊重）。与此相反的是，上帝创造了物质宇宙，开创了历史，目的是引导不受控制的灵魂回到他无限的心灵的沉思，根据俄利根的说法，这是完美的状态。"],

{"name": "等宽曲线", "documents": ["# 等宽曲线\n\n数学名词\n\n圆是与一个定点的距离等于定长的所有点组成的曲线。车轮就直接地应用了圆的这个性质。车轮正是由于它的等长的车辐，使车轴处于一定的高度，从而得到一个平稳的水平运动。倘若车轮不是圆的，那么车轴将会产生一种忽上忽下的运动。运动中如果有很大的载重，轮和轴就不能保持十分坚固。## 定义及性质\n\n有时我们要移动重物，可以如同图1左那样把重物放在圆木棍上滚动，并平稳地前进。圆用来作滚动的原因是由于圆有这样的性质，即当圆不管怎样滚动时，圆的任何一对平行切线的距离总是相等的。即圆在任意方向都有相同的宽度，因而圆也就是所谓的“等宽曲线”。\n然而令人惊讶的是，对于完成滚动所需要的性质来说，棍的横断面未必要是圆的!\n\n## 等宽曲线画法\n\n### 常规画法\n\n事实上存在着大量的非圆等宽曲线，最简单的等宽曲线不是圆，而是如图1右所示的曲边三角形。它的画法如下：\n1．画一个等边三角形；\n2．以所作的等边三角形的三个顶点为圆心，边长为半径，作各内角所对的圆弧。\n显然，这个等宽曲线的宽度等于原来等边三角形的边长。请你亲自动手做个实验。把一硬纸卡片剪出一个如上所画的等宽曲线的样子，而用另一硬纸卡片剪下一个正方形的洞。如果正方形的边长等于曲线的宽度，那么不管方向怎样变化，它正好合适地装入这个曲线板，并且这个等宽曲线板可以在正方形内紧密无间地自由转动（如图2左）。实际上，任何等宽曲线都可以在边长等于曲线宽度的正方形内紧密无间而自由地转动；反之，可以在正方形内紧密而自由地转动的曲线也是等宽曲线。\n用这种等宽曲线做横断面的滚子，也能使载重物水平地移动，而不至于上下颠簸（如图2右）。这种具有奇特功能的曲边三角形，是由工艺学家鲁列斯首先发现的，所以也称为鲁列斯曲边三角形。\n在鲁列斯的等宽曲线上有尖点，即在两条圆弧相交处形成角顶。我们希望它光滑一些，可以按下面的方法得到没有任何角顶的新的等宽曲线：把等边三角形的各边向两个方向延长相等的一段；以三个顶点为圆心画圆弧，使得三个内角所对的圆弧的半径，等于边长与延长线的长度的和；内角的对顶角所对的圆弧的半径，等于延长线的长。由这样的六条圆弧组成的等宽曲线克服了尖点，因此光滑得多了。\n\n### 画法关键\n\n画等宽曲线的关键的想法是：圆弧的中心是它所对的角顶。下面介绍一种等宽的曲边多边形的一般画法，并使它的宽度为b。开始可以把任意点B作为第一个角顶，以B为圆心、b为半径画弧；在这个弧上，选择A和C二点作为新角顶，以C为圆心、b为半径画弧（该弧必经过B）；在这个弧上，选择另一个角顶D，以D为圆心、b为半径画弧（该弧必经过C），如果我们希望结束这个过程，可以在这个弧上选择角顶E，使它也处在以A为圆心、b为半径的弧上（该弧必经过点B）。也就是E是两个弧的交点。最后，用一个以E为圆心、b为半径的弧连接A和D，这样就得到一个等宽的曲边五边形ADBEC。边数更多的多边形，可用同样的方法作出来，这只要多作几步，然后使曲线成为闭合的就可以了。\n同样的原理，我们还可以利用这些曲线得到没有任何角顶的等宽曲线。\n这些方法使我们可以构作无数个等宽曲线，它们都是由许多圆弧组成的。但不要误解为等宽曲线只能由圆弧组成，实际上有这样的等宽曲线，它的一部分不管是多么小，都不是圆弧。在这里我们不可能介绍它，因为已经超出了初中几何知识的范围。\n\n## 应用\n\n日常生活中，我们看到许多加盖的盛具，如锅、杯、壶、缸、桶之类，都是圆口圆盖的形状。这除了容易加工制造以外，主要还是应用圆是等宽曲线的特性。圆形的盖子，只要它不变形，从任何方向都不会掉进盛具里去。为了提高观赏价值与品茶雅兴，一些艺术茶壶的壶盖可以设计成其他等宽曲线的形状。"], "selected_questions": ["什么是等宽曲线？", "除了圆以外，是否存在其他形状的等宽曲线？", "除了盛具，等宽曲线还有哪些应用？"], "GPT3.5_answers_D": ["等宽曲线是指满足在任意方向上宽度相等的曲线。", "是的，除了圆以外，还存在其他形状的等宽曲线。例如，鲁列斯曲边三角形就是一个常见的非圆等宽曲线。此外，还可以使用曲边多边形构建等宽曲线。", "除了盛具，等宽曲线还有以下应用：\n1. 滚子设计：等宽曲线可以用于设计滚子，使得载重物在滚动过程中保持水平稳定。\n2. 轮胎设计：等宽曲线可以用于车轮的设计，保证车轮在行驶时保持平稳。\n3. 曲边多边形设计：可以利用等宽曲线设计曲边多边形，用于固定结构或装饰设计。\n4. 茶壶设计：艺术茶壶的壶盖可以采用等宽曲线的形状，提高观赏价值与品茶体验。"], "InternLM_answers": ["等宽曲线是指在等温图上连接相同厚度等温线的曲线。它表示同一高度上的大气层结构，因此可以用来描述大气层的垂直结构。等宽曲线的形状和分布可以反映大气层的温度、湿度、气压等物理特性的变化情况。", "除了圆以外，还存在其他形状的等宽曲线，其中最为著名的是卡普兰曲线（Cardioid）。卡普兰曲线是一条类似于心形的曲线，它的形状类似于一个心形，也可以看作是一个圆上的点的轨迹。除了卡普兰曲线，还有其他形状的等宽曲线，例如三叶线、四叶线等。这些曲线的形状各不相同，但它们都有一个共同的特点，即它们的宽度在任何方向上都相等。", "等宽曲线在工程、建筑、设计等领域也有应用。在工程领域，等宽曲线可以用于设计和优化机械结构，如齿轮、凸轮等。在建筑领域，等宽曲线可以用于设计和优化建筑结构，如拱形结构、屋顶等。在设计领域，等宽曲线可以用于设计和优化产品形状，如汽车、家具等。"], "human_GPT3.5_answers_D_ann": [["<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考0：即当圆不管怎样滚动时，圆的任何一对平行切线的距离总是相等的。即圆在任意方向都有相同的宽度，因而圆也就是所谓的“等宽曲线”"], ["<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考0：事实上存在着大量的非圆等宽曲线，最简单的等宽曲线不是圆，而是如图1右所示的曲边三角形", "<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考0：事实上存在着大量的非圆等宽曲线，最简单的等宽曲线不是圆，而是如图1右所示的曲边三角形。这种具有奇特功能的曲边三角形，是由工艺学家鲁列斯首先发现的，所以也称为鲁列斯曲边三角形", "<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考0：这些方法使我们可以构作无数个等宽曲线，它们都是由许多圆弧组成的。但不要误解为等宽曲线只能由圆弧组成，实际上有这样的等宽曲线，它的一部分不管是多么小，都不是圆弧"], ["<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考0：有时我们要移动重物，可以如同图1左那样把重物放在圆木棍上滚动，并平稳地前进。圆用来作滚动的原因是由于圆有这样的性质，即当圆不管怎样滚动时，圆的任何一对平行切线的距离总是相等的。即圆在任意方向都有相同的宽度，因而圆也就是所谓的“等宽曲线” 参考0： 用这种等宽曲线做横断面的滚子，也能使载重物水平地移动，而不至于上下颠簸（如图2右）。", "<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考0：车轮就直接地应用了圆的这个性质。车轮正是由于它的等长的车辐，使车轴处于一定的高度，从而得到一个平稳的水平运动。倘若车轮不是圆的，那么车轴将会产生一种忽上忽下的运动", "<幻觉>无法验证\n<参考>参考0：在鲁列斯的等宽曲线上有尖点，即在两条圆弧相交处形成角顶。我们希望它光滑一些，可以按下面的方法得到没有任何角顶的新的等宽曲线：把等边三角形的各边向两个方向延长相等的一段；以三个顶点为圆心画圆弧，使得三个内角所对的圆弧的半径，等于边长与延长线的长度的和；内角的对顶角所对的圆弧的半径，等于延长线的长。由这样的六条圆弧组成的等宽曲线克服了尖点，因此光滑得多了\n<改正>“3. 曲边多边形设计：可以利用等宽曲线设计曲边多边形，用于固定结构或装饰设计。”改为“”。", "<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考0：为了提高观赏价值与品茶雅兴，一些艺术茶壶的壶盖可以设计成其他等宽曲线的形状"]], "human_InternLM_answers_ann": [["<幻觉>矛盾\n<参考>参考0：圆在任意方向都有相同的宽度，因而圆也就是所谓的“等宽曲线”\n<改正>“等宽曲线是指在等温图上连接相同厚度等温线的曲线”改为“等宽曲线是指在任意方向都有相同的宽度的曲线”。", "<幻觉>矛盾\n<参考>参考0：即当圆不管怎样滚动时，圆的任何一对平行切线的距离总是相等的。即圆在任意方向都有相同的宽度，因而圆也就是所谓的“等宽曲线”\n<改正>“它表示同一高度上的大气层结构，因此可以用来描述大气层的垂直结构”改为“”。", "<幻觉>矛盾\n<参考>参考0：圆在任意方向都有相同的宽度，因而圆也就是所谓的“等宽曲线”\n<改正>“等宽曲线的形状和分布可以反映大气层的温度、湿度、气压等物理特性的变化情况”改为“”。"], ["<幻觉>无法验证\n<参考>参考0：事实上存在着大量的非圆等宽曲线，最简单的等宽曲线不是圆，而是如图1右所示的曲边三角形\n<改正>“，其中最为著名的是卡普兰曲线（Cardioid）”改为“，如鲁列斯曲边三角形”。", "<幻觉>无法验证\n<参考>参考0：事实上存在着大量的非圆等宽曲线，最简单的等宽曲线不是圆，而是如图1右所示的曲边三角形 参考0：在鲁列斯的等宽曲线上有尖点，即在两条圆弧相交处形成角顶。我们希望它光滑一些，可以按下面的方法得到没有任何角顶的新的等宽曲线：把等边三角形的各边向两个方向延长相等的一段；以三个顶点为圆心画圆弧，使得三个内角所对的圆弧的半径，等于边长与延长线的长度的和；内角的对顶角所对的圆弧的半径，等于延长线的长。\n<改正>\"卡普兰曲线是一条类似于心形的曲线，它的形状类似于一个心形，也可以看作是一个圆上的点的轨迹。\"改为\"鲁列斯的等宽曲线上有尖点，即在两条圆弧相交处形成角顶。我们希望它光滑一些，可以按下面的方法得到没有任何角顶的新的等宽曲线：把等边三角形的各边向两个方向延长相等的一段；以三个顶点为圆心画圆弧，使得三个内角所对的圆弧的半径，等于边长与延长线的长度的和；内角的对顶角所对的圆弧的半径，等于延长线的长。\"", "<幻觉>无法验证\n<参考>无\n<改正>\"卡普兰曲线，三叶线、四叶线\"改为\"\"。", "<幻觉>无\n<参考>参考0：然而令人惊讶的是，对于完成滚动所需要的性质来说，棍的横断面未必要是圆的!

{"name": "《琵琶记》", "documents": ["《琵琶记》是元末戏曲作家高明根据长期流传的民间戏文《赵贞女蔡二郎》改编创作的南戏，是中国古代戏曲中的一部经典作品。此剧叙写东汉书生蔡伯喈与赵五娘悲欢离合的爱情故事。全剧共四十二出，结构完整巧妙，语言典雅生动，显示了文人的细腻目光和酣畅手法，是高度发达的中国抒情文学与戏剧艺术结合的作品。\n\n## 内容梗概\n\n《琵琶记》讲述的是东汉时期故事。书生蔡伯喈离别父母、妻子进京赴试，经年不归，造成家庭悲剧，最终光宗耀祖的故事。陈留都人蔡伯喈娶妻赵五娘，新婚两月，夫妻和顺相敬，蔡的父母身体康健，一家人和和美美；在春光明媚的日子里，全家花下酌酒，为亲祝寿。\n不久，朝廷黄榜招贤，郡县把蔡伯喈申报上司。伯喈以双亲年迈不能远离为由，坚决拒绝。蔡母也恐失去倚恃，不愿伯喈上京赴考。然而蔡父认为此是光宗耀祖的大好时机，硬逼着伯喈赴试。邻居张广才也一力赞成，且答应照顾蔡家。伯喈万般无奈，只得打点上京。\n伯喈一举及第，登上状元，官拜议郎。他思念父母，正要上表辞官，不料牛丞相此时却奉旨招伯喈为婿，伯喈以有妻室、双亲年迈为由予以拒绝，一并辞婚。牛相非常恼怒，奏明朝廷，圣旨不准伯喈辞官辞婚。伯喈只得与牛小姐成婚。\n伯喈走后，赵五娘于家中尽心竭力地待奉公婆。当时陈留逢上饥荒之年，生活艰难，蔡家陷入困苦之中。蔡母埋怨蔡父不该逼伯喈上京考试，二人终日争吵。五娘从中百般劝解，并典卖钗簪首饰，换粮米养活公婆，自己却背地里吃糠挨饿，好不容易得到一些救济粮，又被恶霸里正抢去。\n五娘躲在厨房吃糠的行为引起蔡父蔡母的猜疑，他们以为她在背地里偷吃好东西。一日蔡父蔡母突然闯入厨室，抢过五娘的饭食察看，才知道媳妇吃的是糠。悲痛之下，蔡母一哀身亡，蔡父也后悔不该让伯喈上京。不久，蔡父罹病，临终之前，对儿媳妇赵五娘的辛勤待奉深感愧疚，他要五娘改嫁，并留下拄杖一根给广才，嘱其等伯喈归来，打他出家门。蔡父死时，因无力安葬，五娘剪下自己的头发典卖，埋葬了公公，以麻裙包土自筑坟台，然后画出公婆遗像，身背琵琶，一路弹唱行孝曲子，进京寻夫。\n蔡伯喈在牛府弹琴抒愁，因为心意烦乱而时时出错。他思念父母妻子，托人往家乡捎信，不料捎信的人却是骗子，信没有捎出去。中秋之夜，与牛氏在花园中赏月，月色皎洁，牛氏心情畅快，伯喈见月伤心，思念家人。牛氏窥探到伯喈的心事，于是劝牛丞相同意自己和伯喈回陈留探亲。牛丞相考虑再三，决定到陈留接取伯喈父母妻子来京。\n赵五娘只身到京城，适逢弥陀寺做佛会，便去追荐公婆。在寺门前她展挂公婆遗像卖唱。此时伯喈也前来佛寺祈祷父母来京一路平安。伯喈随从因五娘卖唱碍事，赶走五娘，伯喈将父母遗像带回府。五娘寻遗像到牛府，与牛小姐相遇，二人相惜，各诉衷肠，说出原委，才知道“三不从做成灾祸天来大”。\n在牛小姐的安排下，五娘与伯喈相见，彼此细说别后的情况，伯喈痛感“文章误我，我误爹娘；文章误我，我误妻房”。牛丞相也回心转意，同意伯喈偕牛氏、五娘回陈留守墓。张广才也知道伯喈事出无奈，原谅了他。全剧结尾是：牛丞相奉诏书到陈留，旌表蔡氏一门。\n\n## 剧本目录\n\n## 创作背景\n\n### 社会背景\n\n《琵琶记》所叙述的有关书生发迹变泰后负心弃妻的现象，与宋代科举制度有着密切的关系。科举制度规定，不论门第出身，只要考试中式，即可为官。这为寒士发迹提供了一条捷径。“朝为田舍郎，暮登天子堂”，便是这种情况的写照。书生初入仕途，需要寻找靠山，权门豪贵也需要拉拢新进以扩充势力。联姻便成了他们利益结合的手段。而当书生攀上高枝，抛弃糟糠之妻时，便与原来的家庭以及市民阶层报恩的观念，不可避免地发生了冲突，导致一幕幕家庭和道德的悲剧。市民大众厌恶书生这种薄幸的行为，不惜口诛笔伐，这就是宋代民间伎艺产生大量谴责婚变作品的原因。宋代婚变故事一般都把矛头指向书生，是因为当时他们不仅有着优渥的社会地位，而且作为知书达礼的道德传承者，肩负着社会的责任。地位和行为的反差，自然使他们成为人民大众特别是市民阶层谴责的主要目标。\n到了元代，社会情况发生了巨大的变化，书生的处境，从天上跌到地下。元代科举一度中断达七十余年，终元之世，考试制度时兴时辍。这使许多士人失去进身之阶，社会地位急遽下降，以至出现“九儒十丐”的说法。与此相联系，谴责书生负心婚变的悲剧作品，逐渐失去了现实的针对性。地位低下的书生，反成了同情的对象。所以元代戏曲里的书生形象，或是平庸怯懦，或是迂阔拘谨，尽管多半缺乏光彩，但很少作为被鞭挞的对象。到元代后期，人们对地位得不到改善的书生愈加怜惜，正面歌颂书生志诚的作品渐渐成为戏曲的主流。高明的《琵琶记》，以同情宽恕的态度，刻划蔡伯喈的形象，正体现了当时的社会情态。\n\n### 创作时间\n\n高明于元顺帝至正五年（1345年）考中进士，从此步入仕途，历官处州录事、绍兴路判官、庆元路推官等。后辞官隐居于宁波城南二十里的栎社，寓居于沈氏楼中，闭门谢客，埋头于诗词戏曲的创作。《琵琶记》即创作于至正二十二年（1362年）到二十五年（1365年）之间。\n《琵琶记》就戏剧文体来说是属于宋元南戏的范畴，南戏是南曲戏文的简称，是与北曲杂剧相对而言的专名。它最初起源于南方的温州地区，原名“温州杂剧”或“永嘉杂剧”。据明人祝枝山《猥谈》记载道：“南戏出于宣和之后，南渡之际，谓之温州杂剧。予见旧牒，其时有赵闳夫榜禁，颇述名目，如《赵贞女蔡二郎》等。”徐文长的《南词叙录》则说：“南戏始于宋光宗朝，永嘉人所作《赵贞女》《王魁》二种实首之。”可见南戏发源于北宋徽宗宣和（1119—1125年）之后，经历南宋前期的酝酸，至光宗时（1190—1194年）盛行起来，这符合于从萌芽到成熟的发展规律。\n\n### 故事来源\n\n《琵琶记》系改编自民间南戏《赵贞女》（即《赵贞女蔡二郎》），更早时还有金院本《蔡伯喈》。据记载，宋代戏文《赵贞女蔡二郎》情节大致写蔡二郎应举，考中了状元，他贪恋功名利禄，抛弃双亲和妻子，入赘相府。其妻赵贞女在饥荒之年，独立支撑门户，赡养公婆，竭尽孝道。公婆死后，她以罗裙包土，修筑坟茔，然后身背琵琶，上京寻夫。可是蔡二郎不仅不肯相认，竟还放马踩踹，致使神天震怒。最后，蔡二郎被暴雷轰死。\n宋代戏文所写的蔡二郎，亦称蔡中郎，也就是汉代著名文士蔡邕，字伯喈。戏中所写的情况，只是出于民间传说。陆游在《小舟游近村舍舟步归》诗中云：“斜阳古柳赵家庄，负鼓盲翁正作场；死后是非谁管得，满村听说蔡中郎！”可见早在南宋前期，以蔡二郎为题材的民间文艺已广泛传唱于城乡各地。类似这种题材，在宋代说话、鼓词、诸宫调、杂剧等民间伎艺中，还有《王魁负桂英》《陈叔文三负心》《王宗道负心》等。这表明书生负心婚变现象在当时相当普遍，书生贪新弃旧、攀龙附凤的行为尤其受到市民阶层的关注。\n《琵琶记》基本上继承了《赵贞女》故事的框架，但改变了原故事中蔡伯喈背亲弃妇的形象。它保留了赵贞女的“有贞有烈”，但对蔡伯喈的形象作了全面的改造，让他成为“全忠全孝”的书生。为了终养年迈的父母，他本来并不热衷于功名，只是辞试不从，辞官不从，辞婚不从，这“三不从”导致一连串的不幸，落得个“可惜二亲饥寒死，博换得孩儿名利归”的结局。\n\n## 人物形象\n\n赵五娘\n赵五娘，是全剧中最为光辉的人物，是一个光彩照人的贤孝妇形象。“仪容俊雅”“德性幽闲”的赵五娘是个美丽端庄且具有一定文化修养（知经书，能书，善画）的姑娘，嫁与同郡（陈留郡）蔡伯喈为妻。故事发生的时候，她结婚才两个月。丈夫进京赶考，她独自一人在家侍奉公婆，承担起家庭的全部重担。饥荒年间，她把可怜的救济粮留给公婆，自己却在背后偷偷吃糠。公婆死了，无钱买棺材，她剪下头发，沿街叫卖。无钱请人埋葬公婆，她麻裙包土，自筑坟墓。然后描容上路，进京寻夫。在极度艰难的环境中，她含辛茹苦，任劳任怨，悄悄地作出自我牺牲，以柔弱的肩膀，承担起生活重担，既尽了心，又尽了力。在赵五娘身上体现出中华民族多方面的优秀品德。\n赵五娘这一形象一方面在很大程度上保持着民间创作的特点，另一方面她又体现着高明的道德理想。这就决定了这一形象的两重性，赵五娘这一形象集中体现了封建社会中下层妇女的优点：吃苦耐劳、孝敬温顺、克己待人、勇于自我牺牲。同时也集中体现出下层妇女的弱点：过分的温顺屈从，而缺乏自主意识。过分的忍受而缺乏反抗意识，逆来顺受，从一而终。剧中的赵五娘在重重困苦中苦苦挣扎，确实表现出一种惊人的坚韧性格和自我牺牲精神，但她对自己的悲惨命运怨而不怒，悲而不愤，从未有过抗争之举，显出一种十足的奴性。赵五娘的形象具有典型意义。\n蔡伯喈\n蔡伯喈，被塑造成贤孝子的形象，又是一个有情的丈夫。他在京城，处于富贵生活之中，并没有忘掉父母的养育之恩。他还时时想到父母的衣食冷暖，担心父母在家挨饥受饿，还设法给父母寄钱寄信，处于锦衣玉食之中，他还有一颗对父母的爱心，还保存有骨肉之情。比之于那些投靠权贵，认贼作父，忘恩负义的衣冠禽兽来说，他确是一个有品德，有孝心的儿子。他被迫招赘牛府，生活在温柔之乡，但他时时想着家中的妻子赵五娘。他并没有因赘入牛府就忘却自己的糟糠之妻，还是那样一往深情的爱她。\n蔡伯喈是一个忠于爱情，有良心，有善心的丈夫。他的形象，也是颇为感人的。不过这只是表面现象，面对他的岳父大人，他连据理力争一下都不敢，则显得有点懦弱。\n张广才\n张广才，也是一个成功的艺术形象，他是中华民族优秀品德“义”的化身。饥荒年间，他将得到的救济粮分一半给赵五娘，帮助她一家度日。蔡公蔡婆死后，他又赠送棺材，帮助这个弱女子葬送公婆。他救人于危难之中，有恩于人还不图报答。他那颗同情苦难之心，救人危难之心，助人为乐之心，是中华民族的善良之心，仁爱之心，无私之心在闪闪发光。因此，张广才的形象就成了千百年来人们歌颂的形象。\n\n## 作品鉴赏\n\n### 思想内容\n\n《琵琶记》是高明根据长期流传的民间戏文《赵贞女蔡二郎》改编的。据《南词叙录》透露，《赵贞女蔡二郎》原本的情节是揭发蔡伯喈一旦飞黄腾达后就背亲弃妇，停妻再娶。后来赵贞女上京寻夫，伯喈竟丧尽天良，马踩赵氏，结果他自己遭到惩罚，被暴雷震死。正如京剧的《小上坟》“啰啰腔”唱词所说：“贤慧的五娘遭马蹦，到后来五雷轰顶是那蔡伯喈。”整个剧情与《王魁》和《张协状元》相似，都是鞭挞封建士子负心忘本的卑劣行径的。但高明把《赵贞女》改编为《琵琶记》时，把蔡伯喈写成了正面人物，颂扬他是全忠全孝的典型，并且把悲剧的结局改成了大团圆。\n《琵琶记》剧中说蔡伯喈原是孝子，同赵五娘结婚后感情很好。戏剧矛盾的原因是：他本来不肯上京应试，而父亲不从；他考中状元后，牛府招之为婿，他辞婚，而牛丞相不从；他想辞官归里，而皇上又不从。这就是所谓“三不从”或“三被强”，证明“背亲弃妇”是被迫造成的，责任不在蔡伯喈，这便是为蔡伯喈卫护的主要关目。剧中另一条线索是写蔡伯喈入京后家乡陈留郡遇到了严重的灾荒，赵五娘极其艰难地维持一家的生计，蔡婆和蔡公在饥饿中死去后，赵五娘一路弹唱琵琶词行乞，到京师寻找丈夫。由于牛小姐的贤惠大度，终于使赵五娘和蔡伯喈团圆，并得到了朝廷的旌表。高明的创作意旨很明显是借此宣扬封建道德，他在剧本开场的《水调歌头》词中宣称：“不关风化体，纵好也徒然。”“休论插科打诨，也不寻宫数调，只看子孝共妻贤。”不过，在指出其封建性的糟粕的同时，还应看到剧中存在着民主性的精华，主要是作者成功地塑造了劳动妇女赵五娘的悲剧形象。剧中通过赵五娘的悲惨遭遇，谴责了科举制度的蠹害人心，揭露了封建礼教的罪恶，反映了农村遭灾后的惨象，抨击了官吏鱼肉乡民的暴行，突出了元代末年的社会矛盾。\n《琵琶记》总体上看，作者主观希望“为文人立心”，宣传忠孝君臣的封建道德。但其思想内容比较复杂：表明封建社会忠孝难以两全，在“全忠全孝”的同时又有一定批判；在宣传封建道德时，对于当时的黑暗现实也有所批判，暴露了封建社会的黑暗，如牛丞相的专横、地方官的腐败。\n\n### 艺术成就\n\n《琵琶记》在艺术技巧上有可以借鉴的地方。这个戏长达四十二出，但情节的处理却很紧凑密合。作者把京城牛府与乡下蔡家这两条线索的戏剧冲突交错写下来，使丞相府第骄奢豪华的生活与农村百姓的苦难遭遇形成了强烈的对比，既映示了贫富不均的社会现实，又产生了冷热对照的艺术效果。作者对语言的运用也很得体，能照应到各种不同阶层人物的身份，如牛府诸人的语言尚雅，乡村蔡家诸人的吐语俚俗，富于个性，表现在曲词上，也能用浅近的口语描摹出人物复杂的思想感情。\n《琵琶记》的结构布置最为人称道。《琵琶记》是双线结构。一条线是蔡伯喈上京考试入赘牛府；一条线是赵五娘在家，奉养公婆。在宋元南戏和明清传奇中，有许多剧本都是双线结构，但在这些双线结构中，所组成的两个故事，有许多是互不相关的，它们不能彼此促进，互为增辉。而《琵琶记》的双线结构不同，它们共同敷演一家的故事，共同表演一个主题。两条线索交错发展，对比排列，产生了强烈的悲剧效果和巨大的艺术感染力。作者把蔡伯喈在牛府的生活和赵五娘在家乡的苦难景象交错演出，形成强烈对比。《成婚》与《食糠》，《弹琴》与《尝药》，《筑坟》与《赏月》，以及《写真》，都是写的很成功的篇章。对比的写法突出了戏剧冲突，加强了悲剧的气氛。\n《琵琶记》刻画了典型环境描中的典型人物。作者描写了“旷野原空人离业败”、“饥人满道”、灾害频仍、贪官污吏鱼肉乡里的典型环境，正是在这样的社会环境里描写了赵五娘悲惨的生活遭遇，突出了她在灾荒岁月中儿独自养亲的艰难处境，从而以她的形象体现了封建制度下不能掌握自身命运的中国妇女在极端艰苦的生活环境里的美好品质。正因为如此，赵五娘的形象才长期活跃于舞台，赢得了几百年来广大读者观众的深切同情，在文学史上占有一席地位。\n《琵琶记》的语言，文采和本色两种兼备，既有清丽文语，又有本色口语，而最重要的则是体贴人情的戏剧语言。蔡伯喈在京城生活这条线的人物，用的是文采语言，词句华美，文采灿然，语言富于色彩，讲究字句的雕琢，典故的运用，是一种高度诗化的语言，是一种高雅的语言。这是由于他们的文化水平，和富贵生活的环境而决定的。蔡伯喈、牛小姐、牛丞相等，都是很有知识的人，说起话来，自然就雅，这是符合人物身份的。他们生活在相府之中，住的是亭台楼阁的华屋，过的是锦衣玉食的生活，用华丽的语言来写豪华的生活，才能和谐一致。赵五娘这条线的人物，用的是本色语言。自然朴实，通俗易懂，生活气息很浓。不讲究词藻的华丽，典故的运用，词句的雕琢。这是一种接近于人民生活的语言。赵五娘这条线上的人物，使用本色语言，也是由于他们的文化水平和贫穷生活而决定的。赵五娘、蔡公、蔡婆、张广才等，都是没有多少文化的人，自然不会咬文嚼字，子云诗曰。他们生活在农村，住的是民房，过的是农村生活，用朴素的语言来描绘这种生活，才能和谐一致。剧中两种不同的人物，使用两种不同的语言，构成两种不同的语言风格，这是《琵琶记》运用语言的独特之处。\n《琵琶记》全剧典雅、完整、生动、浓郁，显示了文人的细腻目光和酣畅手法。它是高度发达的中国抒情文学与戏剧艺术的结合。不论在思想内容上，人物形象上，还是在结构和语言方面，《琵琶记》都有独特之处，值得欣赏玩味。因此，《琵琶记》是一部值得弘扬的优秀剧作。\n\n## 后世影响\n\n《琵琶记》所叙写的，确是“子孝与妻贤”的内容。高明强调封建伦理的重要性，希望通过戏曲“动人”的力量，让观众受到教化。在这方面，《琵琶记》产生过一些消极的作用。但高明主张戏曲必须有关风化、合乎教化的功用，把当时士大夫所不屑的南戏看作可以“载道”的工具，却意在抬高南戏的地位和价值。同时，高明能正视社会生活的真实，在肯定孝子贤妻的同时，揭示封建伦理本身存在的矛盾，展示由于封建伦理而产生的社会悲剧，而给予观众强烈的震撼。\n《琵琶记》尽管从正面肯定了封建伦理，但通篇展示的却是“全忠全孝”的蔡伯喈和“有贞有烈”的赵五娘的悲剧命运，从而可以引发对封建伦理合理性的怀疑。在封建时代，恪守道德纲常的知识分子，经常陷入情感与理智，个人意愿与门第、伦理的冲突之中。《琵琶记》的悲剧意蕴，具有深刻性和普遍性，它比单纯谴责负心汉的主题，更具社会价值。\n《琵琶记》是一部劝忠劝孝之作，也是一部思想内容极为丰富的主题多义之作。在几千年的古代社会中，中华民族长期形成并逐步发展起来的忠孝节义等社会道德观念，包含有好的和坏的两种成份，古代的孝道亦然。在古代的孝道中，有维护父母的绝对利益，要儿子作出无谓的牺牲，作奴隶式的服从，诸如“父要子亡，子若不亡，则为不孝”，或“割股救母”之类的愚孝，这是坏的。有热爱父母，善事父母，为了报答父母的养育之恩，使父母安度晚年而奉献自己的力量，这是贤孝，这是好的。《琵琶记》意在宣扬贤孝，宣扬孝道中好的一面，宣扬中华民族的优秀道德，这对进行社会主义精神文明建设，有很大的现实意义。\n《琵琶记》的文学成就，大大超过了《永乐大典戏文三种》中的作品。高则诚是在民间创作的基础上，把戏文的剧本创作提高到一个新水平的杰出作家。他在南戏发展史上的地位颇似杂剧发展史上的关汉卿。《琵琶记》在艺术上所取得的成就，不只影响到当时剧坛，而且为明清传奇树立了楷模。所以，过去把它称为“南戏之祖”。\n《南词叙录》记载：“我高皇帝即位，闻其名，使使征之，则诚佯狂不出，高皇不复强。亡何，卒。时有以《琵琶记》进呈者，高皇笑曰：‘五经、四书、布、帛、菽、粟也，家家皆有；高明《琵琶记》，如山珍、海错，贵富家不可无。’”可见《琵琶记》的影响和作者声名之盛。\n《琵琶记》自问世以来，流播六百余年，一直颇受世人的关注。明清时期，不仅市井百姓户诵家传，被目为“《女通鉴》” ，而且名公士子的戏曲论著中亦常以为话题。在传承过程中，《琵琶记》为同时或后期的许多剧种所改编，传播形式多样。如昆曲《琵琶记》、越剧《琵琶记》、豫剧《琵琶记》、川剧《琵琶记》、京剧《赵五娘》、淮剧《赵五娘》等，均由高明《琵琶记》改编而成。它还被译为法文、日文，传播国外。中国戏剧家协会曾在北京召开关于评价、整理《琵琶记》的讨论会。\n\n## 作品评价\n\n明代魏良辅《曲律》：《琵琶记》，乃高则诚所作，虽出于《拜月亭》之后，然自为曲祖，词意高古，音韵精绝，诸词之纲领。\n明代何良俊《四友斋丛说》：“金元人呼北戏为杂剧，南戏为戏文。近代人杂剧以王实甫之《西厢记》，戏文以高则诚之《琵琶记》为绝唱。”\n明代王世贞《艺苑卮言》：“则诚所以冠绝诸剧者，不唯其琢句之工，使事之美而已。其体贴人情，委曲必尽，描写物态，仿佛如生，问答之际，不见扭造，所以佳耳。”\n明代吕天成《曲品》：“串插甚合局段，苦乐相错，具见体裁，可师可法，而不可及也。”\n清初朱彝尊《静志居诗话》：“闻则诚填词，夜案烧双烛，填至《吃糠》一出，句云‘糠和米本一处飞’，双烛花交为一，洵异事也。”\n清代黄图珌《看山阁集闲笔》：“《琵琶》为南曲之宗，《西厢》乃北调之祖，调高辞美，各极其妙。”\n\n##

主要职责\n\n资产追回\n国际反贪局联合会认为，腐败犯罪越来越呈现出有组织、跨国化的趋势。腐败分子犯罪后潜逃出境，或将赃款转移境外，已成为各国有效惩治腐败犯罪的一大障碍。为此，公约在建立、完善境外追逃、追赃机制方面提出了针对性措施。\n《公约》创设了腐败犯罪所得资产的追回法律机制：直接追回机制和间接追回机制。相对而言，利用直接追回机制追回资产的成本较高。作为被贪污国追回转移至境外的腐败犯罪所得资产，利用间接追回机制应是主要途径。但是由于在间接追回机制中，追回被贪污、挪用的公共资产，需要法院作出的生效判决，如因罪犯死亡、潜逃或者缺席无法起诉罪犯以至于无法获得生效判决时，或者在其他适当情形下，被请求缔约国应当考虑放弃对生效判决的要求。并且《公约》还要求各缔约国应当根据本国法律，考虑采取必要措施，以便在因为犯罪人死亡、潜逃、或者缺席而无法对其起诉的情形或者其他相关情形下，能够不经过刑事定罪而没收腐败犯罪所得资产，以便进行资产返还。\n国际合作\n《公约》在规定司法协助、引渡的条件时，都规定有不得仅以腐败犯罪也被视为涉及财税事项为由而拒绝司法协助请求或者引渡；在《公约》为引渡依据时，不应当将《公约》所确立的任何犯罪视为政治犯罪。由于腐败犯罪系由公职人员利用职权而实施的一类犯罪，常常又涉及公共财产，因此，在腐败犯罪的性质上往往产生一些争议，诸如有的因意识形态的差异甚至是出于敌意而将惩治腐败犯罪认为是政治派别倾轧、打击持不同政见者的结果和手段，因而将腐败犯罪视为政治犯罪拒绝引渡，或者认为腐败犯罪涉及国家国库财产事项而为国家政治行为，并以此为由拒绝司法协助请求或者引渡。\n立法体系\n《公约》主张全方位综合立法，比如对有关预防腐败问题，就涉及制定预防性反腐败政策、设立预防性反腐败机构、加强公共部门管理、制定公职人员守则、建立公共采购和公共财政管理、增加公共行政部门透明度、加强防止司法机关腐败、防止涉及私营部门腐败、推动社会参与、加强金融管理等方面的立法等。\n腐败已成为“世界性犯罪”。《公约》全方位规定了国际合作问题，要求缔约国应当在刑事案件中相互合作，在与腐败有关的民事和行政案件调查和诉讼中相互通过引渡、被判刑人的移管、司法协助、执法合作、联合侦查、在国际间采取特殊侦查手段、加强技术援助和信息交流等方式开展国际合作，其突出贡献在于详尽规定资产的追回和返还。\n保障人权\n在现代诉讼模式的设计上，总是在控制犯罪和保障人权之间寻找平衡点，可以认为，人权保障是刑事诉讼的总体流向，但在反腐败领域，正如《公约》第三十条所言，应“保持一种适当的平衡”，对公职人员的权利进行适当限制：既照顾到公职人员履行其职能所给予的豁免或者司法特权，又照顾到在必要时对其腐败犯罪的侦查、起诉和审判的可能性；为确保犯罪人出庭，应慎重对待保释；在无罪推定的基础上，可对腐败犯罪人先行撤职、停职或调职。显然，这些规定是为在公职人员的权利与反腐败司法职能之间建立平衡。在建构以人权保障为中心的刑事诉讼体系时，必须考虑到反腐败司法制度的特点，在反腐败领域，应当平衡地设计人权保障制度。近年来专门制定特别的反贪污贿赂法的国家，都对官员的人身自由、财产权利等作特别限制，如收缴旅行证件；无证搜查与逮捕；严格的财产申报；设立禁止令、责任令、没收令制度等。在司法制度的设计上，既要考虑对公民权利的保护，不能用超越法律的手段来对待公职人员，也要考虑反腐败的需要，使用一些严格于普通公民的措施来约束公职人员，以有效打击和惩治腐败。\n\n## 组织理念\n\n国际反贪局联合会要求会员国按照《联合国反腐败公约》要求缔约国根据本国法律制度的基本原则，制定、执行和坚持有效的预防性反腐败政策，以促进社会参与，体现法治、妥善管理公共事务和公共财产，促进廉正、透明度和问责制(acountability)。《公约》要求缔约国应确保建立一个或者酌情建立多个机构，并赋予其必要的独立性和专门的人力、财力资源，以对预防性反腐败法律、政策的实施进行监督和协调，并积累和传播预防腐败的知识。\n在预防腐败的过程中，《公约》规定要鼓励公共部门以外的个人和团体积极参与进来，确保公众有获得信息的有效渠道，并进行预防腐败的公共教育和宣传，除非有法律的规定并为必要的限制外，要尊重、促进和保护有关腐败的信息的寻找、接收、公布和传播的自由。针对这项要求，我们应积极研究社会参与的有效途径，尤其是发挥新闻媒体的舆论监督在预防腐败方面的积极作用。\n腐败活动往往与金融活动联系在一起，腐败犯罪分子会千方百计利用金融活动进行腐败资产的转移或洗钱。《公约》已充分注意到了这一点。为此，金融机构也应加强研究和建立验证客户身份、保持交易记录和报告可疑交易的制度和措施，加强金融情报机构的建设，以收集、分析和传递关于腐败活动或者潜在洗钱活动的信息，遏制和监测可疑资金的跨境转移。\n公约规定，各缔约国可根据本国法律的基本原则，采取措施消除腐败行为的后果，包括在法律程序中将腐败视为废止或者撤销合同、取消特许权或者撤销其他类似文书。这个规定意味着，从腐败行为中获得的利益都将可能被剥夺。依据《公约》的规定：各缔约国应当根据本国法律采取必要的措施，确保因腐败行为受到损害的实体或个人有权获得赔偿。\n国际反贪局联合会对《联合国反腐败公约》的高批准率和高签约率表示满意和赞赏，并呼吁尚未签署或批准的国家能够简化加入公约所必需的国内程序，将加入公约作为最优先和紧急的事项。\n国际反贪局联合会呼吁签约国忠实地履行公约条款，按照公约相关条款的规定建立反腐败机构或修改现有机构的授权范围和权力界限；呼吁签约国依靠公约，加强在刑事事务方面，尤其在引渡以及相互的法律协助案件方面的国际合作。\n国际反贪局联合会决议敦促反腐败机构充分利用公约的相关条款，建立和加强业务上的合作，互相学习，相互支持。国际反贪局联合会决议提请公约签约国会议优先关注对各种各样的关于资产追回的动议的统筹，注重确保这些动议之间的协调一致，以达到效率和效果的最大化。\n国际反贪局联合会决议还呼吁联合国开发计划署以及国际金融机构，尤其是多边发展银行，积极参加公约签约国会议，与联合国毒品与犯罪署共同合作，在相关工作中充分地落实公约的规定，尤其在建立技术协助的公共计划方面与联合国毒品与犯罪署加强合作，以促进对公约的充分实施。\n\n## 组织机构\n\n随着腐败变得越来越复杂，传统的法律强制执行机构侦查和揭发腐败的能力变得越来越弱。此外，在一个腐败成为普遍现象的体系里，传统的法律强制机构自身就有可能产生腐败的官员。从反腐败能力和有效性考虑，一个反腐败机构必须具有以下特点：在政府的最高层中赢得政治支持；在政治上和操作上有独立性，这样甚至可以调查政府高层的腐败；要有足够的权力来查阅文件和询问证人，并且领导层高度清廉。\n与此相应，《公约》强调设置专职机关，重申《打击跨国有组织犯罪公约》关于设置预防腐败机构、设置国际联合侦查机构的规定。《公约》第三十六条规定，应当确保设有一个或多个机构或者安排调查报告人员专职负责打击腐败。第六条重申《打击跨国有组织犯罪公约》第三十一条的规定，要求应当确保设有一个或酌情设有多个预防性反腐败机构，并将这些机关的名称和地址通知联合国秘书长；第四十九条重申《打击跨国有组织犯罪公约》第十九条的规定，要求应当考虑缔结双边或多边协定或安排，就涉及一国或多国侦查、起诉或者审判程序的事宜建立联合侦查机构；在多边机构建设问题上，明确提出采取措施防止司法机关腐败，第十一条规定在不影响审判机关和检察机关独立性的情况下，应当采取措施防止这类机构出现腐败，加强其人员的廉洁性。\n《公约》关于加强专门预防机构、专门审判机构建设，加强对司法机关监督的要求值得重视。中国反腐败机构主要有执政党的纪律检查机关、行政监察机关和检察机关。虽然纪律检查机关和行政监察机关合署办公，但由于其领导体制和立法赋予的职能不同，形成执政党、政府和司法机关三个不同系统各负其责，由执政党纪律检查机关进行组织协调的格局。就司法机关而言，检察机关被宪法定位为法律监督机关，担负有对普通刑事案件的起诉、侦查监督、犯罪预防等职能，并非专门的反腐败机构。在这些机构中，只有内设机构反贪污贿赂局是专门的反腐败机构，在现行法律中，未明确该局的法律地位。中国现阶段的反腐败机构建设应在已经有专业化的反腐败侦查机构——反贪污贿赂局的基础上，以立法的方式确认其法律地位。并可考虑在人民法院审判序列中，分立设置专门的反腐败法庭。同时，加强监督机制的体制性和程序化建设，改变对司法机关监督缺位和监督弱化的局面。\n《公约》提出允许采用特殊侦查手段，结合国际社会加强反腐败机构职能的趋势，中国刑事司法制度也应进行改革：一是提倡公开秘密结合或强化秘密侦查权。这一方面是由于腐败犯罪人往往具有一定权势和反侦查能力，公开侦查阻力较大，另一方面是由于公职人员的职务原因，公开侦查将影响其执行职务所需要的公信力。二是提倡反腐败侦查职能应具有“多科性”。由于腐败犯罪具有复杂性，应综合运用会计、金融、税收等经济学科的方法展开侦查，而审计方法在经济学科中具有综合性质，因此，应将审计职能配属反腐败机构；三是建立强制作证和特殊强制措施体系，腐败犯罪知情人往往以保守公务秘密为由，拒绝作证，以职务形成的权力对抗干扰侦查，赋予反腐败机构可以强制作证和通过程序剥夺或暂时停止腐败嫌疑人职权的职能是必要的。\n\n##

["辛亥革命胜利后，以孙中山为首，于南京建立中华民国临时政府。此后，宋教仁起草制定的此法，是具有资产阶级宪法性质的文件。1912年3月11日取代《中华民国临时政府组织大纲》并开始施行。后于1914年5月1日因《中华民国约法》（袁世凯的法律）的公布而被取代，1916年6月29日又被大总统黎元洪恢复施行。\n1917年9月10日，以广东为基地建立的中华民国军政府展开护法运动，正是为保护《中华民国临时约法》。\n\n## 简介\n\n此文件是中国第一部资产阶级宪法性质文件。（注：《钦定宪法大纲》是中国历史上第一部宪法性文件，《中华民国临时约法》是中国第一部资产阶级宪法性文件，二者不矛盾）\n是辛亥革命胜利后，以孙中山为首，建都于南京的中华民国临时政府制定的具有“宪法”性质的根本大法。1912年由宋教仁起草，于3月8日由南京临时参议院通过，3月11日公布实施，取代《中华民国临时政府组织大纲》。\n1914年5月1日因袁世凯《中华民国约法》（俗称“袁记约法”）的公布而被取代。在1916年6月29日为大总统黎元洪所恢复。1917年7月1日被复辟帝制的张勋破坏，随后的段祺瑞政府拒绝恢复，9月10日以广东为基地建立的中华民国军政府展开护法运动，所护者即为《中华民国临时约法》。\n在北洋政府部分，1922年4月被控制北京政府的曹锟、吴佩孚以“法统重光”的号召，再度恢复。1923年10月10日，被人称“曹锟宪法”的1923年《中华民国宪法》的施行而取代。1925年4月24日段祺瑞政府发布命令，称“法统已成陈迹”，《临时约法》再次被废除。\n\n在南方政府部分，则从未正式废止，直到1931年6月1日《中华民国训政时期约法》公布才依新法优于旧法原则而失其最高效力，但国民政府于1925年7月1日建立后则少谈及这一法律。\n南北军阀在袁世凯死后，首先争执的是所谓新旧《约法》，段祺瑞根据袁世凯生前炮制的所谓新《约法》（《中华民国约法》），以国务院名义发布了一个由副总统黎元洪“代行”总统职权的通电。段祺瑞的恶劣行径，遭到了护国军和全国人民的坚决抵制。唐继尧等南方军阀把持的军务院，梁启超等进步党人，孙中山、黄兴等原国民党人，以及北洋军阀内部如冯国璋等，都主张应该恢复《临时约法》和国会；根据《临时约法》，黎元洪应该“继任”总统，而不是“代行”总统职权。由于全国一致反对，段祺瑞被迫暂时让步。1916年6月，副总统黎元洪继任大总统。6月29日，北京政府以大总统名义下令恢复《临时约法》，同时宣布定于8月1日召开国会。历时近一个月的新旧《约法》之争，最终以《临时约法》和国会的恢复而结束。7月，军务院撤消。在南方的进步党和原国民党议员前往北京参加国会复会会议，南北暂时合作。\n\n## 政治制度\n\n仿法国式的责任内阁制：当时的参议院为抑制袁世凯的野心，乃将原《中华民国临时政府组织大纲》的总统制改为内阁制使袁世凯成为虚位总统。\n总纲以简洁的文字，将国家的要素作原则性的规定。\n人民权利义务的保障已有详尽的规定，并设有法律保留条款。\n大总统副总统的选举：仍沿《中华民国临时政府组织大纲》的精神由参议院选举。\n司法已有独立审判规定，符合三权分立原则：《约法》规定法院以临时大总统及司法总长分别任命的法官组织。法官独立审判不受上级官厅之干涉。\n\n##

袁氏制宪\n\n1913年民国两项最重要的政治任务，是制定正式宪法和选举正式大总统，以取代《临时约法》和临时大总统。袁氏对《临时约法》限制总统权力的种种规定极度不满，在新宪法制定过程中，采取了各式各样的手段，试图夺取宪法起草权——为防止总统权力被宪法限制，袁氏竭力要求先选总统，后定宪法；国会则竭力抵制，要求先定宪法，确定总统权限，再选总统。袁氏最后竟联络十八省都督联名指责声讨国会，压迫国会服从自己的旨意，先选举总统。而一旦当选为总统，袁氏即对国会弃若敝屣：“当选总统后，一再背信弃义，既不到国会就职，又不出席国会发表政见。在保和殿就任时，把议员们排在朝房内，让议员们看不到他，也听不到他的誓词，显然藐视国会。”\n当选总统前，袁氏为免引起国会反感，一度压抑住了自己干涉宪法起草的欲望；当选之后，这种干涉立即汹涌喷薄而出。1913年10月10日就任大总统，16日袁氏就公开对《临时约法》中限制总统权力的规定展开猛烈的批判——不但在措辞上可谓肆无忌惮，而且上纲上线，将民国成立以来，国家治理所出现的一切问题，都归结为《临时约法》对总统和政府权力的“束缚驰骤”。袁氏公然大放厥词：“本大总统之愚，以为《临时约法》第四章关于大总统职权各规定，适用于临时大总统已觉有种种困难，若再适用于正式大总统，则其困难将益甚……本大总统一人一身之受束缚于约法，直不啻胥吾四万万同胞之身命财产之重，同受束缚于约法！——按袁世凯的意思，临时约法因为限制了大总统的权力，简直就等于是在拿四万万国人的身家性命财产开玩笑，简直是罪大恶极，是一份亡国约法！\n袁氏一心想将所有一切军政外交大权独揽在自己这个大总统手上，如此，袁氏才觉得安心，才有信心带领民国走向富强。袁氏似乎忘了，共和是怎么来的——辛亥年的革命，恰恰缘自国人对皇权专制的不信任和否决；革命是为了民主分权，绝不是为了专制集权——袁氏似乎没有意识到：一个不愿意权力受到宪法制约的大总统，和一个专制皇帝，又有什么区别呢？\n\n## 时代背景\n\n1911年武昌起义后．南京临时政府于1912年1月1日宣告成立。南京临时政府在其存在的三个多月里．颁布了一系列有利于推行民主政治、发展资本主义和实行社会改革的法令，如《保护人民财产令》、《大总统令内务部禁止买卖人口文》、《文官试验章程草案》等等，其中最重要的成果则是1912年2月7日由参议院制定的，于3月11日颁布的《中华民国临时约法》。\n从阶级结构分析：当时，在半殖民地半封建社会的中国，地主阶级和农民阶级是两大基本阶级，在资本主义生产方式的刺激下，资产阶级和工人阶级都有所发展，同时还有一个凌驾于中国社会各阶层之上的特殊阶层——帝国主义在华势力。资产阶级是革命的领导阶级，并且，中国的资产阶级也并非铁板一块，根据其经济基础和政治需求的不同，分为官僚资产阶级、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级。主要社会矛盾决定了辛亥革命的性质是为争取民族独立、建立资产阶级共和国、开辟资本主义发展道路的资产阶级革命，在当时都具有历史进步性。\n\n## 几经更迭\n\n自袁世凯就任总统后，中央权力的运行严重违背约法精神，至1914年被袁氏《中华民国约法》取代，《临时约法》的存续期仅两年。此后，孙中山先生虽发动了维护约法的护法运动，也告失败。其中原因是什么?对此，学界向来比较集中的看法为三点：一是从当时的政府力量对比分析，认为孙中山为代表的资产阶级革命派没有掌握可以保证《临时约法》得以实施的武装力量。二是从袁世凯个人的政治品质分析，认为南北议和后孙中山被迫放弃政权是导致《临时约法》失败的主要原因。但这同样不能解释袁世凯死后孙中山领导的护法运动何以失败；三是从中国社会政治土壤分析，认为《临时约法》必然与资产阶级革命一样，在中国行不通。这种观点很深刻，但过于笼统，没有从更深层次上解答更本原的问题：何以中国社会竟没有适合于《临时约法》存续的土壤。\n\n## 社会观点\n\n《临时约法》并非各政治派别、各阶层、各阶级基于民主、共和的共同政治理念的产物。首先，同盟会内部在政权组织形式上存在分歧，体现为以孙中山为代表的总统制和以宋教仁为代表的内阁制两种主张。《临时政府组织大纲》采用的是总统制，而事实上，在制订约法的过程中，鉴于当时南北和谈已成定局，袁世凯必将就任总统的现实，《临时约法》最后关于政体的设计临时改弦易辙，既规定了总统的各项实际权力，又极尽可能地赋予参议院和国务员各种广泛的权力和实际的责任，以限制总统的权力，使得行政权力的划分极其混乱，成为一种介于总统制和内阁制之间的特殊的体制，表现出典型的因人设法的工具主义倾向，而不是一种成熟、稳定的政治理念的实践。其次，在《临时约法》的制订机关南京临时参议院的43名参议员中，同盟会会员33人，立宪派仅8人，没有代表最强势政治集团的北洋军阀势力的袁世凯的代表。这种结构虽然保证了约法内容上的先进性，但很难保证各政治派别对约法的一致认同和遵守。最为重要的是，“社会正在发生变革，但主要仍限于统治阶层内部”，《临时约法》所体现的精神内涵并没有形成为占人口绝大多数的广大农民的价值观念，广大农村对民主、共和的观念还非常陌生。\n\n## 历史意义\n\n《临时约法》尽管未能提出反帝的革命任务，也没有提出一个完整的从经济基础到上层建筑的反封建纲领。但在那个时期是一个比较好的东西．其精髓在于它通过立法程序．确立了资产阶级共和国的国家政治制度和政权的组织形式．以及人民的民主权利。其实践意义在于在中国第一次开创了以法治国的先河。其思想启蒙的意义在于促进了人民的觉醒，鼓舞人民起来为维护自己的权利而斗争。其推动中国社会发展的意义在于使民主共和观念深入人心．为以后民主革命进一步发展提供了条件。其宪法意义在于实现了宪政原则。正如陈旭麓先生所言：“南京临时政府的成立以及《中华民国临时约法》的颁布．是‘揖美追欧’的结果．也是‘五·四’以前八十年先进的中国人经过几代人的奋斗而取得的最富深远意义的结果。\n\n## 基本要义\n\n以孙中山为首的南京临时政府公布的、具有资产阶级共和国宪法性质的文献。1912年3月8日南京临时参议院通过，11日公布施行。计分总纲、人民、参议院、临时大总统副总统、国务员、法院、附则等七章，共五十六条。\n①临时约法体现了资产阶级民主共和国的国家制度。规定“中华民国由中华人民组织之”，“主权属于国民全体”，“领土为二十二行省、内外蒙古、西藏、青海”；“以参议院、临时大总统、国务员、法院行使其统治权”。\n②临时约法体现了民主主义精神。规定“中华民国人民一律平等，无种族、阶级、宗教之区别”。人民享有人身、居住、财产、言论、出版、集会、结社、通信和信教的自由；人民有请愿、诉讼、考试、选举及被选举等权利。同时规定，人民有纳税、服役等义务。\n③在政府的组织形式上实行“三权分立”的原则。规定全国的立法权属于临时参议院，参议院有权议决一切法律、预算、决算、税法、币制及度量衡准则，募集公债，选举产生临时大总统、副总统，弹劾大总统和国务员，对临时大总统行使的重要权力，具有同意权和最后决定权。\n临时大总统代表临时政府总揽政务，公布法律，统率全国海陆军，制定官制官规，任免文武官员等，但行使职权时，须有国务员副署。受参议院弹劾时，由最高法院组成特别法庭审判；法官有独立审判的权利，它否定了集大权于一身的封建君主专制制度。此外，还规定了“人民有保有财产及营业之自由”。体现了发展资本主义经济的要求。\n临时约法是辛亥革命胜利的重要成果，是一个具有历史性的进步。1914年5月废除，由《中华民国约法》取代。"],

创作背景\n\n这首诗作于唐肃宗至德二年（757）春。至德元年（756）秋天，安禄山攻陷长安，杜甫离开鄜州去投奔刚即位的唐肃宗，不巧，被安史叛军抓获，带到沦陷了的长安。旧地重来，触景伤怀，诗人的内心是十分痛苦的。第二年春天，杜甫脱逃，沿长安城南昔日皇家贵族、官绅士女的游览胜地曲江行走，想起当年唐玄宗与杨贵妃游曲江东南的芙蓉苑旌旗招展、万象生辉的情景，感慨万千，心乱目迷，哀恸欲绝。《哀江头》就是当时心情的真实记录。\n\n## 作品鉴赏\n\n### 整体赏析\n\n《哀江头》全诗分为三部分。前四句是第一部分，写长安沦陷后的曲江景象。曲江原是长安有名的游览胜地，开元年间经过疏凿修建，亭台楼阁参差，奇花异卉争芳，一到春天，彩幄翠帱，匝于堤岸，鲜车健马，比肩击毂，有说不尽的烟柳繁华、富贵风流。但这已经成为历史了，以往的繁华像梦一样过去了。“少陵野老吞声哭，春日潜行曲江曲。”一个泣咽声堵的老人，偷偷行走在曲江的角落里，这就是曲江此时的“游人”。第一句有几层意思：行人少，一层；行人哭，二层；哭又不敢大放悲声，只能吞声而哭，三层。第二句既交代时间、地点，又写出诗人情态：在春日游览胜地不敢公然行走，却要“潜行”，而且是在冷僻无人的角落里潜行，这是十分不幸的。重复用一个“曲”字，给人一种纡曲难伸、愁肠百结的感觉。两句诗，写出了曲江的萧条和气氛的恐怖，写出了诗人忧思惶恐、压抑沉痛的心理，诗句含蕴无穷。“江头宫殿锁千门，细柳新蒲为谁绿？”写诗人曲江所见。“千门”，极言宫殿之多，说明昔日的繁华。而着一“锁”字，便把昔日的繁华与眼前的萧条冷落并摆在一起，巧妙地构成了今昔对比，看似信手拈来，却极见匠心。“细柳新蒲”，景物是很美的。岸上是依依袅袅的柳丝，水中是抽芽返青的新蒲。“为谁绿”三字陡然一转，以乐景反衬哀恸，一是说江山换了主人，二是说没有游人，无限伤心，无限凄凉，这些场景令诗人肝肠寸断。\n“忆昔霓旌下南苑”至“一笑正坠双飞翼”是第二部分，回忆安史之乱以前春到曲江的繁华景象。这里用“忆昔”二字一转，引出了一节极繁华热闹的文字。“忆昔霓旌下南苑，苑中万物生颜色”，先总写一笔。南苑即曲江之南的芙蓉苑。唐玄宗开元二十年（732），自大明宫筑复道夹城，直抵曲江芙蓉苑。玄宗和后妃公主经常通过夹城去曲江游赏。“苑中万物生颜色”一句，写出御驾游苑的豪华奢侈，明珠宝器映照得花木生辉。然后是具体描写唐明皇与杨贵妃游苑的情景。“同辇随君”，事出《汉书·外戚传》。汉成帝游于后宫，曾想与班婕妤同辇载。班婕妤拒绝说：“观古图画，圣贤之君，皆有名臣在侧，三代末主，乃有嬖女。今欲同辇，得无近似之乎？”汉成帝想做而没有做的事，唐玄宗做出来了；被班婕妤拒绝了的事，杨贵妃正干得自鸣得意。这就清楚地说明，唐玄宗不是“贤君”，而是“末主”。笔墨之外，有深意存在。下面又通过写“才人”来写杨贵妃。“才人”是宫中的女官，她们戎装侍卫，身骑以黄金为嚼口笼头的白马，射猎禽兽。侍从们就已经像这样豪华了，那“昭阳殿里第一人”的妃子、那拥有大唐江山的帝王就更不用说了。才人们仰射高空，正好射中比翼双飞的鸟。可惜，这精湛的技艺不是去用来维护天下的太平和国家的统一，却仅仅是为了博得杨贵妃的粲然“一笑”。这些帝王后妃们没有想到，这种放纵的生活，却正是他们亲手种下的祸乱根苗。\n“明眸皓齿今何在”以下八句是第三部分，写诗人在曲江头产生的感慨。分为两层。第一层（“明眸皓齿今何在”至“去住彼此无消息”）直承第二部分，感叹唐玄宗和杨贵妃的悲剧。“明眸皓齿”照应“一笑正坠双飞翼”的“笑”字，把杨贵妃“笑”时的情态补足，生动而自然。“今何在”三字照应第一部分“细柳新蒲为谁绿”一句，把“为谁”二字说得更具体，感情极为沉痛。“血污游魂”点出了杨贵妃遭变横死。长安失陷，身为游魂亦“归不得”，他们自作自受，结局十分凄惨。杨贵妃埋葬在渭水之滨的马嵬，唐玄宗却经由剑阁深入山路崎岖的蜀道，死生异路，彼此音容渺茫。昔日芙蓉苑里仰射比翼鸟，后来马嵬坡前生死两离分，诗人运用这鲜明而又巧妙的对照，指出了他们逸乐无度与大祸临头的因果关系，写得惊心动魄。第二层（“人生有情泪沾臆”至“欲往城南望城北”）总括全篇，写诗人对世事沧桑变化的感慨。前两句是说，人是有感情的，触景伤怀，泪洒胸襟；大自然是无情的，它不随人世的变化而变化，花自开谢水自流，永无尽期。这是以无情反衬有情，而更见情深。最后两句，用行为动作描写来体现他感慨的深沉和思绪的迷惘烦乱。“黄昏胡骑尘满城”一句，把高压恐怖的气氛推向顶点，使开头的“吞声哭”“潜行”有了着落。黄昏来临，为防备人民的反抗，叛军纷纷出动，以致尘土飞扬，笼罩了整个长安城。本来就忧愤交迫的诗人，这时就更加心如火焚，他想回到长安城南的住处，却反而走向了城北。心烦意乱竟到了不辨南北的程度，充分而形象地揭示诗人内心的巨大哀恸。\n在这首诗里，诗人流露的感情是深沉的，也是复杂的。当他表达出真诚的爱国激情的时候，也流露出对蒙难君王的伤悼之情。这是李唐盛世的挽歌，也是国势衰微的悲歌。全篇表现的，是对国破家亡的深哀巨恸。\n“哀”字是这首诗的核心。开篇第一句“少陵野老吞声哭”，就创造出了强烈的艺术氛围，后面写春日潜行是哀，睹物伤怀，忆昔日此地的繁华，而今却萧条零落，还是哀。进而追忆贵妃生前游幸曲江的盛事，以昔日之乐，反衬今日之哀；再转入叙述贵妃升天，玄宗逃蜀，生离死别的悲惨情景，哀之极矣。最后，不辨南北更是极度哀伤的表现。“哀”字笼罩全篇，沉郁顿挫，意境深邈。\n诗的结构，从时间上说，是从眼前翻到回忆，又从回忆回到现实。从感情上说，首先写哀，触类伤情，无事不哀；哀极而乐，回忆唐玄宗、杨贵妃极度逸乐的腐朽生活；又乐极生悲，把亡国的哀恸推向高潮。这不仅写出“乐”与“哀”的因果关系，也造成了强烈的对比效果，以乐衬哀，今昔对照，更好地突出诗人难以抑止的哀愁，造成结构上的波折跌宕，纡曲有致。文笔则发敛抑扬，极开阖变化之妙。\n\n### 名家点评\n\n宋代苏辙《诗病五事》：《大雅·绵》九章，初诵太王迁邠，建都邑，营宫室而已。至其八章，乃曰“肆不殄厥愠，亦不陨厥问”，始及昆夷之怒，尚可也。至其九章，乃曰“虞芮质厥成，文王蹶厥生。予曰有疏附，予曰有先后，予曰有奔奏，予曰有御侮。”事不接，文不属，如连山断岭，虽相去绝远，而气象连络，观者知其脉理之为一也。盖附离不以凿枘，此最为文之高致耳。老杜陷贼时有诗曰：“少陵野老吞声哭……”予爱其词气如百金战马，注坡蓦涧，如履平地，得诗人之遗法。如白乐天诗词甚工，然拙于纪事，才步不遗，犹恐失之，此所以望老杜之藩垣而不及也。\n\n宋代张戒《岁寒堂诗话》：杨太真事，唐人吟咏至多，然类皆无礼。太真配至尊，岂可以儿女黩之耶？惟杜子美则不然。《哀江头》云：“昭阳殿里第一人，同辇随君侍君侧。”不待云“娇侍夜”“醉和春”，而太真之专宠可知；不待云“玉容”“梨花”，而太真之绝色可想也。至于言一时行乐事，不斥言太真，而但言辇前才人，此意尤不可及。如云：“翻身向天仰射云，一笑（“箭”一作“笑”）正坠双飞翼。”不待云“缓歌慢舞凝丝竹，尽日君王看不足”，而一时行乐可喜事，笔端画出，宛在目前。“江水江花岂终极”，不待云“比冀鸟”“连理枝”“此恨绵绵无尽期”，而无穷之恨、泰离麦秀之悲，寄于言外。……其词婉而雅，其意微而有礼，真可谓得风人之旨者。……元、白（《连昌宫词》、《长恨歌》）数十百言竭力摹写，不若子美一句，人才高下乃如此。\n\n明代凌宏宪《唐诗广选》：李耆卿曰：此诗妙在“清渭”二句。明皇、肃宗一去一住，两无消息，父子之间，人所难言，子美能言之，非但“细柳新蒲”之感而已。\n\n明代周珽《唐诗选脉会通评林》：单复曰：同不迫而意已独至。刘辰翁曰：如何一句道尽（按指“细泖新蒲”句）！第常诵之云耳。周敬曰：“吞声哭”三字含悲无限！“清渭”二语怨深却又蕴藉，所以高妙。陆时雍曰：总于起结见情，中间叙事，以老拙见奇。吴山段曰：“潜行”二句有深意，尾句从“潜行”字说出。\n\n明末清初王嗣奭《杜臆》：“一箭”，山谷定为“一笑”，甚妙。曰“中翼”，则箭不必言；而鸟下云中，凡同在者虽百千人，无不哑然发笑，此宴游乐事。\n\n明末清初黄生《杜诗说》：诗意本哀贵妃，不敢斥言，故借江头行幸处，标为题目耳。此诗半露半含，若悲若讯。天宝之乱，实扬氏为祸阶，杜公身事明皇，既不可直陈，又不敢曲违，如此用笔，浅深极为合宜。善述事者，但举一事，时众端可以包括，使人自得于其言外。若纤悉备记，文愈繁而味愈短矣。《长恨歌》，今古脍炙，而《哀江头》无称焉。雅音之不谐俗耳如此。\n\n明末清初朱之荆《增订唐诗摘钞》：写低头暗思，景象如画，此为善写“潜行”二字。\n\n明末清初仇兆鳌《杜诗详注》：潘氏《杜诗博议》云：赵次公注引苏黄门尝谓其侄在进云：《哀江头》即《长恨歌》也。《长恨歌》费数百言而后成。杜言太真被宠，只“昭阳殿里第一人”足矣；言从幸，只“白马嚼啮黄金勒”足矣；言马嵬之死，只“血污游魂归不得”足矣。\n\n清初潘耒《杜诗博议》：赵次公注引苏黄门，尝谓其侄在进云：《哀江头》即《长恨歌》也。《长恨歌》费数百言而后成，杜言太真被宠，只“昭阳殿里第一人”足矣。言从幸，只“白马嚼啮黄金勒”足矣。言马嵬之死，只“血污游魂归不得”足矣。按黄门此论，上言诗法繁简不同耳，但《长恨歌》本因《长恨传》而作，公安得预知其事而为之兴哀。《北征》诗“不闻殷夏衰，中自诛褒妲”，公方以贵妃之死，卜国家中兴，岂应于此诗为天长地久之恨乎？\n\n清代张谦宜《絸斋诗谈》：叙事檃括，不烦不简，有骏马跳涧之势。\n\n清高宗敕编《唐宋诗醇》：所谓对此茫茫，百端交集，何睱计及风刺乎？叙乱离处全以唱叹出之，不用实叙，笔力之高，真不可及。\n\n清代沈德潜《唐诗别裁》：贵妃曰“同”、曰“随”、曰“侍”，似不免乎复；然《诗》有“高朗令终”，《传》有“远哉遥遥”等语，不必苛责（“同辇随君”句下）。“彼此无消息”，犹《长恨歌》云“一别人间两渺茫”也。结出心迷目乱，与入手“潜行”关照（“黄昏胡骑”二句下）。\n\n清代浦起龙《读杜心解》：起四，写哀标意，浮空而来。次八，点清所哀之人，追叙其盛。“明眸”以下，跌落目前；而“去住彼此”，并体贴出明皇心事。“泪沾”“花草”，则作者之哀声也，又回映多姿。\n\n清代杨伦《杜诗镜铨》：蒋弱六云：苦音急调，千古魂消。邵子湘云：转折矫健，略无痕迹，苏黄门谓“如百金战马，注坡蓦涧，如履平地”，信然（《明眸皓齿”二句下）。\n\n清代翁方纲《石洲诗话·渔洋评杜摘记》：“乱离事只叙得两句，‘清渭’以下，以唱叹出之，笔力高不可攀，乐天《长恨歌》便觉相去万里。即两句亦是唱叹，不是实叙。”按：此西樵评，所说皆合，佴不必以《长恨歌》相较量耳。\n\n清代施补华《岘佣说诗》：亦乐府。《丽人行》何等繁华，《哀江头》何等悲惨！两两相比，诗可以兴。\n\n清末高步瀛《唐宋诗举要》：“一箭”句叙苑中射猎，已暗中关合贵妃死马嵬事，何等灵妙！吴曰：更折入深处（“去住彼此”二句下）。悱恻缠绵，令人寻味无尽（“江水江花”句下）。\n\n## 作者简介\n\n杜甫（712—770），唐代现实主义诗人。字子美，尝自称少陵野老。举进士不第，曾任检校工部员外郎，故世称杜工部。宋以后被尊为“诗圣”，与李白并称“李杜”。其诗大胆揭露当时社会矛盾，对穷苦人民寄予深切同情，内容深刻。许多优秀作品，显示了唐代由盛转衰的历史过程，因被称为“诗史”。在艺术上，善于运用各种诗歌形式，尤长于律诗；风格多样，而以沉郁为主；语言精炼，具有高度的表达能力。存诗一千四百多首，有《杜工部集》。"],
